Season 2 - Knightfall saga. Bane breaks out the Arkham inmates and Bruce &amp; Tim deal with that for half the season. Then it becomes Azrael Batman  working with Lucius Fox to further augment himself vs Bane going full venom addict while Bruce journeys to a Lazarus pit to heal himself

I also contest the narrative that Tim is skippable. He’s regularly been included in high profile adaptions like the DCAU, Young Justice, the Arkhamverse, Titans and the Gotham Knights video game. The Batman and Brave and the Bold cartoons didn’t include him, but it wouldn’t have made sense to anyway as one was an early days Batman adaption and the other adapted stories and characters from the Silver age with a few exceptions, thus leading to the Robin in both to naturally be Dick.

I’ll get heat for this next part cuz Reddit, but I also just think it’d be bad optics to omit Tim now that he’s arguably the biggest LGBTQ+ rep in the Batfamily, not to mention in the interest of building out a cinematic universe, you want to give yourself places to go, so why limit spin-off potential by throwing away the only Robin who was able to carry a solo title to 200 issues?

If the DCU were being run by any other hack executive who saw these characters as nothing more than IP, I wouldn’t like Tim’s odds either, but this is James Gunn we’re talking about here, the same guy who touched on just about every member of the Guardians of the Galaxy from the originals to the DnA team.

[],False,,arasitar,,,,[],,,,text,t2_bkuijml5,False,False,"1. So this panel reveals that Anya has been willing to tell *someone*, at least subconsciously, and possibly unbeknownst to her, for quite some time. 

 The toll of not only all the secrets she has to keep about herself and other people, on top of her powers being a big part of her identity - it is how she navigates and understands the world - that would create considerable pressure. 

2. Unfortunately the two people she clearly trusts more than anyone, Loid and Yor, her adoptive parents, she *can't* tell her secret to.  Because it would instantly destroy their fake family. 

 If Anya tells Loid, then Loid realizes that Anya has been lying to him for a long time, and been has manipulating him in various ways (including setting up Loid's first meeting with Yor). Loid also likely realizes how much of WISE has been potentially compromised with Anya's deliberate or accidental mind reading. On top of Anya likely being a danger due to likely some remnants of Project Apple still wanting to find their prized asset. This also likely results in Loid finding out who Yor really is.

 If Anya tells Yor, then Yor realizes that Anya has been lying to him for a long time, and has been manipulating her in various ways (including setting up Yor's first meeting with Loid). Yor also likely realizes how much of The Garden has been potentially compromised with Anya's deliberate or accidental mind reading. Yor would also likely find out her brother works in the secret police. And might have to contend with Anya finding out that she is a brutal murderer. This also likely results in Yor finding out who Loid really is. 

 I don't think even now that Loid and Yor would 'sell out' Anya or send her back to the orphanage (that Anya fears) because even in their most detached moments they want to do the right thing. 

 However when Anya's secret breaks, then everyone else's secret breaks. And that illusion of the fake family that all three have so desperately tried to keep, shatters. That is what Anya's secret means. And all three are forced to confront what this fake family means. Both Loid and Yor have been using the excuse of duty to enjoy this family, and shattering that illusion forces the two to confront what they are truly willing to sacrifice if they want to keep this family. 

 All of this is a lot of pressure that Anya feels. 

3. Both Anya and Damian have felt a...*connection* to each other (this doesn't have to be romantic, or a little crush like Damian's) for some time (see the hijacked bus). This chapter lays out the beats:

 Anya realizes that Damian wants to have a happy family life, same as her, and both Damian and Anya recognize this connection of their deepest desire. (When she recognizes, without mind reading, that Damian loves his father)

 (The dance here is key - notice how they are incredibly clumsy and awkward with each other, but finally *getting into sync* - with Loid standing back as he senses his job is done)

 In the precedent moments, Damian directly compliments Anya's family in his moment of vulnerability, and furthers that connection that both he and her want is a happy family (""*Your* family... sounds nice""). Anya is clearly touched by his, and in classic 5 year old Damian fashion, Damian immediately backtracks because he feels embarrassment for that vulnerability, and just splutters: ""Oh what, I don't know, are you reading my mind or something?""

 Anya either interprets this as a genuine question (or perhaps senses the opportunity she has been internally wanting for so long) and reveals: ""Yes. I can read people's minds.""

 And in classic 5 year old Damian fashion, he can't recognize that Anya is being genuine here, and defaults to (1) clearly ridiculous and (2) Anya watches way too many cartoons (true - Anya is obsessed with Bond, and Anya has often 'embellished' her stories that seem like she is borrowing from cartoons in front of Damian)",False,False,,,,,0.0,1710738972.0,,False,0.0,{},kvdzudj,False,t3_1bh6okn,False,t1_kvdzudj,True,t3_1bh6okn,/r/SpyxFamily/comments/1bh6okn/why_do_you_think_anya_told_damian/kvdzudj/,,1.0,False,True,False,SpyxFamily,t5_yo4xr,r/SpyxFamily,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

Australians entering retirement could lose thousands of dollars by failing to check if their superannuation fund offers a retirement “bonus”, as industry and retail funds quietly launch incentives to help them compete with self-managed super funds by mimicking their tax advantages.

Nearly 30 per cent of funds, including 10 of the nation’s biggest, now offer products dubbed retirement bonuses, according to SuperRatings, although the terms and conditions attached vary wildly.

The bonus idea, pioneered by QSuper (now Australian Retirement Trust) in 2016, comes as super funds face heightened scrutiny over how well they look after members in the retirement phase. Australian Retirement Trust has paid out nearly $100 million so far and industry experts expect the trend to accelerate.

The bonuses are paid to people when they move from accumulation to retirement phase to return an approximate value of the tax that had been set aside to pay potential capital gains liabilities. Capital gains are taxed between 10 and 15 per cent within super, compared to marginal tax rates as high as 45 per cent. There is no legal requirement to compensate super savers for CGT tax withheld.

And while the products are marketed as refunds of tax that had been set aside to pay potential capital gains liabilities (which are extinguished once they hit the zero-tax pension phase) financial advisers and super fund executives are split over the fairest way to calculate the bonuses.

Vince Scully, the chief executive of financial advice firm Life Sherpa, says a growing number of clients are asking about the bonuses, suggesting the phenomenon is catching on.

Scully says that for those approaching retirement, there is a “distinct advantage” to rolling their accumulation phase super into pension phase with an existing fund if a bonus is offered.

“If you take your accumulation fund, and move it to a new super to take out a pension, you don’t get your bonus,” he says.

If somebody wants to take out a pension with a different fund, it may be worth them commencing their pension with their current fund, picking up the bonus, waiting out the relevant clawback period – generally 12 months – and then switching, Scully says.

Most funds do have some form of clawback provision, which means members lose the bonus if they move out of the fund within a given period. Other funds require you to have been with them for a certain amount of time – also typically a year – to be eligible for a bonus.
Bonus, booster, reward

AustralianSuper paid out $13 million in “retirement boosters” in the 2023 financial year to 7700 eligible customers.

Insignia-owned MLC says it has paid an average $2000 per member since it began offering its “pension bonus” in February 2022.

TelstraSuper paid $2.5 million to members in the 2023 financial year, with the bonus capped at $8000 per member.

Brighter Super’s “retirement reward” is capped at $9500.

Leading actuary Michael Rice says retirement bonuses are “clever devices” because the money is only paid out to members if they start an account-based pension with the same fund.

He says the products reflect public offer funds’ awareness of one key advantage SMSFs have: they can wait until all members have retired (and therefore pay zero tax) before selling assets.

“I know of a [SMSF] case where a husband and wife made a profit of $1.3 million on an initial investment of $200,000 in one security,” he says.

“The fund had 80 per cent in pension accounts, so the CGT was 20 per cent of 10 per cent. That is 2 per cent of the gain.

“The APRA-regulated funds recognise the advantage of an SMSF for tax purposes and are trying to counter this – but not very successfully, as they don’t have the records to calculate it properly at member level.”

SuperGuide, a super and retirement planning website, gives the example of a couple, Marieke and Terry, who have been members of the same fund for 20 years and each have $350,000.

While Terry has remained in the balanced option the whole time, Marieke has switched options frequently and only entered the balanced fund six months ago.

When they retire, Terry’s $350,000 balance triggers a retirement bonus of $3500, reflecting the approximate 1 per cent of his balance that had been held aside to pay future – but ultimately unnecessary – capital gains tax.

Because Marieke had only switched recently, she gets $350 because there wasn’t as long for capital gains to accumulate.

SuperGuide founder Robert Barnes anticipates bonuses will be offered by most, if not all, funds over time.

A spokesman for REST notes the fund’s customers are more likely to be female and have worked in care and retail roles and, as such, aren’t as likely to have the funds generally deemed adequate to set up an SMSF.

REST says its bonus is a way to provide “greater equity” and give more cash to people who are likely to be retiring with less than the national average.

But funds use all sorts of different calculations to arrive at a bonus amount.

AustralianSuper calculates its bonuses for each individual based on the purchase and sale of assets throughout the life of the account. A more general approach involves allocating bonuses based on a flat rate percentage of the balance being transferred to pension mode.
Member equity?

“With AustralianSuper, the higher the accrual for unrealised capital gains that has occurred for their investments, the higher the ‘Balance Booster’ will be,” says head of member products Shane Hancock.

“This is fairer from the flat rate approach provided by some other super funds. Members with no accrual for unrealised gains, like those in a cash investment option or with negative or low returns during their investment time, would receive no Balance Booster.”

KPMG tax partner Damian Ryan says while the bonuses are a nice perk for those entering pension phase, it could come at a cost to members still in accumulation phase.

That’s because without a bonus scheme in place, the small tax benefit attached to members moving to pension phase would be spread out across the broader membership pool. This adjustment is made by small changes to unit prices.

“In the past, a fund would true up the deferred tax in unit prices, compared with the fund at a whole,” he says. “All the members with deferred tax accrued in their unit price would have enjoyed the benefit of a proportional reduction [when someone entered the pension phase].”

Some funds disagree, saying the overall sum paid out in retirement bonuses is not significant enough to affect the unit price. Brighter Super, for example, says the amount paid out in the 2023 financial year reflected 0.01 per cent of assets, and as such would have had only a “negligible” impact on unit prices.

Spirit Super notes that super funds have a choice whether to return tax paid by members when shifting from accumulation to pension phase, or to distribute the tax benefits across member cohorts via the unit prices.

At any rate, switching super at retirement needs to be carefully considered, and preferably contemplated well in advance of retirement, Scully says.

“The real thing is that you should really be thinking about your super at least a decade out from retirement.”

Chris Brycki, founder of investment platform Stockspot, says anybody considering switching funds needs to remember fees are one of the two biggest determinants of super balances, the other being correct asset allocation according to member age.

According to the Productivity Commission, a 0.5 percentage point difference in fees could cost a typical full-time worker about 12 per cent of their balance by retirement. That’s about $100,000, significantly more than what most funds offer in retirement bonuses.

“This isn’t free money,” Brycki says. “This is just your money they’re refunding. Just in any other time in your life, you wouldn’t go off and intentionally pay bigger fees just to get a bigger fee refund.”",False,False,,,,,0.0,1710555363.0,,False,0.0,{},kv33tcf,True,t3_1bfvan2,False,t1_kv33tcf,True,t3_1bfvan2,/r/fiaustralia/comments/1bfvan2/superannuation_funds_have_quietly_started_paying/kv33tcf/,,1.0,False,False,False,fiaustralia,t5_39zkf,r/fiaustralia,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting follow up to the recent discussion on pooled fund options in super.

&gt; I don't think I'm a ""bad person"" in terms of just my self perception within a void. I know my intentions are good, but I can't help but wonder whether the unintentional harm I cause is ""fair"". Regardless of intent, harm is harm in the end. Though subjective.

Yes!  This is one of the things that I think resonated with people about *Edward Scissorhands*.  ""I just want to hug you, but if I try, I know I'll hurt you.  I don't want to hurt you, but I can't help it, I don't know how to avoid it.""

You're right about all of this.  Our *intent* is to be good.  But intent isn't magic, if we end up hurting others, that's bad.  So it's imperative to learn how to avoid doing that.  Which I'm still trying to figure out how to do.

I know to allists the answer's obvious, ""Stop thinking about it and just *do it* as comes naturally!""  But that's the problem, it *doesn't* come naturally to me.  If I don't think about it consciously, I don't do it.  And I honestly don't know how agreeable I can be in realtime, without studying and dissecting each interaction afterwards.  But I'm trying.

&gt; Double empathy is an interesting term that I must put some research into.

The phrase you want to search for is the ""double empathy problem"", coined by Damian Milton.  He realised that sure, we can't easily predict allists, but they can't easily predict us either (some scientific papers on us are pitiful), so there's certainly some nuance to be had there.

My view is Ayton's style of play is not for the modern game. DeAndre's style fits 1970s NBA basketball. He would have done well in the '90s too, but in 2023-24, the emphasis is on guard play and outside shooting. Chauncey Billups coaches the Five-Out Offense, which is a strategic approach that positions all five players around the perimeter, maximizing floor spacing, promoting ball movement, and facilitating driving lanes for ball handlers.

My view is Ayton&amp;#39;s style of play is not for the modern game. DeAndre&amp;#39;s style fits 1970s NBA basketball. He would have done well in the &amp;#39;90s too, but in 2023-24, the emphasis is on guard play and outside shooting. Chauncey Billups coaches the Five-Out Offense, which is a strategic approach that positions all five players around the perimeter, maximizing floor spacing, promoting ball movement, and facilitating driving lanes for ball handlers.

&amp;#x200B;

Tex Walker: Key forwards are way too inconsistent, the only reason he is worth 500K is because of his big bags against WCE. He will have many games well below 100 and will likely not reach the total he scored this year, especially with the development of Adelaide's other forwards. Move Harley Reid to the forward line in his place. This gives you 300K to work with a player. 

Tobey Greene is also not a great choice for the same reason as Tex. Great player but not for Supercoach. Trade down to either Fisher, Fyfe, Harmes, Billings. This trade as well will add at least 100K to your side. Or go for Sam Flanders who will likely get more midfield minutes, at least according to Damian Hardwick. 

Luke Jackson is another iffy one. Could be good but with Darcy playing as well I can't see him scoring for his price consistently. I'd trade him for any of the players mentioned before since forwards just aren't that strong this season and using that money in a more reliable mid or defender premo is the better strat.

With those three adjustments, you should have 300 from Reid and at least another 100 but more likely closer to 300-400k from the other two trades, giving you close to 700K available for a player in your midfield. At that price you really can't go wrong with your choice, ideally skip a player who is gonna have an early bye but not the end of the world if you go for say Tom Green or Lachie Neale. Ultimately at this point it is luck that you just choose the right premium who is gonna dominate. If you didn't earn quite that much money from the trades (say you chose both Fyfe and Fisher for Jackson and Greene) then someone like Newcombe or Steele is a great choice as an almost premo price who will likely become premium. 

Nic Newman is a gun but with a better bye round, slightly cheaper and likely to breach 600K this season, Hayden Young is hard to miss. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ivan Soldo is an interesting choice. He is not guaranteed to be Port's #1 ruck and even if he is, he's never demonstrated the ability to be a premium ruck. Grundy at a similar price is a better option, although neither were outstanding in pre season. Keep an eye on Grundy in the opening round because getting him at 460K is a steal if he can reach his 100 points a game level (which isn't even his peak).

&gt; On December 5, 2018, documents obtained in the probe of Six4Three were released by Parliament. Damian Collins, the MP who issued the order compelling the handover of the documents in November, highlighted six key points from the documents:
&gt;
&gt;Facebook entered into whitelisting agreements with Lyft, Airbnb, Bumble, and Netflix, among others, allowing those groups full access to friends data after Graph API v1 was discontinued. Collins indicates “It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted or not.”
According to Collins, “increasing revenues from major app developers was one of the key drivers behind the Platform 3.0 changes at Facebook. The idea of linking access to friends data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”
&gt;
&gt;Data reciprocity between Facebook and app developers was a central focus for the release of Platform v3, with Zuckerberg discussing charging developers for access to API access for friend lists.
Internal discussions of changes to the Facebook Android app acknowledge that requesting permissions to collect calls and texts sent by the user would be controversial, with one project manager stating it was “a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective.”
Facebook used data collected through Onavo, a VPN service the company acquired in 2013, to survey the use of mobile apps on smartphones. According to Collins, this occurred “apparently without [users’] knowledge,” and was used by Facebook to determine “which companies to acquire, and which to treat as a threat.”
&gt;
&gt;Collins contends that “the files show evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps, with the consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of that business.” Documents disclosed specifically indicate Facebook revoked API access to video sharing service Vine.
&gt;
&gt;In a statement, Facebook claimed, “Six4Three… cherrypicked these documents from years ago.” Zuckerberg responded separately to the public disclosure on Facebook, acknowledging, “Like any organization, we had a lot of internal discussion and people raised different ideas.” He called the Facebook scrutiny “healthy given the vast number of people who use our services,” but said it shouldn’t “misrepresent our actions or motives.”

&gt; Saint Peter Damian, (born 1007, Ravenna—died Feb. 22, 1072, Faenze; feast day February 21), Italian cardinal and Doctor of the Church. He was prior of Fonte Avellana in the Apennines before being named a cardinal in 1057.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; A leading monastic reformer and ascetic, he played an important role in the **promotion of apostolic poverty and in support of papal reformers who sought to enforce clerical celibacy and abolish simony**. He defended Pope Alexander II against the antipope Honorius II and reconciled Alexander with the city of Ravenna.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;

&gt; He was also sent as a papal legate to resolve disputes in Milan and Cluny, Burgundy, and he played a key role in the **formulation of the papal election decree of 1059 [where choosing the pope is to be done by cardinals]**.

* https://www.britannica.com/summary/Saint-Peter-Damian

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Little is known for certain about Peter Damian’s early life before his entrance into the hermitage of Fonte Avellana in the diocese of Gubbio (now Cagli-Pergola, Italy) in the Apennines. The facts must be pieced out primarily from his surviving letters and from his biography by John of Lodi. These documents reveal that Damian’s parents died shortly after his birth and that an older brother raised him and gave him his initial education in Ravenna. Beginning in his early teens, Damian spent at least 10 years studying the liberal arts at Ravenna, Faenza, and Parma. His writings throughout his life indicate a broad knowledge of Classical and Christian works, training that helped make Damian one of the finest Latin stylists of the Middle Ages.

&gt; …

&gt; The ideals of the [clerical] reform movement are particularly evident in Damian’s tract **Liber gratissimus (1052; “Most-Favoured Book”), which treated the problem of simony (the purchase of ecclesiastical office) and the validity of the sacraments bestowed by a simoniac cleric**. Although he strongly condemned the purchase of office by clergymen, Damian defended the validity of the sacraments they administered. In **Liber Gomorrhianus** (“Book of Gomorrah”), written about 1051, he addressed the other central concern of reformers during this period, the question of celibacy versus clerical marriage (nicolaitism)**. His rhetorical advocacy of celibacy was so excessive, however, that Pope Leo chose not to give it the unconditional support he offered to Damian’s tract on simony.

&gt; …

&gt; In addition to many letters and theological tracts, his abundant and varied writings include 53 sermons, 7 vitae (saints’ lives), and liturgical pieces. Two tracts in particular merit special note. The first, **a tract against the Jews, must be viewed in the light of the growing anti-Semitism of the 11th century**; the other, his most important theological tract, De divina omnipotentia (“On Divine Omnipotence”), reveals both the profundity of his thought and the extraordinary eloquence of his pen.

&gt; …

&gt; … Damian’s championship of the eremitical ideal **helped to establish firmly the link between Byzantine eremitism and the Western Benedictine ideal**. In so doing, he prepared the way for the individual spirituality seen in the vita apostolica (“apostolic life”), the supreme example of which is St. Francis of Assisi.

Then move on to more advanced books like the famous one by Mike Goodrich. 

Be efficient and effective with your time. Spend a few minutes to design a practice schedule each week: It might look like this:

Scales/arpreggios exercise: 10 min (from Jody Fisher Jazz series)

Songwriting/composing: 10 mins (Jon Damian's book listed above is good for working through on this)

I'd add improvisation to this, but only after you've learned scales etc. If you follow Jody Fisher's method, you'll get to improve exercises soon enough.

Evolution meets revolution at Twickenham this weekend. Talk of four-year cycles is often tedious, but it has been intriguing to see England and Wales begin their respective rebuilds in different ways.

Encouraged by several injuries and retirements, Warren Gatland ripped off the band aid before this Six Nations and has opted for seven further changes to the line-up that ran on against Scotland in round one. The method might seem volatile, but he can point to previous experience of revamping teams. For Dafydd Jenkins, the young Wales skipper personifying a fresh start, read Sam Warburton in 2011.

Steve Borthwick was always likely to adopt a steadier approach, even as it became clear that England would begin this tournament without a raft of high-profile players. His match-day squad for Saturday, showing an unchanged starting line-up for the first time in his tenure, is an archetypal blend of experience and youth.

New coaches, and a palpable change of style, give another dimension to England’s remodel. And that also begs big questions for selection. Do you find new players to suit systems? Or do you trust older dogs to learn unfamiliar tricks?

“There’s always a jigsaw that you want to get right,” admitted Richard Wigglesworth, the England attack coach, on Tuesday. “You’re fitting the pieces together, whether that be experience, continuity, style of play, what suits.”

“And I wouldn’t want to force the way that I see the game, or my beliefs on anyone. I want to create a framework for them to play their best rugby, because that’s the way that we want them to go out there.”

**Felix Jones is embedding something similar to Exeter’s blitz defence**   
Inevitably, as most sides do, the England team will gradually morph on the road to 2027. We can already see some signs of change. The prompt introduction of Immanuel Feyi-Waboso, over other contenders such as Joe Cokanasiga, will have been influenced – at least in part – by the wing’s success as part of an up-and-in blitz defence at Exeter Chiefs. Felix Jones is obviously embedding something similar in England’s template.

Wigglesworth pointed out that Henry Slade, a key figure as Borthwick’s visitors settled in Rome and suffocated Italy during the second half, has adjusted to the strategy at club level.

“I think you saw Sladey come up with a few big moments,” Wigglesworth said. “In terms of how he defends, it would have been closer to what we would do.

“But that wasn’t a ‘this is what gets you selected’. It’s probably a bonus of the experience he can pass on. \[Slade will able to say to team-mates:\] ‘When I first started doing this, this is how I felt.’”

Ethan Roots is another Chief who thrived, Borthwick having volunteered him as a potential debutant a month previously. The ball-carrying of Roots was another factor in his fast-tracking, with Chandler Cunningham-South seeming to jump the pecking order onto the bench on the same basis.

One must remember that Marcus Smith and Ollie Lawrence would have been in the shake-up to face Italy. The latter may return at Murrayfield in round three, as could George Martin. England clearly need to identify scrummagers to succeed Dan Cole (36) and Joe Marler (33) as well.

There are other, subtler clues as to England’s future direction. Raffi Quirke, enduring a horrible run of injuries, was named on a rehabilitation list at the beginning of the Six Nations; proof that Borthwick is monitoring him. Having served an apprenticeship under Faf de Klerk at Sale Sharks, the livewire scrum-half would be very useful in a defensive framework designed by Felix Jones. Still 22, Quirke is a skilful footballer and a threatening runner.

Successful sides consider how the profile of a player will fit their tactical approach. It was a milestone moment, for instance, when Andy Farrell promoted Jamison Gibson-Park over Conor Murray to enhance the speed of Ireland’s phase-play. Mack Hansen was initially brought in as a replacement for James Lowe. Then Farrell realised that both of his wings could be roaming ball-players.

France possess lithe line-out jumpers such as Charles Ollivon in the back row. One of their locks, therefore, can be a brawny enforcer who scrums behind the tighthead prop and adds ballast to the gain-line battle. Posolo Tuilagi fits that bill snugly. On Friday, after he arrived from the bench, France did not even bother to deploy Tuilagi in some line-outs. They left him in midfield to carry. Emmanuel Meafou will perform a similarly muscular remit.

A home series loss to Ireland in 2022 encouraged the All Blacks to integrate more mobile props, Ethan de Groot and Tyrel Lomax, and to move Jordie Barrett to inside centre ahead of last year’s World Cup. The winners of that tournament, South Africa, have had specific positional demands within their defensive system.

Their full-backs, Willie le Roux and Damian Willemse, have been prominent figures. The Springboks reimagined a traditional back-field pendulum, asking their full-backs to be able to bolt up into the front line beyond their blitzing wings and ‘shut the door’ to attacks. Felix Jones is applying the formula to England.

“In the new system, I’m having to be involved a lot more in terms of presence in the front line and closing \[space\],” said Freddie Steward this week. “It’s slightly more aggressive than previous systems, perhaps, but I love it. It’s exciting. Instead of being parked at the back, you’re able to get on the end of the line and make some reads.

- When I realized Adnan Syed literally placed himself with Hae in her car as the last person to ever see her alive. By his own initial statement he IS the last person to ever see her alive and for some reason needs to borrow her car when he drove his own car to campus? It’s literally an excuse made to justify having been with her in her car where she was strangled. His statements changed multiple times and the most logical explanation is that he killed Hae and convinced Jay to help him dispose of her body. His phone pinged at the park too when she would’ve been disposed of, but even him being in that general area, despite the HUGE debate on pings in the true crime community, implicates him as being guilty as hell. When I realized it’s a pretty simple crime of him feeling betrayed by her new relationship after having been controlling to her several times before, he killed her when she wouldn’t take him back. Controlling partners can escalate often, he has the most motive and direct opportunity as his OWN statement shows. 

- The West Memphis 3 I believe are guilty as well, but I can’t remember all of the reasons 🤣 Don’t get me wrong, the documentaries were great and I love metal and wearing black myself. But when I actually stepped back and read about other aspects the case, it became pretty clear that Damian is a narcissist who is totally capable of this crime, with help of course. Not to mention that the confession given by one of the three had information not released to the public but lined up very well with the crime scene! 

- Scott Peterson is guilty as hell. I was little when his trial was happening so I had no idea then, but as an adult I watched the Hulu doc on him which postulates he could be innocent. I kinda wavered but after you do real research it’s pretty obvious he did it. I hope they don’t waste too much money on this scum with the LA innocence project 🤢 

- I think Madeline McCann’s parents found her dead or there was an accident and they saw it. Either way I do believe they were responsible for disposing of her body. Especially after I learned that key witnesses who saw a man carrying a child out remarked that the man looked like Jerry McCann. Plus cadaver dogs picked up on a dead body having been in the trunk of the McCann’s car. It’s a shame they have the money to sue people who publicly say they are responsible for this whole thing, because quite frankly they deserve jail time. They were already negligent with leaving their kids alone in a hotel room to go drink and have consistently talked about Madeline in such a cold way. I don’t like body language stuff because it’s unreliable like polygraphs, but their demeanor about the whole thing is f*cking weird. The witch-hunt these two have gone on in the name of justice is truly sickening if they do know what actually happened, and I think they do. I think Madeline died that night she went “missing”, but public opinion (myself previously included) tends to think that two doctors would NEVER do something like this. But nobody knows how they would react in any situation and any human being is capable of deceit given their motivations. 

- I used to think Jennifer Kesse was abducted by a worker at her complex until I learned about her creepy co-worker (not the married one). I believe he was stalking her and killed her. The last ping on her phone was near his apartment and he’s since moved back to Columbia. He’s also posted some very creepy things about her on Facebook. ALSO, 29 days after he was fired for making false claims against another coworker, an anonymous tip came into Orlando PD about Jennifer having been buried in a field right by his apartment. I’m curious if he found out since dogs and police searched and the dogs hit on human remains having been there but were not there when they checked. It’s all too creepy to me to be pure coincidence, and apparently he was creepy as hell (according to a previous coworker). Idk, could all be coincidence but I think someone with his motive and having known her personally are a good fit for the crime. I don’t believe she was trafficked, I believe he killed her either by accident or premeditated.

Elizabeth “Lizzie” Marston Prince is, as of now, the future daughter of Wonder Woman, who Tom King’s run is building up to. So far we’ve only seen her in the narrative framing device, teaming up with Jon Kent and Damian Wayne to go listen to Sovereign recount the story of her birth, and a few back up stories where the Super Sons babysit her, but already everyone seems to have a pretty good grasp of her character as a confident and brash young woman. There are a number of commentators who find her kind of obnoxious, and seem to feel she has Damian's problem of becoming the “One True Robin” just by virtue of being Wonder Woman’s daughter at the expense of every other Wonder Girl, and others who seem to enjoy her well enough—to put it bluntly, she is a very polarizing character at the moment.

I myself feel that she is too pushed at the moment: the run is starting at the end, pushing the fact that Trinity is the new Wonder Girl instead of building up to her character and introduction. And I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin. But despite recent controversies, I’m perfectly happy to have another character who can stand out in the Wonder family, and hope she will grow into a compelling character. One question I have is why she has the three lassos she has: Lasso of Truth is obvious, but the Lasso of Lies seems like something that would be thrown into a vault under lock and key once Sovereign is beaten. Still not sure what her third lasso is. It kind of looks like Donna Troy’s?

Another confusion I have is her name: Elizabeth Marston Prince is a very anglophonic name. And Prince isn’t Diana’s actual last name, it’s just something she uses when she wants to have a secret identity for a few minutes. And Lizzie’s birth mother is also an Amazon, so I would expect a more Greek name. I guess it comes from her yet unrevealed father? Questions for the future, I suppose…

But despite recent controversies, I’m perfectly happy to have another character who can stand out in the Wonder family, and hope she will grow into a compelling character. One question I have is why she has the three lassos she has: Lasso of Truth is obvious, but the Lasso of Lies seems like something that would be thrown into a vault under lock and key once Sovereign is beaten. Still not sure what her third lasso is. It kind of looks like Donna Troy’s?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another confusion I have is her name: Elizabeth Marston Prince is a very anglophonic name. And Prince isn’t Diana’s actual last name, it’s just something she uses when she wants to have a secret identity for a few minutes. And Lizzie’s birth mother is also an Amazon, so I would expect a more Greek name. I guess it comes from her yet unrevealed father? Questions for the future, I suppose…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if she travels back in time like Rachael Summers or Cable and stays forever as a permanent member of the cast, I quit. Those bullshit future timeline children plots are a quarter of the reason I don’t read X-men.&lt;/p&gt;

Not just any Robin but one who forces Batman more than ever to adhere to the light because of his young partner dark past as a still reforming killer. Until we get the story of what&amp;#39;s motivating current Tim, he&amp;#39;s not going to be able to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to say give him a detective story but that&amp;#39;s not so easy. If it were then Batman would already be getting those. Detective stories are only as good as the writers are which is why only Dick and bruce so far have ever had decent detective stories [because they&amp;#39;ve had over 80 years to amass stories]&lt;/p&gt;

“It’s a martial art”, I explained.

“Oh, cool.” She said it almost dismissively.

Today, my supervisor Damian approached me while I was mixing chemicals. “Mary, can you help me get something?”

“Sure.”

I followed him to a hall, and he opened a door to a supply closet.

Something mounted on the wall caught my eye. It was a plaque with a picture of Mill. “1990-2012”, it read. 

“The hell?”, I said.

“What?”, asked Damian.

“That girl is Mill.”

“Hmm…strange.”

The next day, I sat at Joe’s (a restaurant we love) on the patio. She sat across from me. “Mill, do you have something that you want to share?”

She looked confused. “No?”

“Are you a…ghost?!”

She laughed. “No, no. I’m a zombie.”

My eyes widened. “Uh…you’re just gonna say that casually?”

“Well, there’s something else…I live at Angelica’s Mansion.”

“Who?”

“Angelica’s Mansion is a haunted house attraction. You should come over.”

“I…uh…”

“I gotta advertise, you know?”

“I guess I’ll come?”

She drove down a road through a forest. In the clearing ahead lay a mansion. The front yard was huge, and in front of it was a metal gate. She pulled up to it, and we got out. She produced a key and put it into the lock. She opened it, and we walked across the grass. The front door had a skull knocker, and she used it. A ghost woman answered. She wore a small white dress, and her hair matched. “Welcome!”, she said to me with enthusiasm.

“Thanks.”

“Come in. Gerald just baked something for us.”

We walked into the front room. The ghost floated into the hall to the right. We followed her into a dining room. A wolfman sat there, and he ate donuts of off a silver platter. Another platter with more sat in the center of the table. “AH, yeah!”, exclaimed Mill. She ran up to the table and grabbed one. She bit into it. “It’s sour…I like it.” She looked at me. “Want one?”

“I’m good.”

“So, what’s your name?”, the ghost asked me.

“Mary.”

“I’m Jess. Nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you.”

“Feel free to walk around the place. If you slip on ectoplasm, that’s my fault. Sorry.”

The wolfman collapsed to the ground. 

“Harry?!”, cried the ghost, looking to him. She looked dizzy before collapsing onto the ground. 

“What the-”, started Mill, looking at the two unconscious bodies. Her lip trembled and her eyes were wide. Now, Mill looked dizzy. She fell, but I lunged at her and caught her. I carefully laid her onto the floor. It’s the doughnuts. Something fishy is going on in this place. I ran to the hall ahead. A staircase was at the end. I ascended it up to a door. I opened it to see the flat rooftop. On it was a massive machine with a cone pointed at the city. It had a keyboard attached. A man in a lab coat stood there and turned to me, confused.

“Who are you?!”

“Mary. You’re the baker?”

“Yes. You didn’t take a donut?”

“I don’t like sour stuff.”

He got serious. “Well, Mary, let me explain my evil scheme. The mayor has hated monsters for years now. He’s even talked about it publicly, so I decided to kill him. This laser will destroy city hall!”

I ran at him and lunged forward with my foot out. He dodged and said, “It’s too late. This laser will fire momentarily.” I went for a low sweep, and he fell.

Morgan Stanley claimed it had the most confidential block trading operation, but prosecutors said it was secretly leaking info to hedge funds to lessen its risk, costing sellers millions

Morgan Stanley’s pitch to sellers looking to unload big blocks of stock was that their block-trading unit was the best at preventing leaks that could drive share prices down.

But federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission now say it was all a lie, and that from 2018 through 2021 the bank would quietly divulge news of the impending block trades to hedge funds as a way of lessening its own risk. The result was that sellers would lose millions of dollars on the deal, investigators said.

In simultaneous announcements Friday, the Department of Justice and the SEC charged Morgan Stanley MS, -0.71% and the head of its equity syndicate desk, Pawan Passi, with fraud, and levied fines against the bank totaling $249 million. Passi was hit with a $250,000 fine from the SEC, and is barred from working in any supervisory or associate roles, or serving as a broker in the sale of penny stocks. He had been placed on leave from Morgan Stanley when prosecutors opened their probe and was later dismissed. 

The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan said it had entered into non-prosecution agreements with the bank and Passi to resolve federal criminal charges. Both Morgan Stanley and the Bank agreed under a deal to pay the financial penalties and cooperate with the government’s probe.

“Morgan Stanley, through the supervisor of its block trades business, Pawan Passi, deceived block sellers by promising confidentiality knowing that they would turn around and share that information with others to use to trade,” said Manhattan’s U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. “We are watching.  And we will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to root out fraud in our financial markets.”

In a statement, Morgan Stanley said it was “pleased to resolve these investigations and are confident in the enhancements we have made to our controls around block trading, including strengthening our policies, procedures, training and surveillance.”

Passi’s lawyer, George Canellos, said in a statement, “We are pleased that the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed not to pursue a criminal conviction of Mr. Passi in this complex matter.”

Block trading involves the private sale of large amounts of shares of a publicly-traded company all in one transaction, often at a discount to current market prices. Sellers, typically private equity firms, corporate insiders or firms holding large positions in a stock, often seek out such deals as a way to guarantee a price and enable them to unload their shares in one go, rather than take their chances with the volatility of the open market.

If the transaction goes smoothly, the bank then turns around and sells the shares at a price higher than the discounted price they granted the initial seller, pocketing the difference. From 2018 through 2021, Morgan Stanley earned $1.4 billion in revenue from such trades, prosecutors said.

One key aspect of such a deal is that it be kept confidential, as any leak of an impending block sale can drive the stock price down ahead of the transaction, affecting the price the seller can get.

Prosecutors said that Morgan Stanley marketed its block-trading operation as the most secure in the business — pointing out that it operated out of a side of the bank that was completely separate from its buy-side units, lessening the chance of leaks.

According to court filings, Passi and members of his team, however, would immediately inform a group of hedge funds they worked with about the impending block sales, allowing the funds to either short the stock or make adjustments to any long positions they might have.

Those moves typically would drive the share prices down ahead of closing the block trade, allowing Morgan Stanley to buy at a lower price, investigators said.

The agreement with the hedge funds would be that when the dust settled, the funds would agree to buy the shares from Morgan Stanley at a price that allowed the bank and the funds to make money. However, the transaction would often result in the original seller receiving a lesser price than they would have received had the leak not occurred.

“Sellers entrusted Morgan Stanley and Passi with material non-public information concerning upcoming block trades with the full expectation and understanding that they would keep it confidential,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Instead, Morgan Stanley and Passi abused that trust by leaking that same information and using it to position themselves ahead of those trades.”",False,False,,,,,0.0,1705084998.0,,False,0.0,{},khjzfph,False,t3_19528ri,False,t1_khjzfph,True,t3_19528ri,/r/Superstonk/comments/19528ri/morgan_stanley_pantsed/khjzfph/,,1.0,True,True,False,Superstonk,t5_43zwn1,r/Superstonk,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley’s pitch to sellers looking to unload big blocks of stock was that their block-trading unit was the best at preventing leaks that could drive share prices down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission now say it was all a lie, and that from 2018 through 2021 the bank would quietly divulge news of the impending block trades to hedge funds as a way of lessening its own risk. The result was that sellers would lose millions of dollars on the deal, investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simultaneous announcements Friday, the Department of Justice and the SEC charged Morgan Stanley MS, -0.71% and the head of its equity syndicate desk, Pawan Passi, with fraud, and levied fines against the bank totaling $249 million. Passi was hit with a $250,000 fine from the SEC, and is barred from working in any supervisory or associate roles, or serving as a broker in the sale of penny stocks. He had been placed on leave from Morgan Stanley when prosecutors opened their probe and was later dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan said it had entered into non-prosecution agreements with the bank and Passi to resolve federal criminal charges. Both Morgan Stanley and the Bank agreed under a deal to pay the financial penalties and cooperate with the government’s probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Morgan Stanley, through the supervisor of its block trades business, Pawan Passi, deceived block sellers by promising confidentiality knowing that they would turn around and share that information with others to use to trade,” said Manhattan’s U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. “We are watching.  And we will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to root out fraud in our financial markets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Morgan Stanley said it was “pleased to resolve these investigations and are confident in the enhancements we have made to our controls around block trading, including strengthening our policies, procedures, training and surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passi’s lawyer, George Canellos, said in a statement, “We are pleased that the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed not to pursue a criminal conviction of Mr. Passi in this complex matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block trading involves the private sale of large amounts of shares of a publicly-traded company all in one transaction, often at a discount to current market prices. Sellers, typically private equity firms, corporate insiders or firms holding large positions in a stock, often seek out such deals as a way to guarantee a price and enable them to unload their shares in one go, rather than take their chances with the volatility of the open market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the transaction goes smoothly, the bank then turns around and sells the shares at a price higher than the discounted price they granted the initial seller, pocketing the difference. From 2018 through 2021, Morgan Stanley earned $1.4 billion in revenue from such trades, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of such a deal is that it be kept confidential, as any leak of an impending block sale can drive the stock price down ahead of the transaction, affecting the price the seller can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that Morgan Stanley marketed its block-trading operation as the most secure in the business — pointing out that it operated out of a side of the bank that was completely separate from its buy-side units, lessening the chance of leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to court filings, Passi and members of his team, however, would immediately inform a group of hedge funds they worked with about the impending block sales, allowing the funds to either short the stock or make adjustments to any long positions they might have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those moves typically would drive the share prices down ahead of closing the block trade, allowing Morgan Stanley to buy at a lower price, investigators said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement with the hedge funds would be that when the dust settled, the funds would agree to buy the shares from Morgan Stanley at a price that allowed the bank and the funds to make money. However, the transaction would often result in the original seller receiving a lesser price than they would have received had the leak not occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sellers entrusted Morgan Stanley and Passi with material non-public information concerning upcoming block trades with the full expectation and understanding that they would keep it confidential,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Instead, Morgan Stanley and Passi abused that trust by leaking that same information and using it to position themselves ahead of those trades.”&lt;/p&gt;

In a grand room in the Reform Club on London’s Pall Mall last night, the One Nation caucus of Tory MPs gathered for their New Year’s reception. Despite their size (with 106 members, it is the largest Tory grouping), the caucus has been accused of failing to wield the influence of the smaller groups on the party’s right. Those self-proclaimed “five families” – from the New Conservatives to the European Research Group – pushed Rishi Sunak to go further in overriding the courts’ opposition to the Rwanda scheme.

In response, senior One Nation members have told the New Statesman that they are hoping to increase its influence within the party in coming months. The return of the Rwanda bill next week is a key test. The caucus has two red lines: the bill must ensure that migrants have a right of appeal against deportation and it must not break an international treaty. A second test will be whether the Budget in March contains “tax cuts for the many, not the few”. If a cut to inheritance tax is included by Jeremy Hunt that would be seen by some One Nation MPs as a sign of their failure to influence No 10.

But given its size, why does the caucus seem to punch below its weight in the first place? Some point to the fact so many of its members are bound by collective responsibility as ministers.

They can’t, for instance, call a press conference and launch into a bombastic tirade against the PM. Equally, having members in government increases the group’s power within government, if not in parliamentary backroom deals. “Sunak isn’t a One Nation Tory, but his cabinet is,” as one put it.

At the same time, I understand that One Nation chair Damian Green has “regular” meetings with the Prime Minister. But is it not a sign of the group’s insignificance that these meetings are so obscure compared to those with the party’s right? Some One Nation members think more MPs should be in those meetings to demonstrate to Sunak the breadth of support the caucus commands. The key is converting its large number of members, and therefore parliamentary votes, into influence.

Debate is ongoing over whether Green is the best person to achieve that. While he carries weight as a former first secretary of state, he is not a flawless media performer. When asked whether the One Nation caucus requires fresh leadership, some members turn sheepish. Green recently told my colleague Anoosh Chakelian: “I will carry on as long as I, and more importantly others, think it’s useful for me to… I’ll do it until the election, and then we’ll see what happens. One Nation Conservatism needs to carry on.”

What began as a lofty dining club dominated by grandees such as Ken Clarke and Nicholas Soames morphed into a caucus in 2019 with an eye to ensuring a liberal succeeded Theresa May. This is part of the problem. The purpose of the caucus is ambiguous. Different members believe it should be for different things. “We’re a caucus, it’s in the word, and not a grouping,” said one MP who almost blushed at the prospect of being more bullish.

Aston Villa’s winter transfer window: Marcos Acuna, Lucas Digne and Bertrand Traore
By Jacob Tanswell
4h ago
Aston Villa head into January well-placed. Firmly in the race for Champions League qualification, the winter window is more of an opportunity to refine and tweak rather than a desperate scramble for new signings to provide uplift.

This time last year, Villa were keen to furnish head coach Unai Emery with at least one signing and, in the form of Alex Moreno, an entirely Emery-led pursuit, they sanctioned a low-cost, highly effective deal.

The club’s broader recruitment team also signed Jhon Duran, regarded by inner footballing circles as possessing the potential to be one of the best young forwards in the world and he is already showing green shoots.

The Athletic takes you through what to expect from Villa this winter window…

Last three January window spends
January 2021 = £14.2million (€16.53m, $17.85m)

January 2022 = £27million

January 2023 = £26million

How much money is likely to be available?
Manoeuvrability is there for Emery. The 52-year-old says he is happy with his squad and will increasingly rely on its peripheral figures in the coming weeks, but allowing those deemed expendable to leave would enable Villa to strengthen in the wide areas.

Villa are still tight on financial fair play (FFP) regulations, so following similar trends from the previous three windows is not out of the question. They spent £76million in the summer and recouped £28m to add to a balance sheet that needed work anyway.

It is accepted internally that they need to continue to find different commercial streams and to increase revenue to allow Villa to spend within FFP constraints, but if the right player is identified by Emery and president of football operations Monchi, the club will make concerted efforts to buy them. Emery, Monchi and the club’s owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris are due to meet in the coming days to establish what positions, if any, require additions and the type of player available. Emery does not want to sign anyone who will not represent an upgrade.

Who makes the key decisions on signings?
Following the arrival of Emery’s former Sevilla colleague Monchi in the summer, he and director of football Damian Vidagany take care of transfer negotiations and act as sounding boards for any queries from agents and players.

Both have a close relationship with Emery and know what player he wants and fits within Villa’s framework. Emery does not get involved in the details of negotiations for players, only coming in towards the end of a deal. The three decision-makers lead critical football-related matters and have formed a ‘triangle of power’, with their scouting network including an influx of Spanish-speaking recruits, all of whom report to Monchi.

The targets identified will then be worked through by Monchi and Emery, who are likely to have pre-existing knowledge of the player.

Vidagany is a transparent and frank communicator in his dealings with players and agents, informing them via email and in meetings if they should seek another club. This summer, he told certain players they could leave provided they came to Villa with a buyer, outlining the sort of fees the club were looking for in each case.

What are the priority positions?
There is a growing feeling that Emery wants to strengthen at right-back, with Matty Cash the only specialist option currently in the squad. A right-back to provide competition and support to Cash appears an increasing priority, with Emery wanting to upgrade in most areas since arriving 13 months ago.

A winger has also been considered after a late but ultimately decided-against move for Jack Harrison in the summer, who joined Everton. Presently, Leon Bailey, who is entering the final two years of his deal and is due to soon sit down and discuss an extension, is the only out-and-out winger used by Emery.

What do we know about who the targets might be?
Marcos Acuna was the left-back Villa wanted intently in the summer and may do so again despite the outstanding form of Lucas Digne. Emery had deep-seated knowledge of Acuna from managing against him in La Liga, while Monchi knew and had worked with him during their time at Sevilla.

Marcos Acuna

He fitted Villa’s preference for a more adventurous left-back who could essentially become a quasi-left-winger in possession: he was used on the left wing at times for Argentina during their success at last year’s World Cup.

However, any deal would only likely materialise in the summer, paving the way for Digne to leave after a move away was discussed among the Villa hierarchy at the start of last pre-season. Even accounting for his impressive form at left-back, starting every Premier League fixture this season, he is among the highest earners at £120,000 per week and his departure would alleviate the financial books.

Elsewhere, on the opposite side, Bayer Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong has been heavily linked to Villa, but a move for him would be prohibitively expensive, similar to Villarreal midfielder Alex Baena. Frimpong is contracted to the Bundesliga club until 2028 and a deal would significantly eat into Villa’s summer budget. Frimpong is adept at playing as a right-winger in possession and would reunite his formidable partnership with former Leverkusen player Moussa Diaby down that side.

Who could be on their way out?
Villa will need to generate funds and revenue to match Emery’s rapid development. Bertrand Traore is out of contract at the end of the season and an extension is unlikely, but will be unavailable to play over January due to going away with Burkina Faso for the Africa Cup of Nations. Curiously, Traore has not featured since picking up an injury when he was last on international duty yet believes he is ready to play in the tournament.

Meanwhile, Calum Chambers and Leander Dendoncker have struggled for game time and Villa are open to selling both. There are also opportunities for players in Villa’s under-21 setup to head out on loan and experience first-team game time.",False,False,,,,,0.0,1704273667.0,,False,0.0,{},kg3sxvm,False,t3_18osx2r,False,t1_kg3sxvm,True,t1_kg3mvlx,/r/avfc/comments/18osx2r/january_2024_transfer_rumour_thread/kg3sxvm/,,1.0,False,True,False,avfc,t5_2s569,r/avfc,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the article excuse the weird formatting &lt;/p&gt;

2 there is no danger if you pursue only knowdlge, but if you start casting spells there will be if you dont know what you are doing, think of magick as a field of science lets say chemistry, studying theory wont cause harm, but try to implement it and the chemical reaction might burn your hand, magick is the same theory is pretty safe as long as you dont seek it from untrustworty sources, but casting spells can be risky if you dont have clear understanding, while most will fail if you dont know what you are doing, some will succeded, and the chance of casthing the spell wrong are not small, basically theory itself is safe, but using it can be dangerous if you havent fully grasped the theory, like in the field of science, think of the occult as science of the unknown  

3 there is no consequences of studying magick, as long as you dont treat it lightly, while there is some knowdle that might be deemed as dangerous, its not dangerous because it will cause you phisical harm, but because if learned by large amount of people it may cause harm, recently i found some stuff, which lets say, i wouldnt have minded not knowing till i die but it is what it is, just accept it and move on, and before sharing do think of how the information will be taken by others

while the second is the magick of the golden down, you can use the keys inside to invoke angels even if you dont follow the other stuff, but its ultimately your choice, you can also work with angels and other spirits as well, angels are pretty all inclusive in that regard, whether the other spirits will accept thats up to them, anyway if you do decide to work with them first start with 72 angels of magick and only after you got several months proper invocation do you move to the arc angels in the second, summoning arc angels takes a lot of energy, if you however want to communicate with them, you can ask them to appear in your dream, keep in mind ask specific angel for it, the only arcangel which i think you might be able to invoke for now is gabriel, as he is pretty much used to manage other beings, if you invoke him to appear in your dreams to have a chat with you, chances are he will do so, if you have further questions you can reffer them to the angels, 

if you have absolutely no idea how to do it, do the following 1 search icon of gabriel online, make sure the icon wears blue, and has a trumpet or a chalise, loocking at the icon imagine the actual gabriel standing behind the icon listhening to your request, after you have done that, say ""i invoke the arc angel of water, arc angel Gabriel, hear my request and asnwer my call, (appear in my dreams to give me the answers i seek). as you angels have come in piece go in piece, it is done"" you  can alter the text in the the (), just make sure its a proper request",False,False,,,,,0.0,1703782579.0,,False,0.0,{},kfach8t,False,t3_18s5wv1,False,t1_kfach8t,True,t3_18s5wv1,/r/occult/comments/18s5wv1/going_solo_and_need_advice/kfach8t/,,1.0,False,True,False,occult,t5_2qhmc,r/occult,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;same, i started to believe in this when some stuff happened, i have been solo since the beggining, i havent had a teacher or a  community except this sub reddit, i occasionally dm people who seem knowledgeble to ask a question on a topic but that is as far as it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

Miami Heat, constantly in NBA trade rumors, believe they ‘have enough’ to win
MIAMI — Kyle Lowry wore a green Philadelphia Eagles hat Monday night that was so big, if he had stepped out into the warm rain falling outside the Miami Heat’s arena, his clothes would not have taken a drop.

Lowry had earned the freedom to wear such a ridiculous hat, which mushroomed maybe a foot over his forehead and outward to nearly his shoulders. At age 37 and in his 18th NBA season, Lowry is tied for second on the team with 28 games played and is third in total minutes at 819 (out of a possible 1,440).

Also, both his Heat and his Eagles won their Christmas games on Monday, so why not celebrate with a festive, gaudy, felt cap?

As Lowry exited the Heat locker room, he strolled past Tyler Herro, who was about to answer a question about beating the Philadelphia 76ers 119-113 while missing four rotation players, including star Jimmy Butler. Before Herro could get in a word, Lowry bellowed in a deep, voice-over-like voice, as though he was James Earl Jones: “We have enough.”

“Like Kyle said, we do have enough, no matter who’s playing and who’s sitting,” Herro said. “As you’ve seen lately, we’ve been winning games. But in order to (get to) our ultimate goal of winning a championship, we’ll obviously need everybody.”

It’s another typical regular season on South Beach. The Heat followed last season’s NBA Finals berth and gentleman’s sweep by the Denver Nuggets by being a major runner on the NBA’s summer rumor mill. When the wheels stopped turning, the Heat didn’t have Damian Lillard, and even beyond that, two key role players (Gabe Vincent, Max Strus) were gone. And of course, Miami made good on what it did have (the 18th pick of the NBA Draft) and turned it into Jaime Jaquez Jr., who enjoyed one of the best Christmas games ever by a rookie. The Heat are still getting major contributions out of Lowry and Kevin Love, who had been written off in Cleveland in the middle of last season. And Bam Adebayo and Butler remain two of the top players in the league at their positions.

But the NBA is a league in which the attention goes to the super teams, to the rosters with multiple headliners with reigning MVPs and front offices that succeeded in making those big splashes in free agency and with trades (like Boston and Milwaukee in the East, which both upgraded backcourts and in the Celtics’ case also added Kristaps Porziņģis). The Heat added Josh Richardson to their mix, a fine player but not at the level of Lillard, James Harden, Jrue Holiday or Porziņģis.

Miami also has the assets to take a big swing yet with arguably enough first-round picks and intriguing players (like, say, Herro) to make a run at Donovan Mitchell should he be available or at talented players in Chicago or Toronto.

Shams: What I'm hearing about potential trades for Siakam, LaVine and more

But this is always the basic storyline around the Heat. They’re a destination franchise, starving for star power, that happens to end up on the outside when it comes to those major transactions but finds ways to win anyway.

Butler has missed the last three games with a calf strain, and Herro has missed more than a month with a severe ankle sprain. But after beating the Sixers on Christmas, the Heat are 18-12, a half game out of fourth place in the East. They lead the NBA in 3-point percentage despite losing Strus; Adebayo is enjoying arguably his best season; and in limited action, Herro is statistically enjoying his best season.

In 12 games, Herro is averaging 24.0 points (a career high by nearly four points per game) and shooting career bests from the field and 3-point range, and his assists (4.4) also are a career high. But what stands out when watching Herro is that he has been turning his second biggest liability (his first is injuries) into a strength.

In his first four NBA seasons, especially in the playoffs, Herro was the player opponents hunted when they had the ball — he was such a weak defender that game plans forced him into switches and difficult pick-and-rolls.

So far in this campaign, Herro is averaging a career-best 1.3 steals per game, is generally more active in passing lanes and is a bigger contributor to the Heat’s defensive plans. He opened the Christmas game with a chase-down block on Kelly Oubre Jr. and produced a steal in addition to his 22 points.

“He’s reading the game very well,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Herro. “He continues to improve on both sides of the floor, and I think it’s due to him being an ambitious player who wants to impact the game. He wants to impact winning. He wants to be known as a winning player. And the winning players do it on both ends of the court. He’s fully embracing that.”

The Heat’s last two seasons have ended in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals and Game 5 of the NBA Finals, respectively, and in both cases, Herro was injured. They pulled ahead of the Celtics 2-1 in the 2022 East finals when Herro went down with a groin injury. And though he played 7 minutes in the Game 7 loss, he was out the three previous games and ineffective in the deciding game. Last season, he broke his thumb in Game 1 of the first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks and was not seen in another game, though a side story throughout the NBA Finals series with the Nuggets was the possibility that Herro could return.

Herro, 23, is on a four-year, $120 million contract extension that kicked in this season. He was the primary player discussed in the constant Lillard-to-Miami speculation last summer. And given the spectacular rise in defensive performance for Miami in the playoffs with Herro out, it stood to reason that Miami’s path to getting over the top was to turn Herro (and draft capital) either into a more established star or a player who can start and contribute more on defense.

Herro’s apparent defensive improvement potentially changes the calculus.

The Heat haven’t played much this season with a healthy Herro and Butler. Jaquez has been impressive from the outset but is averaging 16.1 points over his last 23 games and, in the short term, has proven to be a capable starter while Butler is injured. Assuming Butler returns early during Miami’s upcoming western trip, Jaquez could continue to see increased minutes because of Caleb Martin’s freshly sprained ankle.

Jaquez scored 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds Monday, becoming the fifth rookie to ever post at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in his first Christmas game and the first to do so in 38 years. For the season, he is averaging 13.7 points per game — fourth among rookies — and the Heat rave about his maturity as a four-year college player at UCLA.

“He has a moxie; he has an experience level that you can feel that it transcends his age,” Spoelstra said. “He just makes winning plays.”",False,False,,,,,0.0,1703697103.0,,False,0.0,{},kf57ynf,True,t3_18s591e,False,t1_kf57ynf,True,t1_kf57c1k,/r/heat/comments/18s591e/the_heat_constantly_in_trade_rumors_believe_they/kf57ynf/,,1.0,False,True,False,heat,t5_2s8tk,r/heat,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami Heat, constantly in NBA trade rumors, believe they ‘have enough’ to win

He opened the Christmas game with a chase-down block on Kelly Oubre Jr. and produced a steal in addition to his 22 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He’s reading the game very well,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Herro. “He continues to improve on both sides of the floor, and I think it’s due to him being an ambitious player who wants to impact the game. He wants to impact winning. He wants to be known as a winning player. And the winning players do it on both ends of the court. He’s fully embracing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heat’s last two seasons have ended in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals and Game 5 of the NBA Finals, respectively, and in both cases, Herro was injured. They pulled ahead of the Celtics 2-1 in the 2022 East finals when Herro went down with a groin injury. And though he played 7 minutes in the Game 7 loss, he was out the three previous games and ineffective in the deciding game. Last season, he broke his thumb in Game 1 of the first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks and was not seen in another game, though a side story throughout the NBA Finals series with the Nuggets was the possibility that Herro could return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herro, 23, is on a four-year, $120 million contract extension that kicked in this season. He was the primary player discussed in the constant Lillard-to-Miami speculation last summer. And given the spectacular rise in defensive performance for Miami in the playoffs with Herro out, it stood to reason that Miami’s path to getting over the top was to turn Herro (and draft capital) either into a more established star or a player who can start and contribute more on defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herro’s apparent defensive improvement potentially changes the calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heat haven’t played much this season with a healthy Herro and Butler. Jaquez has been impressive from the outset but is averaging 16.1 points over his last 23 games and, in the short term, has proven to be a capable starter while Butler is injured. Assuming Butler returns early during Miami’s upcoming western trip, Jaquez could continue to see increased minutes because of Caleb Martin’s freshly sprained ankle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaquez scored 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds Monday, becoming the fifth rookie to ever post at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in his first Christmas game and the first to do so in 38 years. For the season, he is averaging 13.7 points per game — fourth among rookies — and the Heat rave about his maturity as a four-year college player at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He has a moxie; he has an experience level that you can feel that it transcends his age,” Spoelstra said. “He just makes winning plays.”&lt;/p&gt;

—

Basically, the class is having a baking test and all of the students have to prepare something in class. 
Meanwhile, Loid meets with the Handler and is basically told that Operstion Strix is going to be taken over by another spy and it seems that the Forger family is in danger of disbanding. 
Yor’s coworkers are talking about cheating and how there are three signs — sudden change of clothes, extended business trips and sudden presents. Yor doesn’t think much of this but sees Loid talking to Fiona in the distance (literally the distance, Yor has superhuman sight apparently) and she immediately jumps to conclusions. 
Loid gets home and hears about the baking test and thinks it would be a good idea to make the judge’s favorite cake, which is a classic/old cake of a neighboring region (Yor gets paranoid that this is a business trip and that he’s seeing another woman there, but is shocked when she gets invited) and the family goes there to taste it firsthand. They take the train and on the way to the bathroom Anya finds a key to luggage with the chocolate from the commercial and accidentally eats it. 
The bad guys chase Anya, and Anya finds Yor who beats the crap out of them. Forgers arrive to the neighboring country and go to the shop that sells the cake and get the last slice. However, the military bad guy (guy with the beard in the commercial) comes in and literally takes the cake off of their table. Loid challenges him to try and get the cake back, and the challenge is to eat cake and decide what kind sugar is used in each cake and to be as precise as possible. Loid gets it right of course but the bad guy has the answer down to the grams so he technically wins since he’s more precise. 
Loid figures that they can just come back tomorrow but it turns out that the store doesn’t get the ingredients shipped in until Monday and that doesn’t work cause Anya needs to be back at school, so Loid offers to get the ingredients instead. (While at the table Yor noticed that Loid is wearing a turtleneck and he never wears turtlenecks, but it was cold out so Loid thought it would be good to dress appropriately) 
Family goes to the local Christmas market and Loid literally grabs everything in record time and also buys lipstick for Yor as a present. Yor interprets this as the third sign of cheating, smashes a bunch of drinks and gets drunk in attempt to ask Loid about Fiona but ends up passing out. (This is also the scene from the commercial where they’re about to kiss) 
They wait for Yor to wake up (I think around here is when Loid clears up the misunderstanding with Fiona) and head back to the hotel and Loid goes off to find the remaining cherry liquor (which apparently is super rare) by himself and Yor has a blast playing with Anya. Loid can’t find the liquor and heads back to the hotel, says that he’ll go to the neighboring town to get it and be back in the morning and Anya is sad cause she can’t go and wants to go as a family. (This scene is actually really sad) 
Anya goes to the room and Bond has a vision that Anya found the liquor at a nearby shop, so Anya leaves the room from the window with Bond to go get it herself. 
Ofc Loid and Yor are worried as heck so they go searching for her. The military people have a search warrant out for Anya, and when she’s out in town she managed to buy the liquor but gets captured in the process. Bond manages to bite the label/patch thing off of one of the military guys’s arm before getting kicked off and left in the street, where Loid and Yor find him. Loid finds the ripped fabric and immediately understands that Anya got kidnapped. 
He borrows a plane to go save Anya and Yor helps him fuel it up. Initially she was going to wait for him, but thinks it’d be better to do this as a family and runs after the plane before it takes off, literally grabs onto it and sneaks into the storage compartment. 
TLDR for the rest since my thumbs are tired but Loid force lands/crashes the plane on the ship that Anya is being held hostage on, Yor ends up outside but destroys the machine guns shooting at her and breaks in and is faced with a metal enemy who literally can’t get cut, the military guys wait for Anya to poop the microfilm out and Anya meets the poop god, Yor wins and Loid saves Anya but the plane is about to crash so they use family teamwork to keep the ship from crashing into the nearby town and land it in the lake instead. The other spy who as going to take over for Operation Strix ended up getting caught cheating (?) so the Forger family is safe. 
Alls well that ends well and when Anya is in class and announces the cake she’s going to make, Damian says that it’s a commoner’s cake and he’d never eat that and Anya gets teary and says “you don’t wanna eat my cake?” To which Damian blushes lol.

Figures close to Villa say it is a small window into his all-consuming personality, where those in his inner circle describe him as “obsessive” in wanting to extract each possible marginal gain.

In his early days at Villa, Emery would work on at Bodymoor Heath, Villa’s training ground, until as late as 10pm. His close friend, and now the club’s director of football, Damian Vidagany accompanied him and joked how their nocturnal habits would drive security staff, desperately hoping for sleep, to despair. While those hours have now slightly reduced (Emery tends to work 7am-7pm these days, but is prone to staying later to study for the next game) his intensity has not.

Emery’s exhaustive methods meant getting results quickly was important in terms of getting senior players onside. Players subsequently saw purpose in his prolonged preparations and have continued to adhere to his plans. “He’s naturally confident but he loves Emery,” said a source close to one key player. “The coach always asks him never to be afraid to play.”



The first pre-season under Emery this summer was energy-sapping. Lots of travel (including a three-game U.S. tour) with lots of warm-up matches afforded little opportunity for downtime and pushed players, in terms of physical exertion, far more than they experienced in their one pre-season under Gerrard. There were aches and pains before the final friendly away to another of Emery’s former Spanish clubs Valencia but, among players and staff, there remained total buy-in.

Pushing through physical barriers was illustrated once more in Emery opting to go with an unchanged side on Saturday, less than 72 hours after the final whistle against City. “I was thinking about changing the starting XI,” he said, “but yesterday every player said they were perfect to play.”

Emery wanted to build a best-in-class mentality throughout the club. Senior figures involved in non-related footballing matters at Villa say other aspects are having to play catch-up in matching the progress shown under Emery’s leadership. This was also reflected in Villa’s recruitment, where Emery and Vidagany made concerted efforts not to be content with signing “second-rate” players for the sake of it.

In January, Emery’s first window with the club, Villa wanted to give him one new player and sanctioned the Spaniard’s priority target — experienced Real Betis full-back Alex Moreno.

Unai Emery’s side have won 14 consecutive home games, including Wednesday’s remarkable mauling of Manchester City, and in doing so they have turned their stadium into the most formidable ground in English football.

  
The last opponent to win at Aston Villa in the Premier League was Arsenal, all the way back in February. Mikel Arteta’s players triggered the start of Villa’s extraordinary run at home and, as they return to Villa Park this weekend, they do so in the hope of ending it.  
Emery, of course, will have other ideas. 

The question is not, as many observers and pundits have asked in recent months, whether Arsenal should have given Emery more time. Instead it is worth exploring why Emery has been so much more successful at Villa than he was at Arsenal, and what has changed in him since that sorry spell in north London.

The most important shift? Power. Emery neither had it nor wanted it at Arsenal, but he does at Villa. The club’s structure has effectively been rebuilt around the 52-year-old, who has a personal relationship with the owners and key allies in crucial positions.  
It was, for example, striking to see recent images of Emery at an NBA game with co-owner Wes Edens. Emery is able to speak directly to both Edens and Nassef Sawiris, to such an extent that the former chief executive, Christian Purslow, was effectively marginalised before leaving earlier this year.

Emery’s position was strengthened further by the appointment of Monchi as Villa’s president of football operations. Monchi and Emery worked alongside each other earlier in their careers, at Sevilla, and are known to be close. When Monchi was considering Villa’s offer, Emery flew out to Spain to convince him to take the job. “The presence of Unai has been almost the decisive reason to come to Birmingham,” Monchi has said.

  
Even more important to Emery’s success at Villa has been Damian Vidagany. Now the director of football operations, Vidagany is Emery’s right-hand man and the conduit between the first-team and the rest of the club. At Arsenal, there was no Vidagany. Emery’s brother, Igor, was involved but not to the same extent, and certainly not with the same authority that Vidagany holds. Instead of being surrounded by allies, as he is now, Emery found himself in a storm of changing executives and unhelpful power struggles at the Emirates.

He was appointed to work under Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive, but Gazidis left only a few months later. Emery then worked for Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s previous head of football, and alongside Sven Mislintat, the head of recruitment. Mislintat left north London in February 2019, halfway through Emery’s first season. Arsenal then tried and failed to hire Monchi before, later that year, appointing Edu as technical director.  
Clearly, such a chaotic environment was not ideal for a man who was still adjusting to the demands of British football and its culture (his struggle with the English language was a constant problem).

Emery did not exactly help himself at Arsenal, though. He arrived as head coach and was focused entirely on that role. There was never any sense that he wanted to widen his remit, or indeed claim any additional power. If anything, he would shy away from it: publicly and privately, he would often defer any non-coaching issues to those above him. He would not, it is safe to say, have regularly talked directly to the club’s owners.

At Villa, where it is all geared towards Emery, he has a huge say in recruitment. Moussa Diaby was his top target, for example, and it was he who pitched to sign Alex Moreno from Real Betis. In January, the club wanted to sign a new forward — and Emery advised them to be patient and wait for the summer window. They listened to him.

At Arsenal, it was different. Emery had a say, of course, but he was just one voice — and not a particularly influential one. After his first season, he told Arsenal’s executives to sign Wilfried Zaha. Instead, they bought Nicolas Pepe. It simply would not happen at Villa.

From an Arsenal perspective, the Emery era must be seen as a necessary bridge between Arsene Wenger and Arteta. Without Emery’s difficulties in his second season, Arteta would never have been empowered to do what he has done at the Emirates. The squad was such a mess, and the mood at the club was so bad, that Arteta was effectively given permission to bulldoze the place and rebuild it from scratch.

Emery exists in a different world now. A world that has been made for him, and an environment that allows him to do his work in the best way he can. At Arsenal, he was just one cog in a chaotic machine. At Villa, the machine is his machine, and it is currently working more efficiently than anyone could have imagined.",False,False,,,,,0.0,1702033550.0,,False,0.0,{},kchjhxq,True,t3_18dkgqs,False,t1_kchjhxq,True,t3_18dkgqs,/r/soccer/comments/18dkgqs/telegraph_aston_villa_have_given_unai_emery_the/kchjhxq/,,1.0,True,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than nine months have passed since a visiting team travelled to Villa Park in the Premier League and left with three points.

[],False,,FlyByTieDye,,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ncc7,False,False,"Controversial opinion time, but I think Rebirth Superman (at least by Tomasi/Gleason, haven't checked the other books) is B tier. Not to say it's bad, because it's certainly not C, D, E or F tier, but I think it's just okay. And I think, especially after the tumult of the New 52 era (even if I think it's high notes were higher) maybe the fans needed something that was just okay.

I've [spoken about it before](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/s/lHkShvJ8s8), but I think the theming of this era is poorly matched to the characters. It's still all right that it has intentional theming, but I think its themes are a holdover from the Batman and Robin era. There are two major themes I've identified in this run that I will discuss.

The first theme is dysfunctional families. A lot of the opponents they face in the run are really volatile, incompatible families: there's Batman and Robin (and we already know about Talia) in the Trial of the Super Sons arc, there's the Frankenfam being downright abusive to each other, there's the return of the New 52 Clark and Lois, an absence of family, in the Reborn arc, there's Manchester Black's team of mercenary aliens in Black Dawn, there's the Bizarro family, again abusive. Usually foils represent a flaw that the main character(s) share, that the heroes overcome, and the villains succumb to. But I don't think there's ever any evidence of dysfunction, or threat to the cohesiveness of this family at all. The worst we see is Clark slyly fighting crime in the county fair issue, and Jon forgetting to do some chores. This is why I say this theme was a better fit for the Batman and Robin run, as there is serious dysfunction there that you'd hope they might over come: Damian is a murderer, which puts him at odds with Bruce, Bruce is too disciplinarian, which prevents Damian warming up like he had with Grayson, Talia is absent, and incompatible with Bruce, but you still hope there's a chance of togetherness. Meanwhile, this version of the Kents may as well be the gold standard ideal of a family, that the threats they face never seem like a threat within.

The second major theme is the idea of becoming the worst version of yourself. From Eradicator returning, a once possible Superman candidate, now evil and bent on the idea that the Superfam is impure for producing a mixed Jon, to Jon's Black Dawn transformation under Manchester Black, to again New 52 Clark/Lois being an absence of their usual self, to the kind of survivalist versions of themselves they became in Imperius Lex, to finally Boyzarro again. These are all monstrous reflections of our main characters, that is usually good theming, to hold up a dark mirror to your heroes, but like the above, I don't see these as a realistic threat for the Superfam to contend with. It's not like Damian, who always has to live with the fact that he was raised to kill, and has kill, and subtly still believes it's a faster, more effective option to deal with crime (why Nobody worked as a dark mirror), or Bruce, following &gt;!the Death of Damian!&lt; assaulting Jason and dismembering Frankenstein (can't catch a break) under the pretense of &gt;!wanting to bring his son back to life.!&lt; Those characters do become worse versions of themselves that they have to recognise, overcome or repent. But back to Rebirth Superman, it's all external challenges: with Eradicator, that's a definition of family that he is imposing, not a belief that any of the Superfam low key share or might want to challenge themselves on. The Black Dawn transformation was entirely because Manchester Black was forcing black goo on Jon. New 52 Clois were brought back due to Mxy meddling. Boyzarro just grew up in an abusive household. That's why none of them really work as a ""dark mirror"" trope, because they never have to look inside themselves and question if they could truly become that, that there was something inside of themselves to face or let go of. It was always only a matter of avoiding or defeating an external threat, to return to their comfortable lives.

Anyway, this is a lot of effort to put into theming, that's intentional, iterative, and most of everything you'd hope to see in writing, which is why I don't think it's bad or boring. But it's still a B tier for me, because you're always left hoping for that final stretch that would make it all relevant to our characters.",False,False,,,,,0.0,1701726372.0,,False,0.0,{},kc0e0nm,False,t3_18appc3,False,t1_kc0e0nm,True,t3_18appc3,/r/superman/comments/18appc3/superman_eras_discussion_threads_rebirth/kc0e0nm/,,1.0,False,True,False,superman,t5_2qrwe,r/superman,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversial opinion time, but I think Rebirth Superman (at least by Tomasi/Gleason, haven&amp;#39;t checked the other books) is B tier.

[],False,,Appropriate-Barber51,,,,[],,,,text,t2_68l1hgul,False,False,"Firstly, I am so sorry for the hot take I'm about to drop in the actual answer. I respect your opinion and you're allowed to like the characters you like and I'm just glad that you enjoy the show enough to be active and respectful in the fandom. In no way is this post meant to discourage you or any other Millie fan, it's just that I want to fully communicate my opinion in the proper place to do so. 

Now then, I think she kinda deserved the boot? And like... I was a little happy when even though Damian forgave her, he wasn't able to actually convince anyone to keep her in? It kinda felt like karma if I'm being honest? Last season she was forgiven very easily with just one apology, and yes it was only for writing and she had been working to improve in recent episodes as well, but it was still just a very quick apology and it immediately worked on everyone.

I think there's a key difference between her this season and last season. Last season, she was purely there for her research, befriending Priya was just a casual bump along the road. We already saw how she valued her notes more than the friendship at first, with her not voting for Ripper after he used Priya as a human shield so that she could see if he could break the record of the fart. Then throughout the season, she kinda just blindly accepted Priya's help and took her for granted a little, not realizing how she came off to Priya. What I liked was seeing her recognize that and actually work to make up for it, even if it was a bit of a ""Too little too late"" situation for me personally.

This season, she was kinda just at the starting point of ""Not the best friend for Priya"" and ""Here to play... hasn't reviewed the game."" And rather than talk to Priya or actually read the book she still had, she just complained about it and worried about what Priya would say. She acted tough and confident, just to take the easy way slowly, saying that she would score three points... by taking the one point slide three times. Then when things actually got serious, Damian, who was scared the entire time, trusted her to help him face his fears and play the game that she talked. And we all know what happened next. 

The difference this time, is that she's in the ""Play the game"" mindset, knowing how Bowie operates, and trying to prove herself to Priya. Any win is good as long as they win. But what she forgot is that even Priya, who was literally bred for Total Drama, draws the line at using others to succeed. But because everyone got mad at her, she immediately went on the defense and didn't feel remourseful until it was *actually* impacting her socially, even with Priya. Then the second she gets one moment of reassurance from Priya (Who wasn't even mad at her for not reading the book) she was immediately back to making it about her, flip flopping from what a good person she is, to what a bad person she is. 

I'm glad she apologized, even if it felt rushed, and I'm glad Damian forgave her, for the most part, and while I wish she got a few more episodes to see her *actually* make up for it and become a better player herself, I'm glad that there's not an entire season dedicated to it again. If she had sacrificed herself for Damian or even just any other teammate, Priya, Emma, what have you, and had to leave for an injury, then I would've felt like that would be a proper send-off and redemption. As it is now, it just kinda feels like empty karma to keep the cycle from repeating. 

So yeah, with all that being said, sorry for rambling so much, it's just that Millie is one of the weirder characters for me personally and the fandom seems really split on her, so I'm trying to be delicate and thoughtful in my descriptions.

&lt;p&gt;Now then, I think she kinda deserved the boot? And like... I was a little happy when even though Damian forgave her, he wasn&amp;#39;t able to actually convince anyone to keep her in? It kinda felt like karma if I&amp;#39;m being honest? Last season she was forgiven very easily with just one apology, and yes it was only for writing and she had been working to improve in recent episodes as well, but it was still just a very quick apology and it immediately worked on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a key difference between her this season and last season. Last season, she was purely there for her research, befriending Priya was just a casual bump along the road. We already saw how she valued her notes more than the friendship at first, with her not voting for Ripper after he used Priya as a human shield so that she could see if he could break the record of the fart. Then throughout the season, she kinda just blindly accepted Priya&amp;#39;s help and took her for granted a little, not realizing how she came off to Priya. What I liked was seeing her recognize that and actually work to make up for it, even if it was a bit of a &amp;quot;Too little too late&amp;quot; situation for me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This season, she was kinda just at the starting point of &amp;quot;Not the best friend for Priya&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Here to play... hasn&amp;#39;t reviewed the game.&amp;quot; And rather than talk to Priya or actually read the book she still had, she just complained about it and worried about what Priya would say. She acted tough and confident, just to take the easy way slowly, saying that she would score three points... by taking the one point slide three times. Then when things actually got serious, Damian, who was scared the entire time, trusted her to help him face his fears and play the game that she talked. And we all know what happened next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference this time, is that she&amp;#39;s in the &amp;quot;Play the game&amp;quot; mindset, knowing how Bowie operates, and trying to prove herself to Priya. Any win is good as long as they win. But what she forgot is that even Priya, who was literally bred for Total Drama, draws the line at using others to succeed. But because everyone got mad at her, she immediately went on the defense and didn&amp;#39;t feel remourseful until it was &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; impacting her socially, even with Priya. Then the second she gets one moment of reassurance from Priya (Who wasn&amp;#39;t even mad at her for not reading the book) she was immediately back to making it about her, flip flopping from what a good person she is, to what a bad person she is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad she apologized, even if it felt rushed, and I&amp;#39;m glad Damian forgave her, for the most part, and while I wish she got a few more episodes to see her &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; make up for it and become a better player herself, I&amp;#39;m glad that there&amp;#39;s not an entire season dedicated to it again. If she had sacrificed herself for Damian or even just any other teammate, Priya, Emma, what have you, and had to leave for an injury, then I would&amp;#39;ve felt like that would be a proper send-off and redemption. As it is now, it just kinda feels like empty karma to keep the cycle from repeating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, with all that being said, sorry for rambling so much, it&amp;#39;s just that Millie is one of the weirder characters for me personally and the fandom seems really split on her, so I&amp;#39;m trying to be delicate and thoughtful in my descriptions. I&amp;#39;m sorry if anything I said potentially upset you or any of the Millie fans out there, I simply just wanted to explain my logic and analysis. Thank you for taking the time to read this comment and I hope you have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;

‘Basically zero’ for labour market
While business groups are keen on maintaining high levels of migration to fill job vacancies, Coates says migrants create as many jobs as they take.
“The net impact of migration on the labour market is basically zero. Migrants create as many shortages as they solve because, while they might fill a shortage in a particular asset to the economy, they are also adding to demand by their spending on a whole range of goods and services across the rest of the economy.”
The main benefit of running a migration program is that Australia gains access to scarce human capital that’s expensive to train locally.

Tech Council of Australia chief executive Kate Pounder. Oscar Colman
“That is, by far, the biggest benefit that we get from the migration program, and both our temporary and permanent programs should be designed in a way to maximise the amount of skilled talent that we get,” Coates says.
In any case, business has welcomed the influx of migrants as vital to filling large numbers of job openings.
Tech Council of Australia chief executive Kate Pounder told The Australian Financial Review this week that federal Labor’s 1.2 million tech jobs target by 2030 meant an additional 43,000 skilled migrants per year were needed above current rates of 119,000 per year.
“It’s high-wage, high-skill, globally in-demand people in critical jobs across the economy,” she says. “In practice, we’re talking about a few thousand people per year who will qualify under those conditions.”
The comments were echoed by leaders in a range of key industries, including health, engineering, housing construction and medicine.

Engineers Australia group executive Damian Ogden warns that by 2040, Australia is expected to have a shortage of 200,000 engineers, potentially undermining infrastructure and construction projects and sapping economic growth.
“Australia continues to face an engineering skills challenge. The engineering workforce is highly reliant on skilled migration, with 62 per cent of the profession [in Australia] born overseas,” he says.
“We need to consider how we manage the pipeline of engineers in Australia more effectively to ensure we strike the right balance of migrant engineers to meet the demand, while also developing our talent locally.”
Are caps the solution?
While some observers have called for Labor to cap migration, Sydney University migration expert Anna Boucher says it is easier said than done, and some aspects of Australia’s migration program cannot be easily controlled.

“Inherent in the notion that we can control [net overseas migration] is the idea that we can control all migration,” she says.
While the permanent program has an annual cap of 190,000, Australia’s temporary migration program – including student visas – is largely demand-driven.
“If we’re going to say we are setting the [net overseas migration] every year, the government is going to need a lot more control of aspects of the immigration program than they do at present,” she says.
“And that brings with it a whole other array of costs for the economy and other policy settings. The higher education industry is not going to be very happy about that.”

Boucher says the obsessive focus on net overseas migration can become radicalised and fails to deal with the nuances of Australia’s migration program.
The tax take
Alan Gamlen, director of the Migration Hub at the Australian National University, wrote this week that only about 3 per cent of the global population live outside their country of birth. The percentage has remained steady since the 1960s, after a period of volatile movement after World War II.
Considering a new book by expert Hein de Haas, professor of sociology at the University of Amsterdam, Gamlen notes migrants do essential work that locals can’t or won’t, spanning low-wage jobs in agriculture or domestic care, and high-wage positions in science, medicine and trades, where demand outstrips locally trained supply.
Since January 2022, more than 27,000 internationally trained medical practitioners have been registered to work in Australia. Before the pandemic, about 18 per cent of all registered nurses and 32 per cent of medical practitioners were trained overseas.
“Migrants earning high wages pay more in taxes than others receive in government benefits,” Gamlen writes. “For instance, in Australia, the average skilled migrant pays $127,000 more tax over their lifetime than does the average resident.”
The peak will start to diminish as about 120,000 special 408 COVID visas expire over the next six to 12 months. At the same time, there has been an 80 per cent decline in the number of state-issued skilled and regional visas for the 2023-24 financial year.
Minton tells AFR Weekend that there’s been a shift in the past two or three months, after cost-cutting in accounting firms and the big four consulting businesses.
“I’ve spoken to recruiters who have worked in this market for 10 years, and this is the worst they’ve seen it,” he says.
“Post-COVID, there hasn’t been too many ebbs and flows, it has been really consistent. But now some companies are letting people go, or not taking on new people. Migrants are looking elsewhere or taking casual work and short-term contracts.

“Honestly, 12 months ago, people could have a job within a week of arriving, but that’s not the case now.”
Minton is preparing for more disruption in the market, but is optimistic that demand for overseas-trained accountants will pick up again in 2024.
“I think it will be a few months at least before everyone gets a sense of where the economy is going and what things look like and whether we are going into recession or not,” he says.

We meet a few of the members of the Choir and they are exclusively on the younger side, so probably in their twenties. As we know, the Choir is an organization within the church, made out up of orphans who were molded by older church members but eventually outgrew them and took over the whole thing, now being opposed only by Mesis. With that fact we get a period of about twenty years from the beginning of the Choir to the events of the game.

Of course we can't really know at which point the church started taking in Orphans, so this twenty year period could only be the tip of the iceberg, but luckily we have Micolash. He's old, but definitely not as old as Gehrman, so one or two generations before the choir. Mist importantly, he was at Byrgenwerth and given he left together with Laurence when he was a young adult, that narrows the age of the church to a maximum of around 40 years, if you want to have it as long as possible. The real age is probably a bit less than that, around 30 years I'd say.

And Melinda will order Yor and Garden to off both of them as well, since I believe Melinda is the true brains of the shadow government.

\&gt; Damian is a quarter Asian and a Quarter Arabic  
Sure, but he is often drawn as white as the rest of the Bats, and his Asian/Arabic heritage has never been a key trait of him.

I mean, I appreciate that she wasn't, like, Ganesh Girl the Magic Hindi Fakir or something, and in all honesty she was my favourite character of the team (It helps that her redesign, despite being super edgy, was quite cool looking), and I wouldn't complain if it wasn't because you can't tell she's from India outside of her name.

\&gt; I don't think there was a remarkable change at this point in time in publication standards

Oh sure, Starfire was Ms. Fanservice (Her learning through kissing is still something I dislike), but she had... you know... Other things. In Red Hood she served two purposes: Shoot pink beams from her hands and shove her triple H chest on your face. It doens't help that before that, she was sexualised but she looked human (Or as human as superheroine physiques can be) while here she looks lifeless. There's also the fact that she engages in casual sex with everyone constantly and has the memory of a goldfish which is... uncomfortable.

Catwoman was sexualised, sure (Hell, I love Grant Morrison and their run on Batman Inc almost opens on her wearing panties, knee high boots and a tank top), but here it's not only sexualised, it's fetishised. We first see her boobs and ass before we get to see her face (While also seeing her boobs) and on she spends more time on her comic book in her underwear than in her costume. They also ereased her complicated history with Bruce, so instead of a nononsense vigilante and an adrenaline junkie slowly growing to care and trust each other became sex on a rooftop with a stranger. 

Besides, I'd say some previously non-sexualised heroines, like Wonder Woman or Katana, suddenly became hotter and sexier. Diana was gorgeous, yeah, but aside of showing some cleavage and leg, her outfit was pretty sensible. The New 52 version shows a *lot* more chest and appears naked a lot more too.

Ok buddy, imma stop you right there. Dagger Type's reveal was criticised because they lean on all the ""creepy crossdresser"" tropes and they were a mentally unstable psycho. It's like calling Caligula positive LGBT representation. 

\&gt; I'm reminded of Milestone that dealt originally with underage sex, pregnancy, drugs and gangs and a lot of white readers felt it was racist and problematic

Milestone should be hailed as a national treasure and Dwayne McDuffie's corpse should be preserved on the Moon. It's some of the best social critique I've ever read: Poignant, daring, relevant, complex... All the while never stopping being fun and exciting. White people complaining about it being ""problematic"" is like saying that ""12 years a slave"" is racist because every african american that appears is a slave. It handled those topics with extreme maturity, respect and care, and most modern comics can only hope to be at best a fraction of Milestone on a bad day. This has nothing to do with the critique, I just wanted to praise Milestone Comics. 

Shame New 52's Static was massive shit.

[Crash Landing: The Inside Scoop About How Covid and Affirmative Action Policy Gutted Aviation Safety](https://revolver.news/2023/11/crash-landing-the-inside-scoop-about-how-covid-and-affirmative-action-policy-gutted-aviation-safety/)

&gt;Two private planes collided on the runway of a Houston airport early last week. Luckily, no one was seriously injured, and the ultimate nightmare scenario of a midair collision did not transpire. Investigators are still looking into the incident, though early reports suggest the air traffic controllers were responsible.

&gt;The recent accident in Houston is just the latest noteworthy instance in what a major New York Times investigation this summer determined to be “an alarming pattern of safety lapses and near misses in the skies and on the runways in the USA.” According to internal records of the Federal Aviation Agency, the Times reported that these safety lapses and near misses occurred as a “result of human error.” The Times report further revealed that “runway incursions” of the sort described above have nearly doubled, from 987 to 1732, despite the widespread proliferation of advanced technologies.

&gt;One such incident involved an air traffic controller clearing a FedEx cargo plane to land on a runway just as a Southwest Airlines jet was set to take off on the same runway. The air traffic controller in question said the Southwest jet would take off before the FedEx plane got too close, though the two planes ended up just seconds from colliding, with the FedEx plane skimming less than 100 feet over the Southwest jet, whose 128 passengers had no clue how narrowly they just escaped death.

&gt;...

&gt;Despite the remarkable lack of transparency with respect to such near misses and the air traffic controllers behind them, the Times was able to identify the controller behind this incident as one Damian Campbell, a “Navy veteran and self-published poet.” According to the report, even fellow air traffic controllers were “baffled” by Campbell’s actions. Still more baffling is the fact that Campbell is apparently back on the job. FAA’s policy is not to take disciplinary action against a controller unless he or she is guilty of “gross negligence” or illegal activity.

&gt;The Times report does not provide a picture of Mr. Campbell. Such is the extreme reluctance to show an image of Mr. Campbell that the only reference we could find is from a Twitter user who posted a screenshot of the L1nkedIn profile of one Damian Campbell who works as an air traffic controller in Austin, Texas. The L1nkedIn link has since been scrubbed:

&gt;One special outgrowth of the diversity regime is the legal doctrine of “disparate impact,” according to which any employment vetting metric (like a standardized test) is presumptively discriminatory and illegal, irrespective of intent, if some races perform worse than others, leading to a “disparate impact” in terms of which races are hired for which jobs.

&gt;In aviation, the effects of these developments are obvious and account for a great deal of the decline in Air Traffic Control quality. We can trace this decline directly to new hiring policies implemented by the Obama administration. In 2012, three years before Obama put policies to increase diversity in air traffic control into effect, the FAA released an unclassified report titled, “Development, Validation, and Fairness of Biographical Data Questionnaire for the Air Traffic Control Specialist Occupation.” The report explicitly recommends the use of biographical data, or “biodata”—personal  information about applicants—in place of the blind method of measuring competency to promote racial equality.

If everyone was allowed reacted to his cruelty appropriately, it wouldn’t be as terrible to deal with. Could make a great journey for introspection and character growth but that’s not what this is.

Having writers that care about the characters and their project makes a huge difference, and can really elevate the unique and collaborative nature of comics that fans love so much, but it’s jarring that they allow such shoddy writing to thrive like this. It also feels like they’re being ridiculously rushed and their poor planning and some of the poor writing is some of it. Like they were made clear of the endgame, but they weren’t given much time to make the journey to it make sense.

I’m also getting Comic news from Tumblr, and there have thankfully been some people who named writers who wrote Selina respectfully after this nightmare, I just can’t recall any names.

There are SO many good reasons to make the family split, because again, Bruce is an asshole who keeps screwing them over. They were plenty of reasons to drive a wedge with or without Selina, but they are genuinely so pathologically terrified of ever letting Bruce take the fall for his own legitimate failings. Seriously, what’s up with that? It’s genuinely creepy and patronizing. Would someone be blacklisted from the industry if they made his fuckups matter so much? Someone is definitely taking Batman WAY too personally to not allow any comic to criticize him, Christ. Maybe the horrible behavior is an editorial’s power-fantasy or something.

Hopefully someone writes Jason having a better time in a Elseworld comic or something. Give this man a break.

Knight Terrors was the name, thank you!

I remember hearing there was a big writer that hated Dick, but I didn’t realize that led to Stephanie’s cruel run as Robin. They’re also why she’s not considered an official Robin either, right? People have been talking about Stephanie deserving to be the Red Hood equivalent in a “Reverse Robins” scenario (where the order and often age of the Robins are switched around), because of how awful and disrespectfully she had been treated at the time - she’d deserved to be mad about it.

Genuinely one of the most baffling and irresponsible ways to handle a fictional universe. Crisis matter and stories stay in the minds of fans because of good world-building and character growth. The fact that they can’t pretend to care about that is insane. 
What’s “Tec” mean in this context? I’m not familiar with what that could mean. Isn’t he also supposed to be living in a penthouse with Damian in another run, a run where Damian writes comics based on his own life? People were concerned how that was supposed to work out because Gotham Wars is meant to take place before that run despite them being published at the same time and Bruce low-key abandoned Damian or something. Bruce is also supposed to be missing a hand an none of the art seems to remember that either. It’s such a mess, good god.

Realizing that Bruce is somehow family to the super cool Robins and friends with characters like Superman on a good day is what finally made him seem worthwhile to me. Batman on his own is someone I can’t bring myself to care about, but the man these Birds and Boy Scout value so much might not be so bad - when he’s given a writer that remembers he’s supposed to care about people, at least. 

I haven’t heard much about Wonder Woman in years, but the recent Superman controversy seems to have more to do with the issues around aging up Jon (his relationship with Damian sounds FASCINATING and we were truly robbed of seeing them grow up together) and the weird decisions around the newer Kon stuff. At least being aggressively mediocre can be seen as a mercy from the more violent character assassination the Bats are facing, maybe?

Denny O’Neil sounds like an awesome guy. Matches Malone, the Al Ghuls, and Arkham were all _him?_ That legacy is iconic as hell, holy shit. I don’t hear much about Dick’s time as a student, but I really appreciate hearing someone really put effort into that! I’ll definitely look forward to Friedrick’s work, thank you!

&lt;p&gt;Having writers that care about the characters and their project makes a huge difference, and can really elevate the unique and collaborative nature of comics that fans love so much, but it’s jarring that they allow such shoddy writing to thrive like this. It also feels like they’re being ridiculously rushed and their poor planning and some of the poor writing is some of it. Like they were made clear of the endgame, but they weren’t given much time to make the journey to it make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also getting Comic news from Tumblr, and there have thankfully been some people who named writers who wrote Selina respectfully after this nightmare, I just can’t recall any names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are SO many good reasons to make the family split, because again, Bruce is an asshole who keeps screwing them over. They were plenty of reasons to drive a wedge with or without Selina, but they are genuinely so pathologically terrified of ever letting Bruce take the fall for his own legitimate failings. Seriously, what’s up with that? It’s genuinely creepy and patronizing. Would someone be blacklisted from the industry if they made his fuckups matter so much? Someone is definitely taking Batman WAY too personally to not allow any comic to criticize him, Christ. Maybe the horrible behavior is an editorial’s power-fantasy or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully someone writes Jason having a better time in a Elseworld comic or something. Give this man a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knight Terrors was the name, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing there was a big writer that hated Dick, but I didn’t realize that led to Stephanie’s cruel run as Robin. They’re also why she’s not considered an official Robin either, right? People have been talking about Stephanie deserving to be the Red Hood equivalent in a “Reverse Robins” scenario (where the order and often age of the Robins are switched around), because of how awful and disrespectfully she had been treated at the time - she’d deserved to be mad about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuinely one of the most baffling and irresponsible ways to handle a fictional universe. Crisis matter and stories stay in the minds of fans because of good world-building and character growth. The fact that they can’t pretend to care about that is insane. 
What’s “Tec” mean in this context? I’m not familiar with what that could mean. Isn’t he also supposed to be living in a penthouse with Damian in another run, a run where Damian writes comics based on his own life? People were concerned how that was supposed to work out because Gotham Wars is meant to take place before that run despite them being published at the same time and Bruce low-key abandoned Damian or something. Bruce is also supposed to be missing a hand an none of the art seems to remember that either. It’s such a mess, good god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing that Bruce is somehow family to the super cool Robins and friends with characters like Superman on a good day is what finally made him seem worthwhile to me. Batman on his own is someone I can’t bring myself to care about, but the man these Birds and Boy Scout value so much might not be so bad - when he’s given a writer that remembers he’s supposed to care about people, at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t heard much about Wonder Woman in years, but the recent Superman controversy seems to have more to do with the issues around aging up Jon (his relationship with Damian sounds FASCINATING and we were truly robbed of seeing them grow up together) and the weird decisions around the newer Kon stuff. At least being aggressively mediocre can be seen as a mercy from the more violent character assassination the Bats are facing, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denny O’Neil sounds like an awesome guy. Matches Malone, the Al Ghuls, and Arkham were all &lt;em&gt;him?&lt;/em&gt; That legacy is iconic as hell, holy shit. I don’t hear much about Dick’s time as a student, but I really appreciate hearing someone really put effort into that! I’ll definitely look forward to Friedrick’s work, thank you! They both sound so great! 😁&lt;/p&gt;

“No, I mean it. These silly mortals with their ‘Halloween’ nonsense have given me the perfect feeding ground!” The demon held his arms out and the candles flared.   
  
“I’m not falling for that again,” Regan spat out with a smirk. “Last guy already had me fearing for my life.”  
  
The demon sighed. “Oh, Jason has got to stop spoiling my meals with that toy machete.” He slowly facepalmed–clearly this was an ongoing feud.  
  
Regan frowned and started. “Wait, his name really is Jason?”  
  
The demon shrugged noncommittally. “What can I say, we like playing to our parts. I’m Damian.”  
  
“Of course you are.”  
  
“Enough pleasantries,” Damian said with a chuckle. He stepped towards her–Regan mirrored his movements, circling around. “Oh come now dear, surely you don’t expect to get out of here without some form of payment?”  
  
“You’re not getting my soul.”  
  
“Am I not?” Damian cackled. Then he reached into his pocket–and held out an ornate golden key. “You may have outsmarted Deep and Wide in the last room, but getting this key from me is going to be a bit trickier than a fancy pirouette.”   
  
“Assemble,” Regan corrected.  
  
“Whatever.”  
  
Barely able to stop herself from making a crack about a children’s movie, Regan stood straight. “Alright, so that key will get me back to the entrance without having to take Coward’s Way.”  
  
“That’s right.”  
  
“And what am I going to have to do to get it?”  
  
“Well…” Damian crossed his arms and considered theatrically. “I can’t very well force you to blow me off, you’d bite me off.”  
  
“Damn right.”  
  
“Hmhm, well then…how about an orgasm? For you, that is.”  
  
Regan froze. “I…what?”  
  
Damian held his hands up. “What, you expected me to demand to bullwhip you or something? Nono, seeing your pretty little face contorted with humiliated pleasure is plenty of sport for me for one guest.”  
  
Sport. Regan felt herself flushing deeply, which clearly amused Damian even more. “I won’t even demand clothing. You’re going to have to ask him for your bra back, you know.”  
  
She gritted her teeth. “I’ll deal with Jason later! Fine, where do you want me.” She intentionally left the lilt out of the end of the word–she wanted this to sound as little like a question, like permission, as possible.  
  
Damian raised his eyebrows. “Why…there, of course.” He pointed to the altar. “Just, lean against it for me, my dear.”  
  
“You’re sick,” Regan muttered as she walked past him. Dutifully she squared her hips and leaned forward slightly, elbows locked. She heard him chuckle and walk behind her, feeling his warmth. He reached over and pressed a button–the front of the pulpit slid open, revealing a mirror! Regan stared at her reflection, dumbstruck.  
  
“Mmm, weren't expecting to have to watch, were you?” Damian teased. He leaned behind her, putting his face next to hers. Then he leaned in and whispered, “do you remember the safeword?”  
  
The question jolted her a little bit. Again, here in the middle of all of this pageantry, these ridiculous sex-themed theatrics, was a ray of light, a caring word from would otherwise be classed as a tormentor. Safety, kindness. She blushed furiously and nodded, calling the word back to her mind just to be sure.  
  
But she didn’t say it.   
  
Damian chuckled low. “Good. Now get ready…three…two…”  
  
The vibration against her clothed womanhood was its own special kind of jumpscare. Regan squeaked, much to Damian’s amusement. She leapt a little too, but settled back down against the thick egg-shape that Damian was holding against her. “There we go. How does that feel, Princess? You like that? Yeah you do,” Damian teased. “Is your mind going blank already? Fuzzing over with arousal?”  
  
Regan saw herself nod in the mirror, but it seemed far away. All night she’d been trying to quell the fire inside, trying to figure out why the theatrics and taunting were turning her on. Now she knew–she’d known the second Damian had told her that her orgasm would be humiliating. The taunts, the showmanship, the fear…was deliciously humiliating. It was all in her mind, everything was about her mind being manipulated in a safe environment.  
  
Regan had a new kink.   
  
“You look ridiculous, leaning against a cardboard altar for a man in face paint…how hard did you scream when the zombies grabbed you, mm? Did your eyes pop out of your head when you saw Jason’s fake blade? Oop–”  
  
Regan couldn’t hear him. It was a funny sort of feeling, feeling like your ears had been whited out with the force of an orgasm. She could see, her own face looking particularly stupid was plain as day to her as her lower body rocked with pleasure, but audibly it was like nothing was there. The orgasm took all of her focus, every ounce of her ability to pay attention to anything was all focused on that beautiful, agonizing contraction that was spreading through her entire body. And then she stopped being able to see, too.  
  
  
—  
  
When she came to her senses she was sitting in the front pew, a bottle of water in her hand and the key next to her. Damian was nowhere to be seen–she must have blacked out briefly. Regan grabbed the bottle of water and sucked half of it down without thinking, her free hand wrapping around the golden key.   
  
She gave herself a few minutes to recover before standing–her muscles obeyed her without complaint, which was more than she’d been expecting. Regan easily found two doors behind the pulpit–one that said “Coward’s Way” and had no door, and the other that said “Freedom”. The key fit perfectly into the door and Regan stepped through.  
  
A short winding trip down a plain hallway later and Regan stepped back into the initial foyer with orange rugs and tacky decorations. Butler was standing there–and so were Damian, Jason, and a few men in zombie outfits. They were leaning against the counter and chatting, facing her door.   
  
Waiting for her to emerge.  
  
Without a word Regan marched over to Jason and held a hand out. He laughed, unslinging her bra from his shoulder where he’d still had it, handing it to her. “Thank you,” she said with sarcasm she didn’t try to contain.  
“You’re quite welcome,” he replied in the same tone of voice.  
  
“I do hope you enjoyed yourself,” Regan was surprised to learn that Damian’s accent had not been affected, or he was still affecting it now.   
  
“No comment.”  
  
Laughter from the entire group.  
  
“Alright alright,” Butler said after a minute. “Regan, wasn’t it? Alright dear, do you have any questions, anything you’d like to say to us before you go?” Jason held both hands in front of his face as if he expected to be slapped, prompting more laughter.  
  
Regan stared at these men. She’d known them for a very short time, but she had a lot of questions. About herself, about what she’d experienced…and they were the best people to answer them. It was getting late and she couldn’t stick around much longer…so there was really only one thing for it.  
  
“Yeah…uh…about this ‘club’ of yours…”

Regan easily found two doors behind the pulpit–one that said “Coward’s Way” and had no door, and the other that said “Freedom”. The key fit perfectly into the door and Regan stepped through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short winding trip down a plain hallway later and Regan stepped back into the initial foyer with orange rugs and tacky decorations. Butler was standing there–and so were Damian, Jason, and a few men in zombie outfits. They were leaning against the counter and chatting, facing her door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting for her to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a word Regan marched over to Jason and held a hand out. He laughed, unslinging her bra from his shoulder where he’d still had it, handing it to her. “Thank you,” she said with sarcasm she didn’t try to contain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re quite welcome,” he replied in the same tone of voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do hope you enjoyed yourself,” Regan was surprised to learn that Damian’s accent had not been affected, or he was still affecting it now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No comment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughter from the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright alright,” Butler said after a minute. “Regan, wasn’t it? Alright dear, do you have any questions, anything you’d like to say to us before you go?” Jason held both hands in front of his face as if he expected to be slapped, prompting more laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regan stared at these men. She’d known them for a very short time, but she had a lot of questions. About herself, about what she’d experienced…and they were the best people to answer them. It was getting late and she couldn’t stick around much longer…so there was really only one thing for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah…uh…about this ‘club’ of yours…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE END&lt;/p&gt;

How the Bucks moved in silence to land Damian Lillard and what it means for Giannis Antetokounmpo
Where was everybody?

It was late September inside the Milwaukee Bucks’ offices that sit across the street from Fiserv Forum, and the team’s basketball operations brain trust — from general manager Jon Horst on down — was nowhere to be found.

This was not normal.

Had they taken unexpected vacations? Was there a company retreat that the employees who were left behind, and who had certainly noticed the three-day absence of the team’s front office core, weren’t invited to? It was all so confusing.

Then came the stunning news that solved the intra-office mystery: The Bucks had landed Damian Lillard from Portland in a three-team deal that sent Jrue Holiday, an unprotected 2029 first-round pick and two pick swaps to Portland and Grayson Allen to Phoenix.

For the second time in less than three years, with uncertainty about Giannis Antetokounmpo and his long-term future in Milwaukee looming and the two-time MVP appearing to apply pressure through various media channels in the month before the deal, Horst responded by pulling off the kind of gutsy, blockbuster trade that relieved the pressure that comes with employing a superstar. And he did it while turning the team’s locker room into a temporary headquarters during those crucial final three days that led to the deal.

Secrecy is paramount when it comes to moves of this magnitude. One stray piece of information, or an ill-timed media leak, can change the state of negotiations or perhaps kill a trade entirely. If there is no deal to be done, then it’s vital to keep the details of those discussions private to protect the spirit of the players discussed and, by proxy, the group. In this case, where the Bucks already had a roster they still believed to be legitimate title contenders, that meant keeping the Holiday part of the discussion with the Trail Blazers under wraps.

For the 40-year-old Horst, who joined the Bucks’ basketball operations group in his mid-20s and was elevated to GM in 2017, this sort of temporary office relocation was one of the many ways he has learned to be discreet. Even Antetokounmpo, who had made the Bucks faithful so nervous when he spoke openly about the prospect of leaving Milwaukee with the New York Times and on the “48 minutes” podcast, didn’t know that the trade was in the works.

“No idea,” Antetokounmpo told The Athletic recently. “No idea. But I understand why, because Jrue Holiday is my guy. And I don’t want (to be part of that process). I don’t do this.

“I was lifting weights (at the practice facility) with the strength and conditioning coach (Suki Hobson), and Suki said, ‘Oh!’ (as she looked at the news on her phone). And I said, ‘What’s going on?’ And then she showed me.”

When it comes to Antetokounmpo’s influence within the organization, he decided years ago to steer clear of the moves that involve someone being sent away, i.e. firings and trades. That doesn’t mean his viewpoints aren’t known internally, of course, as is the case with any superstar. And as was the case in the coaching search process that led to the hiring of Adrian Griffin last summer — when Antetokounmpo endorsed the move after taking part in a Bucks dinner to discuss the possible hiring — he’s willing to be more intimately involved when the key decision being made doesn’t result in anyone’s exit.

But his trust in Horst, who was part of the John Hammond-led front office that drafted Antetokounmpo as an 18-year-old in 2013, runs deep.

“I’ve said many times that I don’t want to be aware of things that affect people’s lives,” Antetokounmpo said. “At the end of the day, if you trade somebody it affects his life, or if you fire somebody, it affects his life. For me, I cannot be a part of that. And I want to stay away. From the early years, 2016, 2017, with the first conversations, (Bucks officials would) say, ‘Giannis, what do you think about this?’ (He’d say), ‘Guys, I’m going to take a step back in this. What I want to know is that we always have a chance to win. I trust you guys, and you guys are going to do that. And I think Jon has done a great job doing that for years now.”

GO DEEPER

Inside the Damian Lillard trade to Milwaukee and how it came together

So why, then, did it seem as Antetokounmpo was so skeptical of the Bucks’ willingness to go all in when he did those two summertime interviews? Was it part of a plan to compel the Bucks front office to make a big move such as the Lillard trade this summer, or perhaps a way of nudging them to give Holiday an extension that seemed to be in question as the All-Star guard approached possible free agency next summer? To hear Antetokounmpo tell it, it was none of the above.

“No. Zero. None of those things,” Antetokounmpo said emphatically during our post-practice discussion. “It was organic. I didn’t have a strategy. Nothing. (That message) is something that I always — every year — say. I can go back and find five articles of me saying this since I was 22 years old, you know?

“The New York Times piece was not about basketball. It was a business piece, and (the reporter), like everybody else, cut to the chase and asked me a basketball question and I said what I always say. And the podcast, I went on this podcast because the (host, former Bucks assistant coach Ross Geiger) is my friend. He’s a guy who, when I came into the league and I was 18 and nobody was talking to me, he took care of me. I slept on his couch. He helped me when I got groceries. He allowed me to drive his car because I didn’t have a driver’s license. I only had (a permit), where I took a test and I could drive with somebody in the car. So he was always that guy in the car. We’d go and get food. He. took me to the game, took me to the practice every day, so it was the least I could do.”

From Horst’s vantage point, there was nothing new to be learned by way of Antetokounmpo’s media tour. The 28-year-old was merely saying publicly what had been known within the Bucks privately for so long now. This is the welcome reality of having one of the game’s greats on your roster.

Still, Horst admits that it played a small part in his level of urgency with the roster.

“I think it’s probably too dismissive to say that (Antetokounmpo’s comments) didn’t factor in at all,” Horst told The Athletic. “That’s probably not honest and sincere, because I care about everything that our players say and I try to assess it and evaluate it and understand it. But (the part it played) is just a little bit above ‘not at all.’ It’s not much above ‘Not at all.’ And the reason is that it’s not new.",False,False,,,,,0.0,1698091322.0,,False,0.0,{},k65gkld,False,t3_17erxio,False,t1_k65gkld,True,t1_k6591rc,/r/MkeBucks/comments/17erxio/the_lillard_welcome_parade_in_milwaukee_that_took/k65gkld/,,1.0,False,True,False,MkeBucks,t5_2t10o,r/MkeBucks,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the Bucks moved in silence to land Damian Lillard and what it means for Giannis Antetokounmpo

**The Highest Scoring Games In NBA History**  
An NBA player has scored 70 or more points in a game only 13 times over nearly eight decades. In the 2022-2023 season it has now happened twice in the last two months.  
Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers scored 71 points during a 131-114 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday, equaling the eighth-highest scoring game in NBA history. Lillard matched the total scored just 55 days prior by Donovan Mitchell, who set a Cleveland Cavaliers’ record with 71 points. Mitchell’s scoring feat was the most points scored by any player in 17 years, and the Cavaliers rallied from 21 down to beat the Chicago Bulls 145-134 in overtime.  
This marked the first time in the same season that two different NBA players have scored 70-plus points in a single game. The key word being DIFFERENT players. Wilt Chamberlain scored 70-plus points in a game twice over a 13-day span in 1962.  
**1. Wilt Chamberlain, 100 points - March 2, 1962**  
Chamberlain shot 36-for-63 from the field, setting the record for most shots made and attempted in a single game, and went 28-for-32 from the free throw line in the Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147 win over the New York Knicks.  
**2. Kobe Bryant, 81 points - Jan. 22, 2006**  
Bryant shot 28-for-46 from the field, including 7 of 13 from three, and went 18-for-20 from the free throw line, in the Los Angeles Lakers' 122-104 win over the Toronto Raptors.  
**3. Wilt Chamberlain, 78 points - Dec. 8, 1961**  
Chamberlain shot 31-for-62 and went 16 of 31 from the stripe to top the single-game scoring record of 71 points held by Elgin Baylor of the Lakers. Chamberlain also grabbed 43 rebounds in the Philadelphia Warriors' 151-147 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.  
**4. (Tie) David Thompson, 73 points - April 9, 1978**  
Thompson went 28 of 38 from the field and 17 of 20 from the line for what at the time was only the NBA's second non-Chamberlain 70-plus point game. Thompson, of the Denver Nuggets, got the total green light during a 139-137 loss to the Detroit Pistons in the final game of the regular season.  
4. (Tie) Wilt Chamberlain, 73 points - Nov. 16, 1962 and Jan. 13, 1962  
Chamberlain shooting 29-for-43 and making 15 of 19 free throw attempts, in the Philadelphia Warriors' 127-111 win over the New York Knicks.  
**5. (Tie) Donovan Mitchell, 71 points**  
Mitchell went 22 of 34 from the field, made 7 of 15 3-pointers, with 20 free throws made and 25 attempted.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Highest Scoring Games In NBA History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An NBA player has scored 70 or more points in a game only 13 times over nearly eight decades. In the 2022-2023 season it has now happened twice in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers scored 71 points during a 131-114 win over the Houston Rockets on Sunday, equaling the eighth-highest scoring game in NBA history. Lillard matched the total scored just 55 days prior by Donovan Mitchell, who set a Cleveland Cavaliers’ record with 71 points. Mitchell’s scoring feat was the most points scored by any player in 17 years, and the Cavaliers rallied from 21 down to beat the Chicago Bulls 145-134 in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marked the first time in the same season that two different NBA players have scored 70-plus points in a single game. The key word being DIFFERENT players. Wilt Chamberlain scored 70-plus points in a game twice over a 13-day span in 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Wilt Chamberlain, 100 points - March 2, 1962&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chamberlain shot 36-for-63 from the field, setting the record for most shots made and attempted in a single game, and went 28-for-32 from the free throw line in the Philadelphia Warriors&amp;#39; 169-147 win over the New York Knicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Kobe Bryant, 81 points - Jan. 22, 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryant shot 28-for-46 from the field, including 7 of 13 from three, and went 18-for-20 from the free throw line, in the Los Angeles Lakers&amp;#39; 122-104 win over the Toronto Raptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Wilt Chamberlain, 78 points - Dec. 8, 1961&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chamberlain shot 31-for-62 and went 16 of 31 from the stripe to top the single-game scoring record of 71 points held by Elgin Baylor of the Lakers. Chamberlain also grabbed 43 rebounds in the Philadelphia Warriors&amp;#39; 151-147 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. (Tie) David Thompson, 73 points - April 9, 1978&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thompson went 28 of 38 from the field and 17 of 20 from the line for what at the time was only the NBA&amp;#39;s second non-Chamberlain 70-plus point game. Thompson, of the Denver Nuggets, got the total green light during a 139-137 loss to the Detroit Pistons in the final game of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Tie) Wilt Chamberlain, 73 points - Nov. 16, 1962 and Jan. 13, 1962&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chamberlain shooting 29-for-43 and making 15 of 19 free throw attempts, in the Philadelphia Warriors&amp;#39; 127-111 win over the New York Knicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. (Tie) Donovan Mitchell, 71 points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell went 22 of 34 from the field, made 7 of 15 3-pointers, with 20 free throws made and 25 attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. (Tie) Damian Lillard, 71 points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lillard was 22-of-38 from the floor and made all 14 of his free throw attempts (100%). Lillard also had six rebounds and six assists.&lt;/p&gt;

They weren't developmental when the Wednesday Night Wars happened, as said and repeated numerous times by HHH at the time (even if now he wants to think they were developmental). Just look at who were their main players at the time and even their midcarders: Adam Cole, reDragon, Roderick Strong, Keith Lee, Johnny Garganao, Tommaso Ciampa, Dominik Dijakovic, Damian Priest, Finn Balor, Matt Riddle, Timothy Thatcher, Moustache Mountain, Pete Dunne, Shayna Baszler, Candice LeRae, Tegan Nox, Dakota Kai, Kay Lee Ray, Toni Storm, Io Shirai, Rhea Ripley...

Actually they did.

Either way, this whole thing has been absurd, not only cause Dynamite wasn't even on its usual slot and had no shot at beating NXT but also due to how much of an idiot TK acted on Twitter, making the situation way worse than it would've been had he kept quiet, not talked trash and just moved on. In fact, the fact that they stacked NXT that much should be a win for him, as it shows that, even if not an actual threat (which let's be honest, WWE won't probably have it in a very long time if they ever get threatened at all), they see AEW as a serious rival, which is incredibly remarkable for a company that's only 4 years old and hasn't still recovered from all the turmoil they endured last year and even this one (Cody leaving, all the Punk stuff, numerous injuries in key moments).

It’s a good thing, of course. Even though adaptations need to be as faithful to their source material as possible, they also need to take advantage of their medium in areas where the manga can’t. I don’t have time to list out my full thoughts now, so I’ll just lay them out as briefly as possible.

- I couldn’t help but laugh at the angels carrying Bond’s spirit away.
- I didn’t expect Loid to sound like he was on the verge of tears! I think Bond’s imagination allowed the team (and Eguchi) to take advantage of that. I like it. It’s like the dad got a lot closer to the dog than he expected.
- Seeing Bond’s death dinner from his POV was a lot more terrifying than I thought.
- Aw, they got rid of the blood. I get it, though, TV censorship. I still thought it would’ve been a good way to portray Yor’s murderous tendencies.
- I like the extra details in Bond’s thought process. The original manga just showed the faces, which isn’t necessarily bad.
- The music the (K)NoW_NAME folks composed for Bond’s adventure was great. Not to mention seeing the beginning parts animated. Unfortunately, I was let down when the second half of the adventure got the slideshow treatment. I expected more out of it. Ah well.
- I felt so bad seeing Bond tearing up.
- I find it interesting how Twilight thought of Born Industries’ rumored involvement with Project Apple instead of telling it directly to Bond. I can’t tell whether it’s on CR’s side or the anime team’s, but judging by how subtly muffled Twilight’s voice sounded after that thought, I’m betting it’s the latter. I could be wrong, though.
- I noticed an interesting change about the scientist who got dropkicked: in the manga, he was backing away a bit, flabbergasted at a masked dog. However, here in the anime, he was trying to escape and get help. I like that change. It helped ensure a smooth transition to the key panel.
- Bond’s dropkick was really good. Stella to whoever was in charge of that!
- Wow, Loid’s meal for Bond looked really good. Not only that, but Yor petting Bond was also a nice touch.
- I was expecting Bond to cry out of happiness, but seeing and hearing his joy made up more than enough for me.
- It’s so good to hear Henderson, Damian, and the boys again.
- Wimpsons’ roast beef? Interesting. The manga’s localization called the place Wimplins.
- The sudden cut to Ewen and Emile loafing around was great. Not to mention how much time it took for Henderson to process the slovenly behavior.
- Seeing Ewen and Emile joining in with Damian’s punishment had me all warm and fuzzy. It’s so good to see the boys looking out for their bro and not just sucking up to him as the scion of the Desmond family.
- I loved seeing the boys pretending to be Imperial Scholars in the manga, so I never expected to love them more in anime form!
- Henderson’s mental note of the boys’ friendship was… preciously elegant, as he put it.
- I was looking forward to seeing and hearing Mr. Green! He both looked and sounded great.
- When Henderson gave out a new punishment, I loved how the camera focused on Mr. Green. Seeing his smile made me think he was like ‘Leave it to me, Master Henderson!’
- The boys’ “drowning” had me smirking like a maniac. The camerawork was great!
- (K)NoW_NAME’s insert song, Little Things, was great! I didn’t expect Damian and the boys to get their own for their fishing montage.
- I couldn’t help but see myself in Damian when he remembered he wasn’t out to have fun. I often feel like I fool around too much, especially here.
- When Mr. Green talked about creative minds benefiting from R&amp;R, I remembered Endo-sensei taking his long break. I get that the other manga folks are upset over the pacing, but he really needs it.
- I don’t know why I was worried about Damian trying to turn off his brain getting cut. It was still good to see Damian gobble up everything related to Stellas, though.
- “Picnic” being used as a codeword for defecting to Westalis via a third-party country was some really good world-building. I can already guess why, but Ewen still had a really good question.
- I had VERY high expectations, from the visuals to the music, and CloverWorks and (K)NoW_NAME delivered! Stella Lake was so beautiful and the music accompanying the scene helped elevate it. I enjoyed every single frame as a result.
- Seeing Henderson smiling at Mr. Green’s report was so good. He knew exactly what the children needed. Can there be any other housemaster/teacher more elegant than Henderson himself?

Even though I had my own nitpicks about Bond’s segment, seeing Damian and his buds’ research trip made up a lot for this episode. As a result, I enjoyed it as a whole. Nothing too off-putting. It was so good to see the boys enjoying themselves. Seeing Mr. Green encouraging them the whole way was great, too!

Your title and subtitle fonts are also very cutesy. This and the purple and the cartoon spider make this look more like a sweet romance, which is incongruent with the rest of the cover. 

Your longer blurb eventually gets to the point that they meet at a Halloween party, but the Halloween theme doesn't come across strongly enough on the cover to make it seem like it's a Halloween story and nothing about the book conveys a Halloween theme, so it doesn't really work.

You waste a lot of your prime blurb space defining the parameters of the relationship. This can just be: Sizzling hot older man/younger woman age gap story (or similar)! You also don't need to emphasise the 18+ in the short blurb, just the longer one, especially as there's nothing in your cover or blurb that implies that neither of them are adults. Make the most of the brief space that you have to really sell people on the book.  


Your longer blurb is more effective than your short one. It's also potentially a turn-off for some female readers to imply that some women who willingly submit to men don't know their worth. Unless this is a key part of a kink in the book, I'd avoid this type of language completely.

I'd go with something more like:   


I've been crushing hard on my daddy's boss for months. I'm tired of playing around with boys and Damian Slater is the alpha of my dreams. My parents' Halloween party is my big chance to persuade this dominant, hot older man that I can be whatever he wants me to be.

At the moment, they point to a ""one night"" encounter, but the length of your story and the referenced angst suggest something that evolves over time.  


If it is the latter, then it's more like Morrigan had finally managed to seduce her dad's sexy alpha boss and the dominant older man blew her mind. The next day at the office though, \[whatever happens\] but now Morrigan can't stop wanting more. \[and then whatever's going on for Damian\]

I feel like Dick, Jason, Barbara, and Tim are the best in terms of the members for a Batfamily. If I'm generous, maybe Damian and/or Steph. Outside of those characters... why do we need them? I only say Damian cause his character is heavily tethered to Batman's and he does add mythos/lore to the character so in a way, he's justified. Steph has decent enough character moments and storylines to justify her being sometimes (hence why these two are sort of on and off for me). 

Everyone else just feels redundant. A lot of them just appear to be characters that are B-Level versions of other Batfamily members and if they're not, they don't add much in terms of story or development. They almost feel like their own characters that somehow get crammed into being a part of the Batfamily. This not only crowds up the Batfamily but also hinders their character. The Batfamily has to juggle more characters and give them more screen time when the character should be given their own storyline and more focus. They should become their own as opposed to being a part of this team in particular. 

The ones I mentioned above work because not only have they had a longer history so that means more lore, they also fit the roles you'd see on not just a crime fighting team but also a real family. Dick is the hotshot oldest brother that cares for the younger siblings and works close with Dad, Jason is the rebel child that always lashes out at Dad, Barbara is the smart sister who brings new perspectives to the group and tech abilities, and Tim is the youngest sibling that takes from his sister in terms of intelligence but also learns from his brothers on how to act and defend himself. 

They all work because they fit a role needed for not only an effective unit but also good storytelling dynamics. Everyone else doesn't fit naturally. It feels more like Batman is making an Army as opposed to a family which shouldn't be the case. A big theme about Batman, despite him being edgy and dark, is family. Being an orphan raised by Alfred is a key part of his character as it shows family isn't always blood. The Robins and sidekicks should in a way enhance his character. Show that despite Batman's dark origins, he's created a beautiful and warm family. Something that Alfred gave him and now he's giving it to a new generation. 

TLDR: Batfamily is ok. BatArmy isn't. Dick, Jason, Barbara, and Tim are the only ones that work as they feel like an actual family in terms of roles and character traits (Damian and Steph being runner ups). Everyone outside of that feel redundant and unneeded to Batman's mythos, lore, and storyline. They should be their own heroes as opposed to crowding up what is a legendary team.

&lt;p&gt;Left Alone - She Loves You. This is a rabbit hole of its own, as Left Alone is a project of Damian Ojeda, who’s most well known for Sadness. I consider him to be the best metal musician, he’s released a dozen or so albums under the Sadness project, 3 or 4 under Left Alone, and he has another half dozen projects besides. She Loves You is heartbreaking and relatable if you’re recovering from a breakup or relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drohtnung. Anything by Drohtnung at all. Not strictly DSBM but it’s the most joyless, depressing project I’ve ever heard. It almost sounds evil, not of this world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope these help you. I’d love to hear your thought of these if you listen to any of them. This is a pretty comprehensive list that give you a few of the different styles and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

* We came a playin game from beating the eventual Eastern Conference champs, which isn't saying much for us but it tells you that if you play stellar D and get hot from the field that you are a contender, at least in the East.
* Last year's team started Pat Bev who shot 31% from three and had no other offensive game to speak of. His replacement is Jevon Carter who shot 42% from three last year -- I know he probably had more open looks with the Bucks but still there's no argument that he's at least as good on D and a better offensive player.
* Philly (Harden problems) and Miami (lost two starters) are worse than last year. 
* The Celtics are an injury-prone unicorn injury away from the front court of Vuc's dreams.
* The Bucks lost the Bulls killer (Grayson Allen) and their best point of attack defender in Holliday and we have a guy purpose built to make Damian Lillard types uncomfortable: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DynmAOvTrf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DynmAOvTrf8).
* Vuc shot 40% from 3 the year before he came the Bulls. Let's assume he gets back to that.
* Demar took 1.9 three pointers per game with the Bulls in the 2021-2022 season at a 35% make rate. In 2017-2018, he shot almost twice that number and his 3P% was 31%. Can we hope that he'll double his three point attempts and raise the make rate a couple points to something reasonable like 34%? For comparison, note that Jayson Tatum shot 35% from three over the last two seasons.
* Zach was clearly injured the first half of last season and only started showing that crazy Zach explosion later on. What if he's 100% Zach all season long? More importantly, Zach has been a guy who improves his game every year. Can this be the year he improves on his playmaking a little bit?
* Pat and Coby should improve.
* Alex Caruso continues to play as hard as Alex Caruso and he gives us 60+ games again.

Given the above, I see no reason why we can't be third seed and make it to the Eastern Conference finals. With a couple of key injuries to other teams, we make the finals.

Mia slept, the kids immersed themselves in tablets and a long call with Portland Trail Blazers GM Joe Cronin delivered Horst what he had been hoping to hear: A growing conviction that the Blazers' best deal for Damian Lillard belonged with the Bucks.

Horst dropped his family at home around 8 p.m. and drove directly to his office at the team's practice facility. He called a couple of his key front office deputies and asked them to meet him there. As the opening of training camp loomed, and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo's future teetered, Horst and his staff would work through the next 2½ days to close out one of the biggest trades in a Bucks history that includes the arrival and departure of Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

After Cronin hung up with Horst on Sunday night, he called the Blazers' governor, Jody Allen. For the first time since Lillard made a formal trade demand on July 1, Cronin had a sense of a breakthrough, he told her. There's a trade to do -- and it's with the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns.

Interviews with officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations described a clandestine, chaotic final few days on the NBA offseason's biggest trade.

Soon after ending his call with Allen, Cronin opened up his Moleskine journal and jotted notes with his blue marker. For months, in this fist-sized notebook jammed with the secrets of the summer, it had been a blue marker for Lillard trade talks. Four pages for every opposing team -- weeks and weeks of trade conversation notes, deal structures and ideas. Cronin resisted posting trade offers on elaborate whiteboards with magnets and nameplates in his practice-facility office or meeting rooms; too many prying eyes could steal a glance. Everything existed inside that Moleskine and his MacBook.

One of the most delicate parts of these superstar trade sagas resides in teams' needs to protect players under discussion, sparing feelings and preventing punctured locker rooms by keeping starry names out of the public news cycle. Cronin had to contend with a player agent who wanted to squash any deal that didn't include Lillard landing with the Miami Heat, and Horst wanted to protect the sanctity of his championship core.

As much as Antetokounmpo's franchise future ruled his pursuit of Lillard, Horst kept his two-time league Most Valuable Player out of the loop in trade conversations. To Horst, the Bucks owed Antetokounmpo the peace of mind to never have to sign off on Jrue Holiday's departure.

In many instances, organizations in similar straits not only make their star players accomplices in the trade process, they also use the circumstance to package the green light on a blockbuster deal with a promise to stay on a long-term contract. For Horst, this had to be an executive decision. He had to lean on his belief that acquiring Lillard extended the Bucks' championship window and ticked up its percentages to keep Antetokounmpo.

From the earliest days of July, Horst told Cronin their periodic conversations on Lillard had to stay secret -- or the Bucks would bail. Horst didn't want Holiday to become leverage for the Blazers in trade talks on Lillard elsewhere, which precluded Portland's ability to shop the possibility of Holiday's availability to those teams where he fit. Acquiring and keeping a 33-year-old Holiday, who has a year left on his contract, makes no sense for the Blazers. The Blazers are reshaping the roster around the No. 3 overall pick, 19-year-old Scoot Henderson, and Holiday's value resides with teams on more immediate timelines to compete for championships and pursue postseason play.

That's why Horst told Cronin that the only way a deal could happen would come with Portland canvassing the league and ultimately circling back to negotiate one-on-one with Milwaukee. That started on Sunday night. The Bucks' assets to make a trade work were easily discernible -- the 2029 first-round pick, 2028 and 2030 pick swaps and, yes, the two-time All-Star guard, Holiday.

Lillard, 33, wanted a trade and delivered the Blazers a singular destination: the Miami Heat. In recent years, there have been several stars able to create the leverage to force deals to destinations of their choosing. Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers, James Harden to the Brooklyn Nets, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal to the Suns. In the era of player empowerment, Lillard ran into complications with a $60 million yearly salary looming at 35 and 36 years old -- and no veto power on trades in his contract. Whatever his public and private posture, Lillard's power was limited. Cronin talked to his staff about controlling the tempo of the talks, slowing the process and using July and August to explore the marketplace. He studied the trade models of Brooklyn's Sean Marks with Durant, and Philadelphia's Daryl Morey with Ben Simmons. In those acrimonious showdowns, patience had been the pathway to incrementally increasing offers.

Cronin's peers, who had been in these circumstances, privately told him what he had publicly declared: His obligation was to find the best deal for the Blazers, not for Lillard. If those conflicting elements matched up, even better for everyone.

Through it all, Cronin told himself: Eliminate the emotion, the frustration, the fatigue. And most of all, Cronin implored himself: Don't settle. Don't let yourself settle.

Big trades are like puzzles -- a jumbled slab of salary matches, collective bargaining rules, positions and ages and gamesmanship. What Cronin had going for him had been the outline of a secondary deal with the Suns for center Deandre Ayton; a side negotiation that Cronin kept connecting to his larger talks on Lillard. Before Lillard ever asked out, Portland had discussed ways to acquire Ayton, and so the Suns made a natural trade partner as a third team.

&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Face the Nation, CBS News, 24 September 2023.
&gt; 
&gt; CBS News.On September 24th, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) commented on [Face the Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUIu3hesTc ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUIu3hesTc"") “I think we need to re-examine the nature of these sanctions”. She also said that “broad-based sanctions, that punish the overall economy, harm everyday working people and are driving them into the economic and political destitution, that force millions of people, not just to the United States but also to our regional partners, like Colombia”.
&gt; 
&gt; Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks came just days after Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), a key proponent of sanctions, was indicted on corruption charges. Within Venezuela and across Latin America the mood has also been changing as more political figures agree that broad or sectoral sanctions have worsened the existing economic and humanitarian crisis.
&gt; 
&gt; In Venezuela’s neighbourhood, no incumbent president backs the “maximum pressure” policy enacted by the Trump administration. The strategy included sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s financial and oil sectors, among others, and ceasing to recognise Nicolas Maduro as president. It was led, among others, by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Menendez himself, and [ousted IDB president](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/idb-directors-vote-unanimously-recommend-removal-claver-carone-sources-2022-09-22/ ""https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/idb-directors-vote-unanimously-recommend-removal-claver-carone-sources-2022-09-22/"") Mauricio Claver-Carone.
&gt; 
&gt; The current environment is markedly different from 2019; an alliance of regional leaders formed the “[Lima Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Group ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Group"")” to present a united front supporting maximum pressure. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric, who has always called out human rights abuses in Venezuela and across the region, recently [criticised economic sanctions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlfLa1b63SQ ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlfLa1b63SQ"") at the UN General Assembly alongside other heads of state.
&gt; 
&gt; Representative Ocasio-Cortez is not the first to voice this opinion in Capitol Hill, while it is [increasingly held across Washington DC](https://escobar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1227 ""https://escobar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1227""). A congressional staffer mentioned that “many lawmakers recognize that sanctions have been ineffective in achieving political change and have contributed to out-migration, but fear that taking action to lift them will bring backlash for being ‘soft’ Maduro.”
&gt; 
&gt; In [September 2022](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis-and-impact-of-us-policy ""https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-discusses-venezuelas-humanitarian-crisis-and-impact-of-us-policy""), Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said that “we are stuck inheriting a policy that did not work, that has in part contributed to a humanitarian disaster that now brings thousands and thousands of Venezuelans to our border seeking salvation”.
&gt; 
&gt; Venezuelan investment banker Rodrigo Naranjo argues that broad sanctions are suppressing private activity. As a result, most business leaders are in favour of economic sanctions being lifted. “Many executives I speak to cannot understand why they have to pay for political disputes, between the opposition and the government, and some of which have to do with internal politics in the US.” Adán Celis, the president of [Fedecámaras](https://www.globovision.com/nacional/9403/presidente-de-fedecamaras-pide-levantamiento-de-sanciones ""https://www.globovision.com/nacional/9403/presidente-de-fedecamaras-pide-levantamiento-de-sanciones""), the largest business union, has also called for an end to economic sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; The Venezuelan government has also been in coordination with [four opposition state governors](https://twitter.com/polianalitica/status/1705029891073122322 ""https://twitter.com/polianalitica/status/1705029891073122322"") to jointly demand an end to economic sanctions. In the past, opposition leaders played an essential role in giving political cover for the maximum pressure strategy.

&gt; 
&gt; NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 22: Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New ... [+] York, speaks during a press conference after announcing that U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) was indicted on corruption charges charges at the SDNY office on September 22, 2023 in New York City. Sen. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of accepting money and other benefits to help three businessmen and the Egyptian government. Menendez allegedly also used his position on the Foreign Relations committee to influence deals for New Jersey businesses with the Egyptian government. (Photo by Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)
&gt; 
&gt; Getty ImagesSenator Menendez has been indicted with new [corruption accusations](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/22/menendez-allegations-gold-cash-car-00117646 ""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/22/menendez-allegations-gold-cash-car-00117646""). As senate foreign relations committee chair, he had been a staunch proponent of regime change in Venezuela and Cuba, and of broad economic sanctions. He has worked closely with Republican Marco Rubio. He is likely to be replaced by senators Ben Cardin or Jeanne Shaheen, both of whom could work more closely with the Biden White House on this front.
&gt; 
&gt; Senator Menendez has been [charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery ""https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery"") for receiving gifts in the form of “cash, gold, a Mercedes Benz and other things of value – in exchange for Senator Menendez agreeing to use his power and influence to protect and enrich [[three] businessmen](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery ""https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery"") and to benefit the Government of Egypt”.
&gt; 
&gt; The timing is key: Menendez was trying to pass through legislation to enshrine sanctions on Venezuela in law. This effort was coming into conflict with White House negotiations with President Nicolas Maduro’s government, as part of a broader deal that could involve democratic guarantees for Venezuela’s 2024 election. The Biden administration is also expected [to ease some restrictions on Cuba](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/biden-readies-measures-to-support-cuba-s-small-business-owners ""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/biden-readies-measures-to-support-cuba-s-small-business-owners""), “to allow more US financial support of small businesses”.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; ## **What happens now with sanctions?**
&gt; 
&gt; Oil-related and secondary sanctions are likely to go away first. As we [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/08/17/venezuela-bond-sanctions-backfiring/?sh=1f54f8a2530e ""https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/08/17/venezuela-bond-sanctions-backfiring/?sh=1f54f8a2530e""), the trading ban on Venezuelan bonds is hurting US interests while it hardly affects President Maduro's position, according to various experts. Nearly a month later, the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6e5077bc-b069-4fdb-bdb8-75509c8a5348 ""https://www.ft.com/content/6e5077bc-b069-4fdb-bdb8-75509c8a5348"") reported a Venezuelan sovereign bond rally as investors increasingly expect a deal in this sector.
&gt; 
&gt; Some insiders even argue that economic sanctions policy will be determined by domestic US politics. “Nobody cares about Venezuelans,” said someone with access to Republican and Democrat lawmakers. In their view, whether they are tightened or loosened, it will have more to do with winning over House seats and the Electoral College than human rights.

&gt; NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 22: Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New ... [+] York, speaks during a press conference after announcing that U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) was indicted on corruption charges charges at the SDNY office on September 22, 2023 in New York City. Sen. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Menendez, are accused of accepting money and other benefits to help three businessmen and the Egyptian government. Menendez allegedly also used his position on the Foreign Relations committee to influence deals for New Jersey businesses with the Egyptian government. (Photo by Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)
&gt; 
&gt; Getty ImagesSenator Menendez has been indicted with new [corruption accusations](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/22/menendez-allegations-gold-cash-car-00117646 ""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/22/menendez-allegations-gold-cash-car-00117646""). As senate foreign relations committee chair, he had been a staunch proponent of regime change in Venezuela and Cuba, and of broad economic sanctions. He has worked closely with Republican Marco Rubio. He is likely to be replaced by senators Ben Cardin or Jeanne Shaheen, both of whom could work more closely with the Biden White House on this front.
&gt; 
&gt; Senator Menendez has been [charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery ""https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery"") for receiving gifts in the form of “cash, gold, a Mercedes Benz and other things of value – in exchange for Senator Menendez agreeing to use his power and influence to protect and enrich [[three] businessmen](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery ""https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-senator-robert-menendez-his-wife-and-three-new-jersey-businessmen-charged-bribery"") and to benefit the Government of Egypt”.
&gt; 
&gt; The timing is key: Menendez was trying to pass through legislation to enshrine sanctions on Venezuela in law. This effort was coming into conflict with White House negotiations with President Nicolas Maduro’s government, as part of a broader deal that could involve democratic guarantees for Venezuela’s 2024 election. The Biden administration is also expected [to ease some restrictions on Cuba](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/biden-readies-measures-to-support-cuba-s-small-business-owners ""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/biden-readies-measures-to-support-cuba-s-small-business-owners""), “to allow more US financial support of small businesses”.

&gt; 
&gt; ## **What happens now with sanctions?**
&gt; 
&gt; Oil-related and secondary sanctions are likely to go away first. As we [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/08/17/venezuela-bond-sanctions-backfiring/?sh=1f54f8a2530e ""https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/08/17/venezuela-bond-sanctions-backfiring/?sh=1f54f8a2530e""), the trading ban on Venezuelan bonds is hurting US interests while it hardly affects President Maduro's position, according to various experts. Nearly a month later, the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6e5077bc-b069-4fdb-bdb8-75509c8a5348 ""https://www.ft.com/content/6e5077bc-b069-4fdb-bdb8-75509c8a5348"") reported a Venezuelan sovereign bond rally as investors increasingly expect a deal in this sector.
&gt; 
&gt; Some insiders even argue that economic sanctions policy will be determined by domestic US politics. “Nobody cares about Venezuelans,” said someone with access to Republican and Democrat lawmakers. In their view, whether they are tightened or loosened, it will have more to do with winning over House seats and the Electoral College than human rights.

&lt;p&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Face the Nation, CBS News, 24 September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBS News.On September 24th, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) commented on &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUIu3hesTc"" title=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMUIu3hesTc""&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/a&gt; “I think we need to re-examine the nature of these sanctions”. She also said that “broad-based sanctions, that punish the overall economy, harm everyday working people and are driving them into the economic and political destitution, that force millions of people, not just to the United States but also to our regional partners, like Colombia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks came just days after Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), a key proponent of sanctions, was indicted on corruption charges. Within Venezuela and across Latin America the mood has also been changing as more political figures agree that broad or sectoral sanctions have worsened the existing economic and humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Venezuela’s neighbourhood, no incumbent president backs the “maximum pressure” policy enacted by the Trump administration. The strategy included sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s financial and oil sectors, among others, and ceasing to recognise Nicolas Maduro as president. It was led, among others, by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), Menendez himself, and &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/idb-directors-vote-unanimously-recommend-removal-claver-carone-sources-2022-09-22/"" title=""https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/idb-directors-vote-unanimously-recommend-removal-claver-carone-sources-2022-09-22/""&gt;ousted IDB president&lt;/a&gt; Mauricio Claver-Carone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current environment is markedly different from 2019; an alliance of regional leaders formed the “&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Group"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_Group""&gt;Lima Group&lt;/a&gt;” to present a united front supporting maximum pressure. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric, who has always called out human rights abuses in Venezuela and across the region, recently &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlfLa1b63SQ"" title=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlfLa1b63SQ""&gt;criticised economic sanctions&lt;/a&gt; at the UN General Assembly alongside other heads of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative Ocasio-Cortez is not the first to voice this opinion in Capitol Hill, while it is &lt;a href=""https://escobar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1227"" title=""https://escobar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1227""&gt;increasingly held across Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;. A congressional staffer mentioned that “many lawmakers recognize that sanctions have been ineffective in achieving political change and have contributed to out-migration, but fear that taking action to lift them will bring backlash for being ‘soft’ Maduro.”&lt;/p&gt;

I can see a rough parallel between Claudius and Vir, but only a rough one.

In the more likely scenario (Barnes + Boucher + Porter + Young + Flynn) they would still have D.Schroder, G.Dick, G.Trent, McDaniels, Temple, P.Achiqua, C.Koloko.

I guess this is what I'm looking at.  The trade you're talking about simply is not worth Dame.  Porter has health issues and one year left on his deal.  Boucher is a solid backup center (he shouldn't be playing PF or god forbid when they put him at SF) who probably is not good enough to start for anyone.  Thaddeus Young is 35 with one year left on his contract, also not a huge value chip, and he's not really even playing at a backup level anymore.  Malachi Flynn is a project that doesn't seem to be panning out.  This package is worth maybe half of a Damian Lillard, and most are not even pieces that Portland would want as a young team in a rebuild.  In order to actually make a trade for Dame, they'd have to trade most or all of the players you listed off for depth, if only for the equivalent value and salary matching.  But even then, Portland does not want those players.  Garrett Temple is 36 years old and couldn't manage to be efficient or play good defense in garbage time for 6.5 minutes a game last season.  He's not legitimate depth.  Jalen McDaniels is showing flashes but there are real problems with giving him more than about 15 minutes per game.  He might be a piece that Portland is willing to roll the dice on and see if he develops more, but probably not.  Honestly, I'm not going to keep unpacking this because this is legitimate a trash lineup and there really isn't any trade package the Raps could give for Dame that wouldn't involve OG or Siakam, which would defeat the purpose.  Barnes and filler is not enough.

&gt;  Sometimes you're only really going 3 guys deep on the bench anyway.And they could still make moves after this to add to that depth. Via other trades or they would be a good spot for players on the buyout market.

You're right about that, but there's no scenario that leaves the Raptors with 3 solid bench players while holding onto Dame/OG/Siakam/Poeltl.

&gt;  It's not every team has elite depth. Until there's actually a return for Harden the 76ers depth is Pat Bev, J.Springer, D.House, P.Reed, F.Petrusev, &amp; M.Bambathe Bucks depth is M.Beasley, P.Connaughton, J.Crowder, B.Portis, R.Lopezthe Celtics depth is a disgruntled M.Brogdon, P.Pritchard, S.Hauser, O.Brissett, R.Williams, Luke Kornet.

You're right, it's not every team with elite depth.  But it is every team that wants to compete for a title.

&gt;  Who is dominating you with their bench?  Heck, the Nuggets just won with I.Smith, R.Jackson, B.Hyland, P.Watson, C.Braun, B.Brown, Z.Nnaji

They got rid of Bones halfway through the season, and Reggie Jackson didn't play any significant minutes for them.  The Nuggets bench is a lot better than you're representing them, and it has a lot more to do with defense than offense.  That being said, the Nuggets bench was really efficient scoring, despite not hitting 3's at a great clip.  If you saw the WCF, the Nuggets bench ate the Lakers alive.  When LeBron or AD went out, the Lakers were in trouble.  When Jokic or Murray went out, the other just held the fort on offense while the backups were monsters on defense.  Frankly, a lot of their counting stats during the regular season aren't representative because they made a lot of midseason moves.  But by the playoffs they had it buttoned up and that bench was dominant.

&gt;  None of that applies to Dame. Durability is not a major concern with him.

Dame has missed 106 games in the last 4 seasons and he is gonna turn 33 this season.  It absolutely applies to him.

&gt;  The Suns are also not the Raptors.

No, but it would be a similar situation if they gave up what they would have to in order to get Dame.

&gt;  The Suns have to go through the Grizzlies, Kings, Warriors, Lakers, Clippers (if they get Harden), and Nuggets.But i was talking about the Raptors. The Raptors will have to go through a possibly depleted 76ers team, mediocre ceiling Knicks &amp; Cavs teams, Boston who has major coaching &amp; clutch concerns, and the Bucks who have major health concerns. I would not be surprised to see Toronto finish 3rd, beat Boston and then if anything happens to any of the 3 in Milwaukee the Raptors become the favorite in that series.

This is the point I will definitely concede to you.  The east is imploding.  Bucks are getting older/injured, Sixers are a train wreck in slow motion right now, Celtics have coaching/fit/injury issues they haven't fixed, and the Heat do not quite have the talent to win a chip and haven't made any real changes (and won't get Dame).  Like you, I don't take the Cavs or Knicks seriously.  I see the Hawks as a more serious up and coming team, to be honest.

&gt;  The media isn't pushing Dame trade rumors. Dame is the one who started themselves.

It's definitely both.

&gt;  The media isn't just making up some BS about the Bulls thinking about getting involved. The Raptors have always made sense as a destination.

The media has definitely made up a ton of things since this whole scenario got started.  They constantly throw shit at the wall to see what sticks in these situations.  They drive engagement through clicks and sell advertising with it, and there is no penalty to them for saying ""sources say"" when they make up bullsh*t like there would be with real journalism.  Did the Raptors make some calls, do some talking, throw out an offer?  Very probably, yes.  There's no reason not to pick up the phone and see what the price is looking like.  Did they make a serious offer and are they willing to give up what it would take to get him?  Almost certainly not.

&gt;  They would immediately vault to being one of the top teams in their conference, so it makes sense from a competitive standpoint (much more than any fan-created Thunder or Jazz trade).

I'm not gonna argue about other teams, you're right that a lot of the speculation for these destinations doesn't make sense.  But let's look at a couple key issues.  One:  The Blazers have no reason to want anyone on the Raptors roster outside of Scottie Barnes.  No one else is both worth their time and fits their young, rebuilding timeline.  Even Scottie Barnes is a rough fit, because they already have two guards who need the ball in their hands to be effective.  I think Scottie can be great, but he would need to have a clear, defined roll and a lot more touches than he's getting.  He won't have either of those things in Portland.  Two:  Everything that Portland could package with Scottie Barnes to make the deal happen, if Portland were interested, are assets they would then have to flip.  There is no guarantee they could flip them, especially since so many people on the Raptors roster only have one year left on their contracts, so they would be committing to letting a certain amount of resources walk away without a return after this season.

&gt; But, he can.

&gt;Miami + Dame = East contender

&gt; Boston + Dame = title favorite

&gt; 76ers + Dame = East contender

&gt; NY Knicks + Dame = East contender

&gt; Toronto + Dame = East contender

Miami + Dame would be a contender, sure.  Why in the world would Portland or any other third team give up the kind of resources Dame is worth for the peanuts that Miami has?  They've made Jimmy and Bam untouchable, and they have nothing else but Tyler Herro and bad picks.  Miami stopped their dialogue with Portland because they knew it wasn't happening.  Boston + Dame is a contender...if they don't give up anything.  Know what they'd have to give up, realistically, to get Dame?  Jaylen Brown.  You think Portland wants that contract on a rebuild, even if their intention would only be to move him again?  Absolutely not.  76ers + Dame is a destination that could make sense, but there is so much wild, weird shit going on there that I won't speculate.  Sixers would have to give up Harden, which may not be all bad, but the Blazers don't want Harden.  You keep ignoring what the Blazers want in all of these equations and just inserting him on teams like a fan casting.  The Blazers want picks and early 20's talent.  Which brings us to the Knicks.  What do the Knicks have that Portland could want?  Mitchell Robinson is a bit on the old side for their timeline, but he could be a good fit, assuming they can unload Nurkic somewhere.  He's not nearly enough, and Portland definitely doesn't want Jalen Brunson on a roster with Sharpe and Scoot.  Immanuel Quickly might make sense, but again they're still short for a Dame haul, their picks are worthless, and their other assets are RJ Barret and Julius Randle, who Portland absolutely do not want.

If there were any good deal that made sense for the Blazers, they would have taken it.  They are not in a good situation in Dame limbo, and they are desperate to get a return for him.  No team that is competitive can afford to give up what they'd need to get Dame, or a deal would have already happened.  We're going to sit in limbo for a while and then a team is going to give a good player and a ton of picks for Dame, he is not going to flop onto a contender.",False,False,,,,,0.0,1695449362.0,,False,0.0,{},k1tk4gz,False,t3_16owtjk,False,t1_k1tk4gz,False,t1_k1qar5w,/r/nba/comments/16owtjk/bourguet_suns_receiving_calls_on_deandre_ayton_as/k1tk4gz/,,1.0,True,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

[],False,,Kinterou,,,,[],,,,text,t2_7xjtdcm6j,False,False,"Before I've chosen my first and second name, there was just one other. I did go by Harley back then because it was a cool and neutral name. I needed a name to test if that's what I actually wanted and needed and it felt better to have a name I could use as a nickname first. I could put it anywhere and no one questioned it because it was neutral.

As soon as I knew it wasn't just a phase or anything, I picked a masculine name. My current first and second name.

The first was one I've definitely chosen because of the meaning. One od the guys who made me realize I'm trans was named that and when he made clear why that was his name, I took that one too. But not only because of that. I immediatelly remembered that I loved that name already when I was a little kid. I can't remember where I heard it first but I always had a connection to that name so it had to be that one.

The second was actually the second name of one of my own characters. He was the first character I ever gave a very detailed background and had a strong connection with due to his background and his abilities I would have wished for to have myself. Actually by accident, because he was meant to be a side character but ended up fitting more into the main character role. But he made me realize what my favorite type of characters are and I thought to honor how much that character gave to me, I could took his second name. (What may be a bit weird as soon as you know that character actually hates his second name for a very understandable reason.) Anyways, the meaning was great too and did fit with the first one. I couldn't miss that opportunity.

I also picked a third name, but luckily dropped that one later again, because that's the name of my godchild now and I bet it wouldn't be his name if I had chosen it for me. I totally wanted three names, but wasn't sure about the last one because even if it fit with the other ones, the meaning didn't and I thought people would think I only picked it because of an anime character. What may have been true for a very little part. For a while I did just go by two names, but still felt like a third one would be great. So I asked my mom how she would have named her third kid if it would have survived. I liked the name, but wasn't sure if that was a good idea, so we did another thing. I wrote down a list of names and she did too. We then wrote down all names we both had on a third list and I let her choose the one she liked the most. Damian. That one became my third name and I couldn't be happier about it. It fits the meaning of the other two, it sounds nice and also is great as an authors name.

Some were put in consideration as first name, but I knew they wouldn't fit me / would not sound like that was me, even if I loved those names.

I did go by Harley back then because it was a cool and neutral name. I needed a name to test if that&amp;#39;s what I actually wanted and needed and it felt better to have a name I could use as a nickname first. I could put it anywhere and no one questioned it because it was neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I knew it wasn&amp;#39;t just a phase or anything, I picked a masculine name. My current first and second name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was one I&amp;#39;ve definitely chosen because of the meaning. One od the guys who made me realize I&amp;#39;m trans was named that and when he made clear why that was his name, I took that one too. But not only because of that. I immediatelly remembered that I loved that name already when I was a little kid. I can&amp;#39;t remember where I heard it first but I always had a connection to that name so it had to be that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was actually the second name of one of my own characters. He was the first character I ever gave a very detailed background and had a strong connection with due to his background and his abilities I would have wished for to have myself. Actually by accident, because he was meant to be a side character but ended up fitting more into the main character role. But he made me realize what my favorite type of characters are and I thought to honor how much that character gave to me, I could took his second name. (What may be a bit weird as soon as you know that character actually hates his second name for a very understandable reason.) Anyways, the meaning was great too and did fit with the first one. I couldn&amp;#39;t miss that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also picked a third name, but luckily dropped that one later again, because that&amp;#39;s the name of my godchild now and I bet it wouldn&amp;#39;t be his name if I had chosen it for me. I totally wanted three names, but wasn&amp;#39;t sure about the last one because even if it fit with the other ones, the meaning didn&amp;#39;t and I thought people would think I only picked it because of an anime character. What may have been true for a very little part. For a while I did just go by two names, but still felt like a third one would be great. So I asked my mom how she would have named her third kid if it would have survived. I liked the name, but wasn&amp;#39;t sure if that was a good idea, so we did another thing. I wrote down a list of names and she did too. We then wrote down all names we both had on a third list and I let her choose the one she liked the most. Damian. That one became my third name and I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier about it. It fits the meaning of the other two, it sounds nice and also is great as an authors name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of other names on my list, but none of them ever made the test. Some were put in consideration as first name, but I knew they wouldn&amp;#39;t fit me / would not sound like that was me, even if I loved those names.

1. The Bloodline storyline has been the main focus for the last 3 years but lately Roman Reigns, who’s the Undisputed Universal Champion and has been for over 1,000 days and counting, has been MIA and not around for weeks now. His cousins The Usos who were a team are now split up with Jimmy on SmackDown while Jey is on Raw. Jimmy turned on Roman and left The Bloodline which he got his brother Jey too but he ultimately turned on him too when Jey faced Roman for the title because he didn’t want him to turn into what Roman is. The Usos Brother and Roman’s other cousin Solo Sikoa is also on SmackDown around with Paul Heyman. Jimmy looks to be trying to get back into The Bloodline for some reason.

2. AJ Styles has been involved with The Bloodline lately due to how Jimmy disrespected Mia Yim, a fellow member of The OC group with him. He faced Solo Sikoa two weeks ago and lost thanks to Jimmy. He then faced Jimmy last week which he won.

3. Iyo Sky is the current Women’s Champion. Last week Asuka, who is the former champion, appeared and had a face off with Iyo in the ring with Asuka wanting back her title that Iyo cashed in the MITB on when she was in a triple threat match at SummerSlam. They will be facing off in a title match next week.

4. LA Knight who’s a SmackDown superstar has been feuding with Raw superstar The Miz. They had a match at the last PPV in which LA Kight won. They will be having their second match tonight.

5. The Judgment Day, Finn Balor and Damian Priest (who’s also the MITB holder) are the current Undisputed Tag Team Champions which they can appear on both brands. They’ll probably be on. Last week they jumped AJ after he won his match and put him in the ring for Solo to attack. Still not sure what that was all about.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bloodline storyline has been the main focus for the last 3 years but lately Roman Reigns, who’s the Undisputed Universal Champion and has been for over 1,000 days and counting, has been MIA and not around for weeks now. His cousins The Usos who were a team are now split up with Jimmy on SmackDown while Jey is on Raw. Jimmy turned on Roman and left The Bloodline which he got his brother Jey too but he ultimately turned on him too when Jey faced Roman for the title because he didn’t want him to turn into what Roman is. The Usos Brother and Roman’s other cousin Solo Sikoa is also on SmackDown around with Paul Heyman. Jimmy looks to be trying to get back into The Bloodline for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AJ Styles has been involved with The Bloodline lately due to how Jimmy disrespected Mia Yim, a fellow member of The OC group with him. He faced Solo Sikoa two weeks ago and lost thanks to Jimmy. He then faced Jimmy last week which he won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iyo Sky is the current Women’s Champion. Last week Asuka, who is the former champion, appeared and had a face off with Iyo in the ring with Asuka wanting back her title that Iyo cashed in the MITB on when she was in a triple threat match at SummerSlam. They will be facing off in a title match next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA Knight who’s a SmackDown superstar has been feuding with Raw superstar The Miz. They had a match at the last PPV in which LA Kight won. They will be having their second match tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Judgment Day, Finn Balor and Damian Priest (who’s also the MITB holder) are the current Undisputed Tag Team Champions which they can appear on both brands. They’ll probably be on. Last week they jumped AJ after he won his match and put him in the ring for Solo to attack. Still not sure what that was all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The medal was presented by Westpac NSW Blues coach Brad Fittler at The Star Event Centre in front of more than 500 guests on a night where 20 awards were announced for Representative Competitions, Major Competitions, Junior Representative Competitions and community.


Emma Tonegato was named the NSW Women’s Origin Player of the Year, Liam Martin won the True Blues Award, NSW Women’s Origin co-captain Kezie Apps took out the Sky Blues Award, while Cody Walker won The Daily Telegraph People’s Choice Award.

To’o has represented NSW nine times since making his debut in 2021 and played a key role in the Game Three win in Sydney this year. He ran for 258m, including 102 post-contact, had a line break, an offload two tackle busts and scored the opening try of the game.

Martin overcame injury to play all three games in this year’s series, including a well-worked try in Game One in Adelaide, while Walker was recalled for Game Three in Sydney and turned in a starring performance to ensure the Blues would finish the series on a high.

“Brian epitomises the attributes of a NSW Blues player as he always gives his all whenever he pulls on the jersey,” Westpac NSW Blues coach Brad Fittler said.

“He is a hard worker at training and on the field, and brings a great energy to camp that other players enjoy being around.

“Liam brings plenty of natural aggression to the team and I can always count on him to do a job for me, while Cody showed just how dangerous he can be after being recalled for Game Three.

“I congratulate all the winners from the State of Origin series, as well as all the winners who have been recognised across our competitions and community for the wonderful seasons they’ve had and the contributions they’ve made.”


Tonegato, who was presented her medal by Harvey Norman NSW Sky Blues coach Kylie Hilder, had an equally impressive series for the NSW Sky Blues, including Game Two in Townsville where she ran for 238m, had 11 tackle busts and two offloads.

 
Apps overcame injury to lead the Sky Blues this season and celebrated a record 11th appearance for her state. She led from the front after averaging 79 run metres per game, making five tackle busts and 37 tackles with an efficiency of 97 per cent.

“Emma deserved the NSW Women’s Origin Player of the Year as she was so consistent in both games and always a threat whenever she touched the ball,” Hilder said. “She is such a professional both on and off the field, and is an absolute pleasure to coach.

“I am so happy for Kezie as she had to work so hard to get just get herself on the field this year after suffering her injury. To go out and perform like she did, and in a new position as well, was inspiring for her teammates and highlighted her leadership qualities.”

Canberra Raiders young gun Ethan Strange was named NSW Under 19s Origin Player of the Year after scoring a hat-trick in the win against Queensland; while Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs hooker Chelsea Makira took out the NSW Under 19s Women’s Origin Player of the Year after a performance where she scored two tries.

South Sydney Rabbitohs halfback Dean Hawkins was named The Knock-On Effect NSW Cup Player of the Year after steering his club to a second-placed finish.

Hawkins has played 19 games for the club in 2023 for six tries, 48 goals, 17 try assists, 15 line break assists and an average of 340 kicking metres per game.

Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs forward Holli Wheeler was named Harvey Norman NSW Women’s Premiership Player of the Year after leading her club to a Grand Final appearance.

Wheeler missed out on playing in the historic 1-0 Grand Final loss to Mounties after suffering a knee injury in the Semi-final.

The Gordon Lowrie Memorial Community Volunteer of the Year Award winner was also announced with the honour going to Taree Red Rovers Junior Rugby League Club President Christopher Hollis.

Hollis, who also holds roles at the club as referee, ground manager and coach, has been providing Rugby League opportunities to Indigenous and socially disadvantaged children for the past 25 years.


The Brad Fittler Medal night recognises and celebrates the achievements of players across all NSWRL teams and competitions, from Origin to seniors, juniors and women, as well as the contributions of referees, club officials and volunteers.

Other players to have won the Brad Fittler Medal include Steve Menzies (2006), Danny Buderus (2008), Paul Gallen (2011), Robbie Farah (2012), David Klemmer (2017), Tedesco (2018-19, 22), Nathan Cleary (2020) and Tom Trbojevic (2021).

Her plan only works in the very immediate short term. Keep in mind what kinda city Gotham is. It's New York at its worst x10. New York only managed to get things under control because they went hard at getting all the mafia groups at once, keeping on the pressure to leave no power vacuum for new groups to emerge. Granted they went too far afterwards giving police the power to stop and frisk anyone for any reason. But if the problem is the violent organised crime groups, then the New York approach of sending the full force of the government focusing on those groups, in particular the bosses, is key. There's none of that here.

With all the regular terrorist attacks of the supervillains, this plan will do nothing good for Gotham. Gotham's police have a hard enough time dealing with crime (they also have to deal with the dangerous criminal &amp; terrosist attacks), so they wouldn't be able to stop any of it. And now with the Batfamily at odds with each other and not being a deterrent, things will only get worse. 

It's easy to say ""owh they have bigger fish to fry, the criminals are just robbing the rich &amp; aren't harming anyone."" But keep in mind, the people who are able to rob the rich of Gotham aren't the ones going into crime because of poverty. They're career criminals. They're literally henchmen. It's like training a low level mafia member to rob better and expecting them to be happy with just that and not make their own mafia group.

Leave those criminals alone, robbing the rich, getting more money &amp; riches than they ever dreamed of being able to rob, and without anyone to really stop them. You'll just end up with newer crime organisations, crime bosses, and possibly supervillains emerging from this. And what happens when they try to one up the established bosses &amp; villains? You'll have a mafia war or a lot of dead ex-henchmen that bit off more than they can chew, with more innocent casualties sprinkled all over.

Her plan is set up to fail. That's the most obvious conclusion of this plot.

But if the problem is the violent organised crime groups, then the New York approach of sending the full force of the government focusing on those groups, in particular the bosses, is key. There&amp;#39;s none of that here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the regular terrorist attacks of the supervillains, this plan will do nothing good for Gotham. Gotham&amp;#39;s police have a hard enough time dealing with crime (they also have to deal with the dangerous criminal &amp;amp; terrosist attacks), so they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to stop any of it. And now with the Batfamily at odds with each other and not being a deterrent, things will only get worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to say &amp;quot;owh they have bigger fish to fry, the criminals are just robbing the rich &amp;amp; aren&amp;#39;t harming anyone.&amp;quot; But keep in mind, the people who are able to rob the rich of Gotham aren&amp;#39;t the ones going into crime because of poverty. They&amp;#39;re career criminals. They&amp;#39;re literally henchmen. It&amp;#39;s like training a low level mafia member to rob better and expecting them to be happy with just that and not make their own mafia group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave those criminals alone, robbing the rich, getting more money &amp;amp; riches than they ever dreamed of being able to rob, and without anyone to really stop them. You&amp;#39;ll just end up with newer crime organisations, crime bosses, and possibly supervillains emerging from this. And what happens when they try to one up the established bosses &amp;amp; villains? You&amp;#39;ll have a mafia war or a lot of dead ex-henchmen that bit off more than they can chew, with more innocent casualties sprinkled all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her plan is set up to fail. That&amp;#39;s the most obvious conclusion of this plot. But the writing choice to make all of the batfamily except Damian be in support of that plan is utterly stupid and out of character. They of all people should know better.&lt;/p&gt;

towards capital expenditure, new tanks.They're also employing some 
budgetary black magic to ensure that funding for defence modernisation is 
smooth and reliable from year to year. I talk about the Armed Forces Support Fund 
and the way it's intended to function, but I don't want to risk getting political, 
so if you're interested look it up yourself. Plus I'm also not sure how many of my viewers 
actually want to hear me spend 15 minutes talking about the variety of funding 
mechanisms or budgetary structures you can use in order to support 
military capital spending. You're all very patient people, 
but I imagine even you have limits. But here's the key point. Even 
with all the budgetary black magic and PPP advantages that Poland can muster, 
this is going to be a very expensive process. Especially if they 
sustain it out to the 2030s 

[00:24:15] and actually affect delivery 
of all of these ordered systems.It's going to be a 
significant stretch for Poland, this is a country where 
borrowing costs are significant. Government debt to GDP ratio is low 
compared to many other nations, but the cost of debt is 
also relatively high. Military spending isn't free, 
it comes with trade-offs. Every tank that you purchase is 
more debt taken on by the country, or less funding for things 
like schools and hospitals. Defence spending is obviously essential 
for national security to some extent. But make no mistake, the 
sort of order scheme that Poland has put in place is 
going to be pretty expensive. And so if Polish economic conditions 
become difficult or the political winds change, 

[00:24:56] I wouldn't be surprised if Poland rolls back 
on some of these planned initiatives.But for now let's assume 
it's all going to happen. Let's assume that Poland really 
is getting 1,000 Korean tanks and almost 1,000 artillery pieces 
and rocket launchers. Let's return instead to that critical question. Why on earth is a country in Eastern Europe 
that neighbours one of the major European armoured vehicle manufacturers, 
Germany, buying tanks from Korea? Because this is a dizzying order book 
of tanks, artillery systems and aircraft from a supplier that is physically 
very far removed from Europe. The defence industrial base in South 
Korea is configured first and foremost to design and manufacture 
equipment to protect South Korea. Which means it's configured 
for a Korean environment. 

[00:25:44] Think less Eastern European plain 
and more Korean mountain ranges.Plus there are the logistical costs 
of moving equipment and supplies from Korea all the way to 
Eastern Europe, and the fact that Poland already has an incumbent 
force of Abrams and Leopard. So what is it about these Korean 
super-weapons that makes them so appealing? And because I'm not the right person 
to judge the fighting capabilities of a particular tank or armoured vehicle, 
I thought I'd bring back someone who is. At this point The Chieftain is 
basically YouTube's resident tanker. From a tanker's perspective, how good is K2? And why would the Poles want to buy it? 
Here's what he came back with. - Right, Polish acquisition and the K2. Obviously I didn't scare off so many 
people that Perun didn't ask me back. 

[00:26:30] But don't worry, I'm not going to 
rabbit on for as long as I did on BDAR.There are two parts of this. 
Firstly the question how good the K2 is, and then secondly why 
Poland might want them. Obviously they're going 
with both M1s and K2s. The idea of fielding a multi-type fleet is 
hardly new, indeed Poland is rather used to it. There are a few countries out there which do 
field multiple types of tank. It can be managed. The question of how good 
is K2 is an interesting one. Nobody knows really. Except the Koreans, and 
maybe a few others scattered around the world. It's not as if Hyundai Rotem 
has invited me to go check it out. It's almost impossible to 
find information not found in the sales brochure 
or the marketing blurbs. Which is a bit of a problem for me. As you 
may have noticed from the BEDAR talk 

[00:27:19] I like to use sourced 
information if possible.However, the only practical information 
I've received from a Korean tanker is that he found the K2 to be far 
more comfortable inside than K1 as it had more internal 
volume for crewmen. Probably a result of the reduced crew 
requirements due to the autoloader. I have my own opinions on autoloaders 
and I am very much in favour of them, but that's another video. It's actually called Wither the Autoloader, 
if you want to go look for it. Now I have said in the past that the 
differences between modern tanks are really more in the details 
than in general capabilities. If you look at K2, you're not going 
to find much particularly unexpected from the sales brochure of any modern tank, 
be it Leopard 2A7, or Leclerc, or M1A2 SEPv4. 

[00:28:07] K2 is a modern lethal tank, but no 
more than a modern lethal tank.I mean, look at the weapons. The main 
gun is in effect the Rheinmetall 120/55. As found on later Leopards, it's a NATO 
standard gun firing NATO standard munitions. In practice not much difference 
between that or anything else. Now there are a couple of minor quirks, the 
Koreans have some of their own ammunition. The one getting a lot of attention is 
the Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition, which is in effect a sort of a tank-fired 
version of a BONUS or SADARM type round. Fire in the general direction of 
the enemy, it deploys a parachute, seeks out an armoured target and fires 
an explosively formed projectile into it. Personally, I think it's a waste 
of ammunition space in a tank. I mean, why not just fire that 
type around from a 155mm and save the limited ammunition 
capacity on the tank 

[00:29:01] for things that only a tank can fire, 
specifically direct-fire tank rounds.I mean, if you really want to shoot 
at the top of a tank with your tank because it's thinner, there are 
other ways of doing the job. And I wouldn't be surprised if the 
engineers start pulling the test reports for the XM943 STAFF round 
for example. (Or MRM, or whatever.) Integration with special ammunition types 
should be a standard for ... any modern tank. The M1A2 SEPv4 is designed to be compatible 
with the coming sensor-fused AMP round. Leopard 2A7s have a similar capability. 
Israeli tanks have had APAM for years. The fire control system 
on K2 is similarly capable. Thermal imagers, both for 
the commander and gunner, with all the latest and greatest in zoom 
capability and clarity, I have no doubt. Is the image better than that 
of anything else out there? 

[00:29:54] I've no clue, but I suspect it's good enough.Other features seem to 
include auto-tracking. And most interestingly 
a targeting radar system, which may help with ranging 
to obscure targets, if nothing else. Now I understand that overall 
the fire control system is related to that manufactured by Thales 
and is used in the Leclerc. But again, that's what I'm finding out. But again, realistically though is there 
a practical difference on the ground? I mean at expected combat ranges 
is the K2 going to hit and kill things which can't be hit and killed by the 
latest M1 or Leopard? I suspect not. An interesting question however, 
comes in terms of its protection. K2 is not a particularly heavy tank, but on the 
plus side it also has a somewhat smaller profile. 

[00:30:41] The defensive suite is pretty 
much a customer option list.And depending on how it's configured, 
you'll see that the K2's turret looks different, particularly when it comes to 
sensors and active protection. One of the problems with adding systems 
to a tank after it has been designed is that normally it's not 
a very efficient process. So sticking Trophy on top of an Abrams 
adds a couple of tons to the weight, not least because some ballast needs 
to be added to balance out the turret. It's dead weight in effect. K2 being designed with various defence 
systems in mind, may be more efficient. But weight however is still a factor. And it seems to be one reason why the tank has 
been selected for service alongside the American M1. Now according to Damian Ratka of the Polish 
community (you'll find him online easily enough),",True,False,,,,,0.0,1693701132.0,,False,0.0,{},jyvrtyk,False,t3_z5zd6j,False,t1_jyvrtyk,True,t1_jyvrsaf,/r/Perun/comments/z5zd6j/polish_military_modernisation_why_are_they_buying/jyvrtyk/,,1.0,False,True,False,Perun,t5_684it1,r/Perun,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[00:23:28] most of that increase is intended to be directed

&lt;p&gt;Similar feeling but less traditional/consistently used in English:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finnian, Phineas - Finn/Phin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignatius - Iggy or I guess Nate again actually. However, Ignatius feels more Catholic which Nathaniel doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donovan - quite like Van as a nickname though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leander, Lysander &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alastair (rather than more popular and classic Alexander)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cassius called Cash &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in the situation you describe I would be very tempted by Nathaniel or Dominic, which don&amp;#39;t feel odd but aren&amp;#39;t top 30 names. Zachary and Zach are maybe slightly dad vibes these days rather than baby but I don&amp;#39;t hate that.&lt;/p&gt;

Copy-pasting my previous comment on this:

The indictment's allegations—including its claims about what the chats show—are lies. It's deeply disturbing the utter disregard the authors show for the truth. The basis for their allegations is summarized by this paragraph:

[New Tornado Cash indictments seem to run counter to FinCEN guidance - Our initial thoughts on a case that could potentially criminalize the publication of software code](https://www.coincenter.org/new-tornado-cash-indictments-seem-to-run-counter-to-fincen-guidance/)

&gt;*The allegations include that the defendants: (a) paid for web hosting services for a user interface that allowed users to send transaction messages to the underlying smart contracts, (b) paid for a software repository (Github) where smart contract and user interface software and documentation was hosted, and (c) had (for a time before May 2020) “complete control” over the Tornado Cash smart contracts.*

Paying for Github hosting of open source software, and running a server that serves the HTML/JS of a web interface, that people run locally to interact with a blockchain-based smart-contract, are completely protected under the First Amendment.

The last of the three allegations refers to an admin key that the developers could use to upgrade the smart contract, that they destroyed two years before any alleged criminal use of the smart contract.

The indictment is disingenuous, containing mischaracterizations, contradictions and lies of omission. You can find it here:

[https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-c...](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations)

It first claims they made no modifications to the ""service"" (by which they mean a supposed combination of the web front and the smart contract that the indictment alleges was run by them) to prevent criminal use:

&gt;*STORM and SEMENOV knew about these money laundering transactions and received complaints and requests for help from victims of hacking and other cybercrimes. However, they refused to implement any controls and continued to operate the Tornado Cash service and facilitate these money laundering transactions.*

Then it contradicts itself in acknowledging they did change the ""service"", as they changed the web front to prevent criminal use:

&gt;*They implemented a change in the service so that they could make a public announcement that they were compliant with sanctions, but in their private chats, they agreed that this change would be ineffective.*

But they couch this acknowledgment in an absolutely false/fabricated implicit claim that they deliberately neutered the modification to allow illegal use.

The indictiment follows this with the claim that they proceeded to run their ""service""—by which they refer to the combination of the web front end and the smart contract—to process criminal deposits:

&gt;*They then continued to operate the Tornado Cash service and facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars in further sanctions-violating transactions, helping the Lazarus Group to transfer criminal proceeds from a cryptocurrency wallet that had been designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as blocked property.*

The assertion is that the private chats confirm all of this, which again, is an absolute lie.

The missing context here is that the developers ran a server that served a web front end, that users ran locally to interact with the distributed smart contract.

The chats the indictment reference discuss how even with the filtering they instituted on the front end, bad actors would continue to be able to use the immutable smart contracts, because users were able to switch from using the sanctions-compliant front-end the developers provided, to their own front-end that was not sanctions-compliant.

The chats demonstrate the developers expressing frustration at the fact that criminals would be able to bypass the front end they provided, and continue using the autonomous Tornado Cash smart contract, putting to a lie the claim that 1. they could have done more to prevent criminal use of the smart contract, and 2. that they controlled the ""service""—by which they refer to the web front end and smart contract they allegedly ran—used by criminals. The only uses of any software that they ran—after they implemented the changes the indictment references—were sanctions-compliant ones.

The truth is exactly the opposite of what this indictment claims.

Or you mention creating music videos. Many readers might have problems collecting ideas on how to do that and how to shoot is. Alas, for band photos which are quite important. There might be a separate chapter on how to do them, including too cliché pics like standing on rail tracks in in front of a brick wall.

""You might have an album cover photoshoot."" - what look good and what not? What is cliché, how to compare with streaming services color schemes?  

""Record Better Demos On A Budget"" - there are complete 10-12 hours of courses on youtube about this. 2 pages are not enough to introduce the musician to this hobby.

Damian Las is an amazing prospect who we have been developing in MLS Next Pro (and who was named best goalie this mid season). We’re clearly developing him as Stuver’s replacement but Stuver gives us a reasonably affordable option now while we don’t have a stellar roster. There’s no reason to buy a top goalie right now with the way our roster is underperforming at key spots (DPs). Instead, we are developing Las. 

It sucks to lose, especially after such a great run last year but you can’t just pour money on every position (some due to mls spending rules, some because it’s not wise).

We are struggling to find 4 defenders that we want to field and can stay healthy. Our midfield has young players who are still learning the game. Our strikers have been non existent.

The current top champ (aka the WWE Champion, but they call it the Universal Championship) is Roman Reigns, who is the cousin of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. For the past three and a half years, Roman has been a manipulator and mental abuser to his cousins, The Usos (who are the sons of Rikishi), especially Jey Uso. They formed a dominant faction called ""The Bloodline"" cause they are, in fact, Samoan. Paul Heyman, the guy who used to be a manager to Brock Lesnar, is basically the bitch of Roman. The Usos' younger brother, Solo Sikoa, is also a part of the Bloodline and is basically the silent heavy. A couple of months back, Jey and Jimmy finally left Roman in the dust in one of the greatest segments I've ever seen, but Solo stayed with Roman. Roman and Solo took out Jimmy before Summerslam, and Jey challenged Roman for the title at said show. Match wasn't that well received, but the main thing is that Jimmy returned at Summerslam and ended up costing his brother the match, and everyone was like, ""Why the f*ck would you do this."" On the most recent smackdown, Jimmy said he did it cause he didn't want Jey to be like Roman, but really, he didn't want to be alone cause the Usos are THE tag Team. Jey said ""Nah, f*ck that,"" and beat up Roman, Solo, and Jimmy and then announced that he was leaving WWE which let's be real, is 99% just for the storyline.

On Raw, the current top champ is Seth Rollins (World Heavyweight Championship, it got brought back after being defunct since 2013). Seth is like the Joker, but not really. He dances around a lot and laughs like a Hyena and wears very fancy clothes, but he is very badass and an excellent wrestler. Everyone sings his theme. He and Roman used to be in a 3-man faction called the Shield back in 2014, but Seth betrayed the faction, but that's a story for another time. Seth has been in a feud these past few months with this Faction called the Judgment Day, who are basically a bunch of angry emo kids but are all badass. Finn Balor, an angry Irish lad, is the leader. Damian Priest is a tall, Razor Ramon esque dude who is very good and is Mr. Money in the Bank. Dominik Mysterio, the actual son of Rey mysterio, is a little shithead who everyone boos the crap out of every time he tries to speak and he is also the current NXT North American Champion (NXT is the developmental brand btw if you didn’t know). His ""mami"" is this cool chick named Rhea Ripley, who is a badass dominatrix...trust me she's cool and she's also the current Women's World Heavyweight Champion. Anyways, Judgment Day has sort of been having issues recently as Damian being Mr. Money in the Bank kinda conflicts with Finn Balor's desire to be world champ, and to make matters worse, Damian accidentally cost Balor the title match at Summerslam against Rollins. To make it even worse, Balor is thinking about bringing in his protégé, JD McDonagh, another angry Irish lad, into the Faction. So WWE is kind of setting up the judgment day to he the next Bloodline story (at least we all hope so)

The current United States Champ is Rey Mysterio, who literally just won it a few days ago (at the time of me writing this) from this guy named Austin Theory. Theory is like a jock who thinks he's the shit but actually isn't and is kind of bland, but we all know he can be more. Rey is also the leader of a brand new version of the Lation World Order from WCW days.

The current Intercontinental Champ is this Austrian guy named Gunther. He's real mean, intimidating, and a heel, but everyone loves him cause he is a very good wrestler and makes the Intercontinental feel important. He is most likely going to break the Honky Tonk Man's record for longest Intercontinental title reign. Gunther is also the head of a Faction called Imperium with his two cronies, Giovanni Vinci &amp; Ludwig Kaiser, who are actually pretty good wrestlers. (Side note:Gunther chops people like the Big Show but it is much better and it is awesome)

The current WWE Women's Champion is this Japanese wrestler named Iyo Sky (Sidenote:The raw version of the Women's belt is called the world Heavyweight Women's Championship while the smackdown version is called the WWE Women's Championship. Why did they decide this? Idk). Iyo cashed in her MITB briefcase at Summerslam to win the title and everyone was happy. (BTW the women have their own MITB now). Iyo has two buddies with her named Bayley and Dakota Kai. They are supposed to be heels but we love them.

The current Tag Team Champions are Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens...I think? The reason I say this is because Kevin is injured but Sami still carries around the titles so I'm not really sure. But the important part is that Zayn and Owens were key players in the Bloodline storyline a year ago to April of this year. Long story short, Roman fought Kevin back in 2020/2021 and beat him bad. They hated each other. Sami wasn't doing anything for the majority of the time so tried to join the Bloodline and actually did and he felt like he was apart of the family (the only person who didn't like him joining the Bloodline was Jey Uso but Sami eventually won him over). It all started to come crashing down when Roman once again started feuding with Kevin Owens and Sami was conflicted as he and Owens literally go back decades and are like brothers. Zaym turned on Roman eventually which everyone was happy about. Challenged him for the universal championship and lost but then he and Kevin faced the Usos at wrestlemania for the tag titles and won and have held them ever since.

There are Women's Tag Team titles now but WWE doesn't treat them with respect and they hop potato the title around alot and one of the current Champs just got injured so I have no idea what they're going to do with them now. They should just retire them in my opinion.

That's all the main title stuff. I'm not going to go into NXT cause that would make this longer than it already is. Speedround on some other important people

Cody Rhodes is the top baby face besides Seth Rollins and he is like John Cena but we actually like him. Everyone sings his theme. He just got finished with a feud with Brock Lesnar. Yes, THAT Brock Lesnar. Brock shows up from time to time.

Becky Lynch is one of the top women in WWE right now. She's Irish and an asskicker, so everyone calls her the Irish Lasskicker. She's currently in a rivalry with Trish Stratus. Yes, THAT is Trish Stratus. She's still got it but is also the bad guy in this scenario. Trish has a protégé named Zoey Stark, who is also good.

Edge came back in 2020 and appears sporadically. He is going to fight a big angry Irish lad named Sheamus. Sheamus is great, underrated as f\*ck. He's got two homies with him.

Raquel Gonzales is a strong female wrestler who likes showing off her back for some reason. In a rivalry with Rhea Ripley, but may or may not be storyline injured at the moment but will fight Rhea when she comes back.

Charlotte is the daughter of Ric Flair. People are sick of her cause she keeps getting title shots and winning, but she is a good wrestler. 15 time women's champ.

Asuka is the former WWE Women's Champion and is a little playful psycho that we all love.

Bianca Belair is the ""EST"" of the WWE. She held the women's title for about a year, but everyone got sick of it cause she was starting to seem like the female John Cena, but we still loved her. She is very athletic, strong, and badass and uses her hair to whip people. Needs to turn heel imo.

The Alpha Academy is comprised of Chad Gable, Otis, and Maxine Duprii. They are a bunch of goobers that everyone loves, including me. Chad is basically a mini Kurt angle and is very good and extremely funny. He is challenging Gunther for his Intercontinental title on the next raw as of me writing this. Otis is a beefy dude who loves eating and gyrating his hips. Maxine is cool, too.

The New Day is one of the greatest tag teams of this generation comprised of Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E. Big E is currently injured (get well soon). They are hilarious, and everyone loves them.

AJ Styles is one the greatest wrestlers of all time, in my opinion. Former WWE Champ. Currently stuck in mid to lower card feuds, and he deserves more.

Shinsuke Nakamura is a Japanese wrestler who hits really hard but not as hard as some would like cause he has to adhere to the WWE style. He is cool and looks like he is about to feud with Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Title.

Ricochet is a flippy dude who does cool flips, and I love him.

Logan Paul is a wrestler now.

And last but not least is L-A-KNIGHT YEAH! LA Knight is basically like The Rock, which is not a bad thing. This guy has charisma in droves, and he gets the loudest cheers on any show he is on.

For the past three and a half years, Roman has been a manipulator and mental abuser to his cousins, The Usos (who are the sons of Rikishi), especially Jey Uso. They formed a dominant faction called &amp;quot;The Bloodline&amp;quot; cause they are, in fact, Samoan. Paul Heyman, the guy who used to be a manager to Brock Lesnar, is basically the bitch of Roman. The Usos&amp;#39; younger brother, Solo Sikoa, is also a part of the Bloodline and is basically the silent heavy. A couple of months back, Jey and Jimmy finally left Roman in the dust in one of the greatest segments I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, but Solo stayed with Roman. Roman and Solo took out Jimmy before Summerslam, and Jey challenged Roman for the title at said show. Match wasn&amp;#39;t that well received, but the main thing is that Jimmy returned at Summerslam and ended up costing his brother the match, and everyone was like, &amp;quot;Why the f&lt;em&gt;ck would you do this.&amp;quot; On the most recent smackdown, Jimmy said he did it cause he didn&amp;#39;t want Jey to be like Roman, but really, he didn&amp;#39;t want to be alone cause the Usos are THE tag Team. Jey said &amp;quot;Nah, f&lt;/em&gt;ck that,&amp;quot; and beat up Roman, Solo, and Jimmy and then announced that he was leaving WWE which let&amp;#39;s be real, is 99% just for the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Raw, the current top champ is Seth Rollins (World Heavyweight Championship, it got brought back after being defunct since 2013). Seth is like the Joker, but not really. He dances around a lot and laughs like a Hyena and wears very fancy clothes, but he is very badass and an excellent wrestler. Everyone sings his theme. He and Roman used to be in a 3-man faction called the Shield back in 2014, but Seth betrayed the faction, but that&amp;#39;s a story for another time. Seth has been in a feud these past few months with this Faction called the Judgment Day, who are basically a bunch of angry emo kids but are all badass. Finn Balor, an angry Irish lad, is the leader. Damian Priest is a tall, Razor Ramon esque dude who is very good and is Mr. Money in the Bank. Dominik Mysterio, the actual son of Rey mysterio, is a little shithead who everyone boos the crap out of every time he tries to speak and he is also the current NXT North American Champion (NXT is the developmental brand btw if you didn’t know). His &amp;quot;mami&amp;quot; is this cool chick named Rhea Ripley, who is a badass dominatrix...trust me she&amp;#39;s cool and she&amp;#39;s also the current Women&amp;#39;s World Heavyweight Champion. Anyways, Judgment Day has sort of been having issues recently as Damian being Mr. Money in the Bank kinda conflicts with Finn Balor&amp;#39;s desire to be world champ, and to make matters worse, Damian accidentally cost Balor the title match at Summerslam against Rollins. To make it even worse, Balor is thinking about bringing in his protégé, JD McDonagh, another angry Irish lad, into the Faction. So WWE is kind of setting up the judgment day to he the next Bloodline story (at least we all hope so)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current United States Champ is Rey Mysterio, who literally just won it a few days ago (at the time of me writing this) from this guy named Austin Theory. Theory is like a jock who thinks he&amp;#39;s the shit but actually isn&amp;#39;t and is kind of bland, but we all know he can be more. Rey is also the leader of a brand new version of the Lation World Order from WCW days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Intercontinental Champ is this Austrian guy named Gunther. He&amp;#39;s real mean, intimidating, and a heel, but everyone loves him cause he is a very good wrestler and makes the Intercontinental feel important. He is most likely going to break the Honky Tonk Man&amp;#39;s record for longest Intercontinental title reign. Gunther is also the head of a Faction called Imperium with his two cronies, Giovanni Vinci &amp;amp; Ludwig Kaiser, who are actually pretty good wrestlers. (Side note:Gunther chops people like the Big Show but it is much better and it is awesome)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current WWE Women&amp;#39;s Champion is this Japanese wrestler named Iyo Sky (Sidenote:The raw version of the Women&amp;#39;s belt is called the world Heavyweight Women&amp;#39;s Championship while the smackdown version is called the WWE Women&amp;#39;s Championship. Why did they decide this? Idk). Iyo cashed in her MITB briefcase at Summerslam to win the title and everyone was happy. (BTW the women have their own MITB now). Iyo has two buddies with her named Bayley and Dakota Kai. They are supposed to be heels but we love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Tag Team Champions are Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens...I think? The reason I say this is because Kevin is injured but Sami still carries around the titles so I&amp;#39;m not really sure. But the important part is that Zayn and Owens were key players in the Bloodline storyline a year ago to April of this year. Long story short, Roman fought Kevin back in 2020/2021 and beat him bad. They hated each other. Sami wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything for the majority of the time so tried to join the Bloodline and actually did and he felt like he was apart of the family (the only person who didn&amp;#39;t like him joining the Bloodline was Jey Uso but Sami eventually won him over). It all started to come crashing down when Roman once again started feuding with Kevin Owens and Sami was conflicted as he and Owens literally go back decades and are like brothers. Zaym turned on Roman eventually which everyone was happy about. Challenged him for the universal championship and lost but then he and Kevin faced the Usos at wrestlemania for the tag titles and won and have held them ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are Women&amp;#39;s Tag Team titles now but WWE doesn&amp;#39;t treat them with respect and they hop potato the title around alot and one of the current Champs just got injured so I have no idea what they&amp;#39;re going to do with them now. They should just retire them in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all the main title stuff. I&amp;#39;m not going to go into NXT cause that would make this longer than it already is. Speedround on some other important people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cody Rhodes is the top baby face besides Seth Rollins and he is like John Cena but we actually like him. Everyone sings his theme. He just got finished with a feud with Brock Lesnar. Yes, THAT Brock Lesnar. Brock shows up from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becky Lynch is one of the top women in WWE right now. She&amp;#39;s Irish and an asskicker, so everyone calls her the Irish Lasskicker. She&amp;#39;s currently in a rivalry with Trish Stratus. Yes, THAT is Trish Stratus. She&amp;#39;s still got it but is also the bad guy in this scenario. Trish has a protégé named Zoey Stark, who is also good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edge came back in 2020 and appears sporadically. He is going to fight a big angry Irish lad named Sheamus. Sheamus is great, underrated as f*ck. He&amp;#39;s got two homies with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raquel Gonzales is a strong female wrestler who likes showing off her back for some reason. In a rivalry with Rhea Ripley, but may or may not be storyline injured at the moment but will fight Rhea when she comes back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlotte is the daughter of Ric Flair. People are sick of her cause she keeps getting title shots and winning, but she is a good wrestler. 15 time women&amp;#39;s champ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asuka is the former WWE Women&amp;#39;s Champion and is a little playful psycho that we all love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bianca Belair is the &amp;quot;EST&amp;quot; of the WWE. She held the women&amp;#39;s title for about a year, but everyone got sick of it cause she was starting to seem like the female John Cena, but we still loved her. She is very athletic, strong, and badass and uses her hair to whip people. Needs to turn heel imo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Academy is comprised of Chad Gable, Otis, and Maxine Duprii. They are a bunch of goobers that everyone loves, including me. Chad is basically a mini Kurt angle and is very good and extremely funny. He is challenging Gunther for his Intercontinental title on the next raw as of me writing this. Otis is a beefy dude who loves eating and gyrating his hips. Maxine is cool, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Day is one of the greatest tag teams of this generation comprised of Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E. Big E is currently injured (get well soon). They are hilarious, and everyone loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ Styles is one the greatest wrestlers of all time, in my opinion. Former WWE Champ. Currently stuck in mid to lower card feuds, and he deserves more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shinsuke Nakamura is a Japanese wrestler who hits really hard but not as hard as some would like cause he has to adhere to the WWE style. He is cool and looks like he is about to feud with Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricochet is a flippy dude who does cool flips, and I love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logan Paul is a wrestler now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least is L-A-KNIGHT YEAH! LA Knight is basically like The Rock, which is not a bad thing. This guy has charisma in droves, and he gets the loudest cheers on any show he is on. He needs to win a title ASAP! YEAH!&lt;/p&gt;

[],False,,SubservantSnoopDogg,,,,[],,,,text,t2_ys8dv,False,False,"I would put the highly underrated Prey right after Year One. It fleshed out Catwoman a little, his relationship with the GCPD, and introduces Hugo Strange as a first grounded villain. Totally agree on the others though.

after Dark Victory, there's sort of a break in terms of ""comprehensive coverage"" of Batman's career-- those stories take you up to about year three or four, then year eightish picks up with the ongoing Batman comics issue #401 on, with some of the key stories such as The Cult, Ten Nights of the Beast, Death in the Family, and The Killing Joke, being moderately to very easy to get in paperbacks. Issue #401 includes the original publication of Year One, sort of placed like a flashback, but the ""present"" deals with Jason Todd's time as Robin, and if you continue through Batman comics and Detective Comics from that era, it will bring you all the way up through Tim Drake, Knightfall (Bane,) Contagion, No Man's Land, War Games, Damian Wayne and so on,  ""as it's happening.""

As for stories in Batman's early-middle career (year four-sevenish) with Dick Grayson as Robin, DC didn't really feel a need to flesh that out as there were already forty years of stories with him, and the stories featuring his late teens in the seventies (before the reboot that encouraged Year One)  still had a degree of relevance and maturity. So, as was their company policy, they encouraged fans to consider comics from the seventies and earlier to be ""Apocryphal"" meaning,

 ""Something very similar to these events happened, save for contradicting details  that came later, just use your imagination to fix those and you can read them too.""

So if you read a seventies Batman/Robin/Batgirl story you need only ignore that he says he caught Joe Chill, and fill in that a similar version of that story is true, where he didn't mention catching Joe Chill.

DC never filled in much of the ""Dynamic Duo"" era for New Earth, however, the currently ongoing ""World's Finest "" series does a really good job of covering that time, once again ""Apocryphally."" There might be some contradictions to Dark Victory and company, but the current continuity policy is basically ""everything is canon due to timeline meddling; some characters remember different timelines.""

There are, however, a few other stories filling in his first two years, mostly from the Legends of the Dark Knight series from the '90s, such as the aforementioned Prey. These are fairly easy to read out of order and don't take much connective work, and there are other stories in this timeframe, also published post Year One (but not all after Long Halloween, which was also a massive redefinition, so there will be some contradictions) like Four of a Kind, which collects some villain origins, Mad Monk and Monster Men, which loosely modernize golden age Batman stories and follow details from Year One, and Scarecrow: Year One.

So what I'd recommend, though I'm sure others would disagree:

Batman: Year One

Batman: The Mad Monk

Batman: The Monster Men

Batman: Four of a Kind

Batman: The Man Who Laughs

Batman: The Long Halloween

Like I said to another person, a huge part of what makes the difference to me is the sufficiency and significance of what’s specific. With something Leonardo VS Jay from Ninjago, for example, the only specific thing would be that they wear blue. It’s a simply aesthetic thing that would bind them specifically, and there’s nothing that makes it any significantly more thematic than any turtle vs any other ninja.

It’s technically true that you could match up any Robin against any turtle and at least get something resembling a theme, but Donnie VS Tim is significantly more specific to a point that I think justifies it. 


Like I said in another comment, a big thing Tim and Donnie have that none of the other turtles or Robins (or hell, even Peter) have is specifically that their intelligence serves as compensation for their lack of physicality relative to their peers, in most timelines for both characters, they are explicitly the weakest Robin and Turtle respectively. Their intelligence isn’t just a key part of their character because it means they’re both smart, it’s also a key part of their characters because it’s the very tenet that allows them to keep up in a world where they’d otherwise be totally outmatched. Contrast that with Peter who is smart, yes, but is also incredibly physically powerful and only ever struggles because he holds back. Consider Superior Spider-Man where Doc Ock ends up in Peter’s body and demolishes everyone and everything in his path because he doesn’t restrict himself like Peter does for example.

Peter VS Donnie is objectively more thematic than the rest of the turtles, but not to the point where you actually feel like you’re losing much by going with another turtle. Both Peter VS Leo and Mikey VS Damian Wayne still have some of the connections you get from Donnie VS Tim/Peter, but I feel like with the latter you lose significantly more than with the former.

TLDR: Donnie VS Tim’s specificity is better than VS Peter’s because Donnie VS Tim’s specificity runs deeper into Donnie’s character.

&lt;p&gt;It’s technically true that you could match up any Robin against any turtle and at least get something resembling a theme, but Donnie VS Tim is significantly more specific to a point that I think justifies it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said in another comment, a big thing Tim and Donnie have that none of the other turtles or Robins (or hell, even Peter) have is specifically that their intelligence serves as compensation for their lack of physicality relative to their peers, in most timelines for both characters, they are explicitly the weakest Robin and Turtle respectively. Their intelligence isn’t just a key part of their character because it means they’re both smart, it’s also a key part of their characters because it’s the very tenet that allows them to keep up in a world where they’d otherwise be totally outmatched. Contrast that with Peter who is smart, yes, but is also incredibly physically powerful and only ever struggles because he holds back. Consider Superior Spider-Man where Doc Ock ends up in Peter’s body and demolishes everyone and everything in his path because he doesn’t restrict himself like Peter does for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter VS Donnie is objectively more thematic than the rest of the turtles, but not to the point where you actually feel like you’re losing much by going with another turtle. Both Peter VS Leo and Mikey VS Damian Wayne still have some of the connections you get from Donnie VS Tim/Peter, but I feel like with the latter you lose significantly more than with the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Donnie VS Tim’s specificity is better than VS Peter’s because Donnie VS Tim’s specificity runs deeper into Donnie’s character. You get significantly more theming out of Donnie VS Tim than you do out of Random Turtle VS Random Robin.&lt;/p&gt;

According to IOL Sport's information ahead of the squad announcement on Tuesday in Johannesburg, it looks like flyhalf Handre Pollard, centre Lukhanyo Am, lock Lood de Jager and scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies will not form part of the squad heading to France to defend their title.

That means Manie Libbok could be the only recognised flyhalf, while some shifts could come in the midfield to make up for the loss of Am.

Pollard hasn't played any rugby since injuring his calf at his English Premiership club Leicester Tigers, although he had some training with the Boks. It's a recurring injury, though, and it's set to keep him out of the tournament.

Am injured his knee this past Saturday against Argentina, and it's worse than what was anticipated. In the tackle on him, his knee twisted and although he tried to soldier on in the game, he was replaced shortly after the injury.

De Jager will miss France 2023 due to illness. He was set to play against Los Pumas in Buenos Aires, but had to be withdrawn after being ‘a bit chesty’ according to Bok coach Jacques Nienaber. His illness is also more serious than what was expected.

Nienaber will name his 33-man squad on Tuesday afternoon and it looks like Jantjies, who burst onto the scene shortly before the 2019 World Cup, is one of the scrumhalfs to miss out on selection.

He was unlucky to only get game time in Argentina where he had a decent cameo off the bench. But with the rise of Grant Williams and Jaden Hendrikse and the experience of Faf de Klerk and Cobus Reinach as number 9's, it was always going to be tough for the Stormers' nippy scrumhalf to crack the nod.

Lock Marvin Orie, who enjoyed some valuable minutes in the Rugby Championship, and the warmup against Argentina, looks set to replace De Jager, while Andre Esterhuizen could be a shoe-in to replace Am with Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel able to cover outside centre if needed.


The absence of key players will be a big blow for Boks as they look to successfully defend their title, but Nienaber and his management made sure to give those players who will be in the squad enough game time to successfully slot into the roles of the players set to miss out.

Some background. Stuff eventually came out that painted some simmering conflicts predominantly between kawhi Leonard's manager/uncle and the front office even before this. Leonard had reportedly begun to be frustrated with San Antonio's low key approach to managing their stars. Several times him and his uncle pointed to other franchises in regards to how they advertise their star towards the Spurs more or less kind of just shrugged and let him know that wasn't really how they rolled

Uncle Dennis, at one point tried to get himself a front office position to which the Spurs as an organization more or less left at him and told him that's not how this works. You can't just demand those things

With that, out of the way. Kawhi Leonard suffered an injury in the playoffs. Early in the rehab process, San Antonio diagnosed it as a injury that had resulted from a chronic degenerative condition.

Kawhi Leonard and his camp very aggressively rejected this diagnosis. San Antonio didn't want any drama so they allowed him to seek a second medical opinion. And that second doctor confirmed the Spurs diagnosis

It was around this time that rumblings. Begin to happen that Leonard had confided in close confidence that he was planning on leaving the Spurs for the Lakers as soon as he could and wanted to return home to California

At this point. Leonard continued to reject the diagnosis of both medical teams and informed the spurs he would be handling his rehab on his own away from the team

This confused the Spurs players. They were a 60 win team the year before and had improved. The consensus was they were one of the top contenders in the league and the players were a bit confused as to why he was removing himself from the team and refusing to answer questions from the media or the Spurs themselves about when he would report back to the team

So Leonard went out and actually ended up getting at the very least two more medical diagnosis (there were rumors that the amount of professionals he consulted numbered up to 7 plus but I at least know that he for sure spoke with three not including the Spurs) That again confirmed the Spurs diagnosis on his chronic degenerative condition

At this point San Antonio requested he come back so they could begin working on a long-term management program. They weren't trying to get him to jump right into games. They were trying to get him to start working with a team so they could understand where his pain, tolerance and condition was. In regards to the issue. It wasn't something that was going to just go away. It was going to need long-term management and without him there there's no way they could start coming up with a plan for him

But Leonard and his uncle continued the BS and retreated to New York. Greg popovich infamously flew out there to see him and Leonard didn't answer any of his calls and then both him and then his team literally moved him to a different room under a different name. So when pop and the Spurs got there they wouldn't be able to speak with him

Real freaking middle school bs

Around this time the Spurs players finally got fed up with the lack of clarity on what was going on. They called a player's only meeting and grilled him on how he was feeling why he wasn't working with the team, if he thought he was going to come back etc etc

Leonard denied the diagnosis again, and left a meeting without giving any idea if he planned on trying to work to come back this season

Just led to Tony Parker making his come out widely blown out of proportion, comments about how he had had a similar situation the year before but that is injury was worse but he was willing to work with San Antonio and that's why he had come back and was able to play

Leonard and his camp absolutely blew this up. Chris Haynes, a friend of Uncle Dennis, ran this through the media and started perpetuate all these ideas that San Antonio was essentially gaslighting. Gaslighting Leonard and trying to trick him into suiting up and playing injured

The spurs again reached out to him trying to get him and his medical team to come back and work with them, but at this point, in an attempt to keep his chronic condition out of the spotlight, Leonard and his uncle had gone to a point of no return and requested a trade

That bounced around and bubbled around for a little bit but after meeting with the Spurs San Antonio told him they would honor his request but that they were going to do what was best for the organization since they were a older team and they needed to get back value to maintain their ability to compete

Leonard and his uncle responded by announcing in the media that he wanted to go to LA and LA alone

The Spurs made a statement essentially saying that they were going to again do what was in the best interest of the team and they wanted to find a middle ground between the two parties but he would be traded to the team that offered the best package

At this point Leonard and his camp released to the media through Chris Haynes that if any team besides one from LA traded for him, he would not resign and eave them for Los Angeles

If this was a situation like Damian Lillard it wouldn't have been as big of a deal so it still would have sucked

But this absolutely screwed San Antonio as kawhi Leonard had missed the entire year with injury, and injury that at the time the general NBA world was still very confused about since both parties were saying different things, had only one year left on his deal, and had publicly specified exactly where he was going

To say trading for him was a risk is a huge understatement

The Spurs continue to do their thing fielding offers, which reportedly were extremely poor, and did a final act of desperation. Chris Haynes leaked that Leonard was willing to sit out the final year of his deal if needed if he wasn't treated too the Lakers

San Antonio ended up getting a relatively mediocre return for him, the raptors ended up doing exactly what San Antonio wanted to do, which is load, manage him and only play him at times where he fell up for it, and history has shown that indeed his degenerative condition is real, has caused multiple subsequent injuries as a result, and that the man is just never going to be the same",True,False,,,,,0.0,1690689901.0,,False,0.0,{},ju17ae3,False,t3_15dba77,False,t1_ju17ae3,True,t3_15dba77,/r/NBASpurs/comments/15dba77/can_someone_explain_what_kawhi_did_to_the_spurs/ju17ae3/,,35.0,False,True,False,NBASpurs,t5_2s53b,r/NBASpurs,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,35.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy and pasting this from a fight I got in with a hater about this subject earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confused the Spurs players. They were a 60 win team the year before and had improved. The consensus was they were one of the top contenders in the league and the players were a bit confused as to why he was removing himself from the team and refusing to answer questions from the media or the Spurs themselves about when he would report back to the team&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Leonard went out and actually ended up getting at the very least two more medical diagnosis (there were rumors that the amount of professionals he consulted numbered up to 7 plus but I at least know that he for sure spoke with three not including the Spurs) That again confirmed the Spurs diagnosis on his chronic degenerative condition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point San Antonio requested he come back so they could begin working on a long-term management program. They weren&amp;#39;t trying to get him to jump right into games. They were trying to get him to start working with a team so they could understand where his pain, tolerance and condition was. In regards to the issue. It wasn&amp;#39;t something that was going to just go away. It was going to need long-term management and without him there there&amp;#39;s no way they could start coming up with a plan for him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Leonard and his uncle continued the BS and retreated to New York. Greg popovich infamously flew out there to see him and Leonard didn&amp;#39;t answer any of his calls and then both him and then his team literally moved him to a different room under a different name. So when pop and the Spurs got there they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to speak with him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real freaking middle school bs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time the Spurs players finally got fed up with the lack of clarity on what was going on. They called a player&amp;#39;s only meeting and grilled him on how he was feeling why he wasn&amp;#39;t working with the team, if he thought he was going to come back etc etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard denied the diagnosis again, and left a meeting without giving any idea if he planned on trying to work to come back this season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just led to Tony Parker making his come out widely blown out of proportion, comments about how he had had a similar situation the year before but that is injury was worse but he was willing to work with San Antonio and that&amp;#39;s why he had come back and was able to play&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard and his camp absolutely blew this up. Chris Haynes, a friend of Uncle Dennis, ran this through the media and started perpetuate all these ideas that San Antonio was essentially gaslighting. Gaslighting Leonard and trying to trick him into suiting up and playing injured&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spurs again reached out to him trying to get him and his medical team to come back and work with them, but at this point, in an attempt to keep his chronic condition out of the spotlight, Leonard and his uncle had gone to a point of no return and requested a trade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bounced around and bubbled around for a little bit but after meeting with the Spurs San Antonio told him they would honor his request but that they were going to do what was best for the organization since they were a older team and they needed to get back value to maintain their ability to compete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonard and his uncle responded by announcing in the media that he wanted to go to LA and LA alone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spurs made a statement essentially saying that they were going to again do what was in the best interest of the team and they wanted to find a middle ground between the two parties but he would be traded to the team that offered the best package&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point Leonard and his camp released to the media through Chris Haynes that if any team besides one from LA traded for him, he would not resign and eave them for Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this was a situation like Damian Lillard it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been as big of a deal so it still would have sucked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this absolutely screwed San Antonio as kawhi Leonard had missed the entire year with injury, and injury that at the time the general NBA world was still very confused about since both parties were saying different things, had only one year left on his deal, and had publicly specified exactly where he was going&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say trading for him was a risk is a huge understatement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spurs continue to do their thing fielding offers, which reportedly were extremely poor, and did a final act of desperation. Chris Haynes leaked that Leonard was willing to sit out the final year of his deal if needed if he wasn&amp;#39;t treated too the Lakers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Antonio ended up getting a relatively mediocre return for him, the raptors ended up doing exactly what San Antonio wanted to do, which is load, manage him and only play him at times where he fell up for it, and history has shown that indeed his degenerative condition is real, has caused multiple subsequent injuries as a result, and that the man is just never going to be the same&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing can spoil the Nuggets' championship summer bliss, but losing Bruce Brown and Jeff Green in free agency are blows to their title defense. Brown was an integral part of their championship run, and his versatility will be missed. Green's veteran experience, especially in the locker room, will also be difficult to replace. The Nuggets re-signed Reggie Jackson with hopes that he will play a bigger role off the bench.

The Bucks were successful in keeping their core together this summer, bringing back both Brook Lopez and Khris Middleton on multi-year deals to run it back with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday, but with a new coach at the helm.

Few teams made more dramatic swings this summer than the Celtics signing Jaylen Brown to a historic max contract and swapping Marcus Smart, long the heart-and-soul of the roster, for Kristaps Porzingis. The move raises Boston's championship ceiling, giving it a totally different look offensively than it had before and creating a completely different dynamic within the team.

The Suns have as skilled of a Big 3 as you'll find in the league in Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker. Do they have the depth of a champion, though?

Even purely political 'cults' - avowedly atheist-secular, anti-'superstition' (help stamp out wrong beliefs NOW)

Per Campbell, a 'blessed tie' that binds them all is - 'common descent' from a historically emergent subcultural ""seedbed"" and of drastic dark fertility. Akin to HPL's malign ""black goat of the wood with her thousand young""(?). Each 'group' but one lesion at the surface among so many visibly multiplying, from an underlying 'disease process' that goes to the bone. Continually spawning endlessly varied 'snowflake' variants - cranking away 24/7, always 'on' (with no 'off' switch).

&gt; I found psychedelics disappointing. They provided glimpses of states which seemed far more right than my usual state, and seemed similar to better states during childhood, before bad things happened. But they didn't seem healing, and maybe even seemed counter-productive and escapist.

&gt; ...I guess the main issue was the habitual limitations which remained uncrossed. Psychedelics helped me find a healthier seeming state within those, but didn't help me go beyond that. I still don't fully understand why.

[],False,,BvHauteville,,,,[],,,,text,t2_k82jzryx,False,False,"Well, there is something we can go by.

We find the Hunter's Mark, a sign of the Moon Presence, scattered throughout the Pthumerian Labryinth.

There's even an alternate variation of the Altar we fight Queen Yharnam next to with the top missing and the Hunter's Mark present.

Queen Yharnam is, of course, highly associated with the Vilebloods with her too having corrupted blood given her ability to deal rapid poison similar to the transformed Chikage when swathed in the blood of a Vileblood. We also obtain the Blood Rapture Rune from both the Shadows of Yharnam and the Bloody Crow of Cainhurst with the text for said rune being equally applicable to both Queen Yharnam and Queen Analise.

The Cainhurst Hunters we can encounter in the Chalice Dungeons can also apparently shout ""Blood for the Blood Rapture"" in additon to line such as ""Blood for the Queen!"" and ""Blood for the Child of Blood!"" even if I personally haven't heard these lines in my encounters with them.

It's also commonly though the ""forbidden blood"" supplied to Cainhurst was that of Queen Yharnam which reinvigorated their dwindling Pthumerian heritage and powers. Both Queen Analise and Queen Yharnam possess a form of immortality, as well, given the description for the Yharnam Stone. Since all Vilebloods imbide in the now corrupted blood of Queen Analise, perhaps that's where the Chikage's rapid poison stems from. Even the player must imbibe in Analise's blood to obtain the weapon regularly.

The only non-Vileblood (well, besides the Bloody Crow of Cainhurst whose connection to Cainhurst is pretty easily inferred even if Queen Analise doesn't acknowledge his existence) to wield the Chikage, Yamamura, seems to be coded to never use its transformed mode under any circumstances.

There are Lost and Uncanny variations of the weapon you can obtain from the Chalice Dungeons without becoming a Vileblood, yourself, but perhaps one can headcanon that away by pointing out those weapons were already perhaps pre-used and corrupted by the blood of their previous owners.

Either that or just chalk it up to something of a gameplay mechanic. After all, doesn't it kinda feel funny that we can purchase alternative versions of the Holy Moonlight Sword, a rather special weapon by any definition, in the Chalice Dungeons or find alternative Uncanny and Lost versions of the Blades of Mercy and Burial Blade in said Chalice Dungeons despite the fact that they were distinctly crafted via a special metal obtained from a meteorite and are referred to as masterpieces of the workshop (at least the Burial Blade is whereas the Blades of Mercy are instead described as one of the oldest weapons of the workshop)?

The only member of Cainhurst nobility whose blood specifically doesn't deal poison is Maria but considering she absconded with Gehrman to become a Hunter and always had a disdain for blood blades, I think we can infer she never imbibed in Queen Analise's blood.

It is, however, commonly thought that Oedon was the one to impregnate Queen Yharnam and the Umbilical Cord for Arianna points out that corrupted blood began the eldritch liaison between Oedon and Arianna. Ironically, perhaps corrupted blood is exactly what attracted Oedon's attention in the first place.

Perhaps the reason we find Queen Yharnam in shackles and bleeding from her stomach is because her followers turned on her after discovering her newfound connection with Oedon rather than the Moon Presence. The Blood Rapture Rune, does talk about how the Queen's servants were always hoping to imbibe in her blood just as the servants of Analise seek her own blood as a reward for presenting Blood Dregs.

I've also been of the opinion that the conflict between Cainhurst and the Executioners predates modern times by quite a bit considering other aspects of Cainhurst linking it to Pthumerian civilization, such as the presence of antiques in the Cainhurst dining hall we otherwise find in Chalice Dungeon treasure rooms in addition to the presence of the Lost Children of Antiquity - the Gargoyles - only in Cainhurst and in the Chalice Dungeons, and the fact that Martyr Logarius is clearly a descendent of the Pthumerians.

The Executioner's Garb also very clearly has the Hunter's Mark inscribed on its chest, which may point to further allegiance to the Moon Presence in contrast to Oedon or whatever higher entity the Vilebloods chiefly serve.

Of course, the Executioner Garb was the basis for all future Church attire so Church philosophy could have changed a lot since then. The School of Mensis obviously has no problem abducting Choir Members and Church Hunters, sending their Damian of Mensis to murder Rom and Ebrietas, and also contacting the stillborn Mergo who was very likely the child of Oedon.

I doubt the School was always in such opposition to the regular Church Hierarchy to the point Edgar would be sent in as a spy on behalf of the Choir to gain answers as to what they were up to. It's also worth mentioning that the Choir, itself, was a recent invention of sorts made up of all scholars raised in the Orphanage according to the Orphanage Key.

Funnily, enough, the Orphange Key literally mentions a split in the Healing Church via the following line in its description

*The Choir, that would later split the Healing Church, was a creation of the Orphanage.*

But, of course, a lot of this is just rambling which brings up likely more questions than answers.

Why allow the presence of Oedon Chapel near Cathedral Ward which was once connected to the Abandoned Workshop? Was it just a front? A requestioned building the Church didn't care much about as it pertained to its original purpose as a house of worship? Who knows?

And how did Queen Yharnam's blood originally become corrupt? In the Paleblood Hunt, Redgrave goes into great detail as to how the origin of all poison in the game is likely the result of Vermin. The Headless Bloodletting Beast, with a massive Vermin infesting it, even shoots out a stream of winged maggots and blood which deal rapid posion just as Queen Yharnam's blood does. What led to Queen Yharnam ingesting Vermin if she did at all?

&gt; “IPWUK were running their ‘Weekend of Champions’ event in Tonbridge.

&gt; I worked for IPW at the time, so I was at both shows that weekend, as well as the after party. By this time, it had become almost routine for Daniel Edler to constantly purchase me drinks at these events, so I was incredibly drunk. Especially for a 16 year old.

&gt; Later on in the night, I bumped into Marty outside of the party venue. He spent a while saying to me that ‘we should go back together, let’s go back to the hotel, let’s f*ck’. I told him, ‘I don’t have a key for my hotel room, my friend has the only one’.

&gt; I remember that I did actually go inside and tell that friend that I was about to head off with Marty, but she wouldn’t give me the keys because she thought it was a bad idea. Despite knowing I couldn’t get into my hotel room, he walked me back to my hotel. For context, it was kind of an independent, small hotel.

&gt; Once we got outside my room, in this empty, quiet hallway, he sat on a chair and got his penis out and told me to suck it. So I did. After a little while he found a cupboard opposite my room, full of sheets. He took me in there and got me to stand up, with my underwear pulled down. Remember, I’m 16 at this time.

&gt; The whole time that he was getting me into position to stick his unprotected penis inside me, I was repeatedly saying ‘I’m so sorry I’m a virgin’ (Disclaimer: I had actually been raped by Dan Edler before this point, which I’ve detailed over and over in the past to the public and the police. But I personally still considered myself to have my virginity up until April that year).

&gt; Before he had even had the chance to penetrate me, the aforementioned friend turned up and told him to leave. The next day he didn’t turn up for his match. Everyone there knew that we had kissed, so it was quickly circulating that I was a slut. But not the part where he sexually assaulted a drunk child. After this, Dan Edler said he’d never book him again. Because he considered me his girlfriend and he was jealous that something happened between me and another man. But that’s a separate thing.”

[],False,,BigBallsMalone,,,,[],,,,text,t2_gklvltie,False,False,"NO TEAM ARRIVES at the crossroads the Portland Trail Blazers face now because of a single recent decision -- in this case Portland using the No. 3 pick on Scoot Henderson instead of trading the pick to appease Damian Lillard.  
  
The Blazers' front office was sincere in its belief it could straddle two paths -- take Henderson, and work trades and free agency to build a competitive team around Lillard. It would be hard, and require luck. For Lillard, the odds of success were too long. That was a fair conclusion, too.  
  
I have not heard convincing evidence that a sensible deal exchanging the No. 3 pick (and another player, likely Anfernee Simons) ever materialized for Portland. Moving up in the lottery -- jumping from No. 5 to No. 3 -- changed everything. For most talent evaluators, Henderson is better than the typical No. 3 pick -- maybe much better.  
  
Trading a prospect that valuable for a veteran is a weighty decision. It has to be the right veteran -- available, reliable, good enough to put you into the inner circle of title contention, hopefully not so old you have completely knee-capped your future.  
  
The Brooklyn Nets never showed interest in swapping Mikal Bridges for that Simons/No. 3 package, sources said; it's unclear if the teams discussed it. The Miami Heat chuckled at Portland potentially asking about Bam Adebayo.  
  
The LA Clippers would push back on the notion that they genuinely explored Paul George's trade value, but if they had, you cannot flip Henderson for a 33-year-old who hasn't played in more than 56 games since 2018-19 -- let alone one eligible for a massive extension.  
  
The New Orleans Pelicans and Toronto Raptors weren't ready on draft day to pivot away from Zion Williamson, Pascal Siakam, or O.G. Anunoby, sources have said. Williamson is a franchise-changer when healthy, but he's rarely healthy. Siakam and Anunoby are very good -- Siakam is an All-Star -- but would either have vaulted Portland into the ring of championship favorites?  
  
In a strange way, you can trace the seeds of Lillard's departure all the way back to an opportunistic trade from eight years ago: the Blazers acquisition at the Feb. 2015 trade deadline of Arron Afflalo from the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Will Barton and a lottery-protected 2016 first-round pick. It was a sound move made with an eye on both the present and the future -- but almost nothing after that day unfolded quite as planned.  
  
The Blazers' moves, often lauded as smart, were ultimately not enough to catch the top teams in the West, or address the structural limitations of the Lillard-McCollum backcourt. Amanda Loman/Getty Images  
THE BLAZERS WERE 36-17, tied for third in the West, merging into the kind of improbable maybe-contender Portland's current brass probably dreamed of building around Lillard now. They were constructed around a tentpole star in LaMarcus Aldridge; a home-run draft pick (Lillard) swiped in a laughable heist of a trade with Brooklyn; and savvy under-the-radar acquisitions from the back of the first round (Nicolas Batum), restricted free agency (Wesley Matthews) and minor trades (Robin Lopez.)  
  
Aldridge was set to enter unrestricted free agency after the season. The Blazers had to go for it. They needed depth, and so then-GM Neil Olshey, dipped into the team's future to add Afflalo. The pick they gave up was lottery-protected in 2016, meaning that if Aldridge left and the Blazers bottomed out, they would keep it.  
  
It was the sort of small trade that would come to define the next eight years -- smart (not all were smart), but not enough to catch the big boys or in later years address the structural limitations of a team constructed around two small guards: Lillard and CJ McCollum.  
  
Two weeks later, Matthews tore his Achilles. The team faded and lost 4-1 in the first round.  
  
The Blazers appeared to know Aldridge had eyes for the San Antonio Spurs. Ahead of the draft, Olshey dealt Batum to the Charlotte Hornets for Noah Vonleh -- the No. 9 pick in the 2014 draft. (The Blazers also got Gerald Henderson.) Batum was about to enter the final year of his contract -- with a big new deal coming. The trade was largely praised.  
  
Ten days later, Aldridge left. Matthews bolted for the Dallas Mavericks. The Blazers appeared to be entering a quick-turn rebuild, with the potential of nabbing a high draft pick in 2016 that could propel the franchise forward with Lillard as the centerpiece.  
  
Plot twist: The 2015-16 Blazers were a playoff team. Lillard eased into an undisputed No. 1 option role. They got strong play from one forward they snagged in free agency (Al-Farouq Aminu) and another they stole from the Orlando Magic (Maurice Harkless) -- good moves. They flipped their 2015 first-round pick (Rondae Hollis-Jefferson) to Brooklyn for Mason Plumlee -- a serviceable center.  
  
Two years later, they traded Plumlee to the Denver Nuggets for Jusuf Nurkic and a first-round pick -- another reminder Portland did some smart things on the edges, but that smart moves on the edges often don't amount to enough if the bigger move never comes (or if bad fringe moves undo some good work).  
  
McCollum in 2015-16 won Most Improved Player. He was a great pick at No. 10 in 2013 -- the last time the Blazers had a chance to pick high until Shaedon Sharpe last year. (The Blazers also had the No. 11 pick in 2012 -- the year they drafted Lillard -- and selected Meyers Leonard.) Definitional to the Lillard-Blazers story is that by far Portland's best draft pick between Lillard and Anfernee Simons was another ball-dominant guard almost exactly Lillard's size.  
  
The 2015-16 Blazers won 44 games and a playoff series despite Aldridge's defection. Instead of picking at the top of the 2016 draft, they lost their pick outright via the Afflalo trade.  
  
That summer, they faced a fork in the road: maintain flexibility, or use their cap room while retaining several key players. Olshey concluded that opening meaningful room in future summers would require letting too many players walk for nothing and delaying McCollum's extension. He knew Portland had no history of luring major free agents.  
  
So, the Blazers spent. They retained Harkless, Leonard and Allen Crabbe on contracts totaling almost $160 million. (They matched a Nets offer sheet on Crabbe.) After striking out on higher-profile targets -- including Hassan Whiteside, sources said then -- Portland used room on a four-year, $70 million deal for Evan Turner.  
  
EVERY DEAL WENT bust. It was clear almost right away the Blazers would have been better off looking for bargains that might have turned into trade assets; using room as a dumping ground; or inking shorter deals to keep room open beyond 2017. It's not a great sign when your head coach (Terry Stotts then) predicts mere weeks after free agency, ""We are probably not going to make the quantum leap the salaries might indicate.""

Cronin and the rest of the Blazers FO have made poor trades, offered terrible contracts, and messed up the draft for the majority of Dame's career.  Cronin specifically, since he became GM, has publically spoke about building a competitor around Dame. Borrowing from u/OguguasVeryOwn, but [here is a good breakdown of what has transpired](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/14oapvs/how_joe_cronin_forced_dame_lillard_out_of_portland/)and how the Blazers have let Dame down:

1. **December 2021:** Dame's two areas of concern hadn't been addressed, as outlined [in this Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/2999270/2021/12/06/inside-the-trail-blazers-firing-of-gm-neil-olshey-and-what-comes-next-with-franchise-cornerstone-damian-lillard/?amp=1): ""Two key concerns of his were not accounted for last offseason: Lillard’s desire for roster changes and for Jason Kidd \[...\] to be strongly considered for the Portland job opening after Terry Stotts was fired. Olshey instead targeted LA Clippers assistant Chauncey Billups as the new coach and did not make major changes to the roster, believing the current core was built for contention \[...\] As far as the roster, Lillard had made clear to management in the offseason that he wanted changes and allowed Olshey to do his job \[...\] Fast forward to now, and the Trail Blazers have underperforming players across the roster.""
2. **February 2022:** Before the trade deadline, Cronin stated that the Blazers didn't have any appetite to rebuild - at this time the Blazers were a lottery team (albeit Dame was injured). [As per this NBA.com article](https://www.nba.com/news/qa-blazers-interim-gm-joe-cronin-focused-on-big-picture-approach), Cronin said: ""No, I don’t think we have the appetite to tear it all the way down. We have too many good players and too many ways to get better without taking too big of a step back.” As highlighted by u/OguguasVeryOwn, ""At the deadline, Cronin starts the tank by trading Norm Powell and Robert Covington to the Clippers for Eric Bledsoe, Keon Johnson, Justise Winslow, and a 2nd-round pick. He also trades CJ McCollum and Larry Nance Jr to the Pelicans for Josh Hart, NAW, filler, and a pick.""
3. **June 2022:** [Cronin then explains the thought-process](https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/trade-deadline-joe-cronin-blazers-press-conference/283-9cb7aeca-b02a-44c7-8441-ff07afc4d2fc)behind these moves. He says, ""When I first got this job, Jody Allen challenged us to put out a competitive roster \[...\] In order to do that, we had to shake it up and now we can move forward. So we feel like we’ve given ourselves that opportunity. We have a bunch of different tools. We can be a cap-room team, we can be a trade-exception team, we can be a mid-level team. We have numerous ways to acquire high-end talent."" Completely diminishing what he said days before - showing a lack of direction and plan. 
4. **July 2022:** Dame re-signs after a conversation with the whole Blazers FO and the Blazer's Grant trade &amp; GPII signing. [This is what Dame said after](https://www.nba.com/blazers/news/lillard-discusses-max-extension-staying-in-portland-his-relationship-with-jody-allen-and-ramping-up-for-next-season) the signing - essentially that Cronin, Billups, and Allen assured him they were committed to winning. He says, ""But just having those conversations. I would literally tell Chauncey ‘Are we trying to win? Just tell me.’ And he’d be like ‘That’s all I do is win, I’m a winner.’ And the same thing with Joe, and because, like I said, I had a prior relationship with Joe where I would sit in his office and we would sit there and talk about the board and stuff like that. The answers that I got, the responses that I got, I didn’t look at them like ‘Oh, he’s just telling me this.’ I was able to trust what I was hearing from Chauncey and Joe \[...\] Me and Jody spoke on the phone for two and a half hours, almost three hours \[...\] I felt like we were aligned, we were on the same page about things.”
5. **January 2023:** [Cronin still talks about being committed to winning](https://www.blazersedge.com/2022/10/22/23412241/joe-cronin-portland-trail-blazers-2022-23-interview-podcast-neil-olshey-damian-lillard-contract) after the Blazers are 19-22. This is while the Blazers are prioritizing development (not a direction the FO already spoke about going in): “You know, we’re trying to build, this isn’t a win-now roster as far as, we haven’t pushed in all of our chips yet \[...\] And this comes with a lot of discussion with Damian about trust in where we’re heading and trust in what Chauncey and I are telling him. We are building, we do want to win, much sooner than later and to do so we’re going to have to develop some of these guys that are going to have to help us hopefully sooner than later.""
6. **February 2023:** Cronin contradicts himself and makes moves that are contrary to the vision he has been talking about. He trades Hart and 2nd-rounders for Reddish, Thybulle, filler, &amp; a protected 1st-round. He also trades GPII for 5 2nd-round picks. [Here is his justification behind](https://www.blazersedge.com/platform/amp/2023/2/10/23595180/portland-trail-blazers-nba-trade-deadline-joe-cronin-damian-lillard-gary-payton-reddish-thybulle) it: ""It goes back to some of the stuff that we did at the last trade deadline: Accumulate as many assets as possible in order to make a big push for high-end talent \[...\] **We are borderline anxious to push all of our chips in** \[...\] We can’t wait for that moment to happen. It just hasn’t come up yet \[...\] **We are going to be ridiculously aggressive, to the point where once we push our chips all the way in, like, deal-to-deal you might say ‘Wow, they lost that deal. They gave a lot for that guy.**’"" - this is by far the biggest indictment on him and shows that he can't be trusted. 
7. **April 2023:** Cronin spouts the [same lies he's been spreading](https://theathletic.com/4396376/2023/04/10/damian-lillard-blazers/) throughout his regime at the end of the season while Dame spoke the truth and was straight up. He says, ""General manager Joe Cronin said it’s time to make impact trades \[...\] When asked if he sees a plan to make it all happen, Lillard said he sees “a road to what we could do.” “But,” Lillard said, “there is a difference in ‘We can do this … and we can do that’ and actually doing it \[...\] He said he wants proven veterans who can help now, not players who will need two to three years to develop \[...\] 'I’m just not interested in that. That’s not a secret, \[...\] I want a chance to go for it. And if the route is to (draft youth), then that’s not my route.” [Cronin continues to say](https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1645201945030963200?s=20): “The rotation's going to be much more veteran-laden than it was this year.""
8. **NBA Draft:** The Blazers trade 3 rookies - including a prospect that plays the same position as Dame. 

All in all Cronin, Allen, and the rest of the Blazers FO have been stringing Dame and the Blazers fans along - all culminating to one of their franchise GOATs requesting a trade out of there. The real losers of this saga are the Blazers fans.

It's easy to blame Dame for this but he rightfully feels betrayed. He trusted the Cronin and the Blazers FO and they kept stringing him along until the very end. This could've ended in a mutually beneficial way, but the Blazers FO upset that dynamic.

The answers that I got, the responses that I got, I didn’t look at them like ‘Oh, he’s just telling me this.’ I was able to trust what I was hearing from Chauncey and Joe [...] Me and Jody spoke on the phone for two and a half hours, almost three hours [...] I felt like we were aligned, we were on the same page about things.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.blazersedge.com/2022/10/22/23412241/joe-cronin-portland-trail-blazers-2022-23-interview-podcast-neil-olshey-damian-lillard-contract""&gt;Cronin still talks about being committed to winning&lt;/a&gt; after the Blazers are 19-22. This is while the Blazers are prioritizing development (not a direction the FO already spoke about going in): “You know, we’re trying to build, this isn’t a win-now roster as far as, we haven’t pushed in all of our chips yet [...] And this comes with a lot of discussion with Damian about trust in where we’re heading and trust in what Chauncey and I are telling him. We are building, we do want to win, much sooner than later and to do so we’re going to have to develop some of these guys that are going to have to help us hopefully sooner than later.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; Cronin contradicts himself and makes moves that are contrary to the vision he has been talking about. He trades Hart and 2nd-rounders for Reddish, Thybulle, filler, &amp;amp; a protected 1st-round. He also trades GPII for 5 2nd-round picks. &lt;a href=""https://www.blazersedge.com/platform/amp/2023/2/10/23595180/portland-trail-blazers-nba-trade-deadline-joe-cronin-damian-lillard-gary-payton-reddish-thybulle""&gt;Here is his justification behind&lt;/a&gt; it: &amp;quot;It goes back to some of the stuff that we did at the last trade deadline: Accumulate as many assets as possible in order to make a big push for high-end talent [...] &lt;strong&gt;We are borderline anxious to push all of our chips in&lt;/strong&gt; [...] We can’t wait for that moment to happen. It just hasn’t come up yet [...] &lt;strong&gt;We are going to be ridiculously aggressive, to the point where once we push our chips all the way in, like, deal-to-deal you might say ‘Wow, they lost that deal. They gave a lot for that guy.&lt;/strong&gt;’&amp;quot; - this is by far the biggest indictment on him and shows that he can&amp;#39;t be trusted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; Cronin spouts the &lt;a href=""https://theathletic.com/4396376/2023/04/10/damian-lillard-blazers/""&gt;same lies he&amp;#39;s been spreading&lt;/a&gt; throughout his regime at the end of the season while Dame spoke the truth and was straight up. He says, &amp;quot;General manager Joe Cronin said it’s time to make impact trades [...] When asked if he sees a plan to make it all happen, Lillard said he sees “a road to what we could do.” “But,” Lillard said, “there is a difference in ‘We can do this … and we can do that’ and actually doing it [...] He said he wants proven veterans who can help now, not players who will need two to three years to develop [...] &amp;#39;I’m just not interested in that. That’s not a secret, [...] I want a chance to go for it. And if the route is to (draft youth), then that’s not my route.” &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1645201945030963200?s=20""&gt;Cronin continues to say&lt;/a&gt;: “The rotation&amp;#39;s going to be much more veteran-laden than it was this year.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NBA Draft:&lt;/strong&gt; The Blazers trade 3 rookies - including a prospect that plays the same position as Dame. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all Cronin, Allen, and the rest of the Blazers FO have been stringing Dame and the Blazers fans along - all culminating to one of their franchise GOATs requesting a trade out of there. The real losers of this saga are the Blazers fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to blame Dame for this but he rightfully feels betrayed. He trusted the Cronin and the Blazers FO and they kept stringing him along until the very end. This could&amp;#39;ve ended in a mutually beneficial way, but the Blazers FO upset that dynamic. We aren&amp;#39;t talking about a random employee at a 9-5 job - this is about Damian Lillard, the reason why the Blazers have been relevant for the last decade, have played on National TV, had playoff success, and why fans filled up the Moda Center.&lt;/p&gt;

-

I'm in sections of fandoms that low-key encourage it. For example, a lot of people headcanon Alfred/America and Lovino/Romano from Hetalia to be mixed race (or just a different one altogether) while Arthur/England tends to remain white. That doesn't mean that people haven't made England black or that people haven't been attacked for doing so.

The same goes for comics, at least, in the sections I frequent. It's a very common debate on what skin color Damian Wayne/Robin (DC's Batman) should have and just how Arab he is. (That's not really a race-swap now that I think about it, is it?)

Both of these fandoms truly encourage ""take what you want and leave the rest"" behavior. However, like others have said here, if someone were to take Duke Thomas/Signal (DC's Batman) and make him white, there would be an uproar. I understand such sentiments and it would surprise me but idk if that would stop me from reading a fanfic.

In the fandoms where canon is a bit more adhered to, for example, The Lost Boys, I've actually never run across it. Even in my bigger fandoms, like when Rise of the Guardians was at its height. But I'm not here piddling in the likes of Harry Potter or Star Wars so maybe my fandoms just aren't big enough. Therefore, I can't give a proper example of how I'd actually react. For all I know, I'd actually get extremely unnerved or pissed off and this long response would mean nothing.

Overall, regardless of how much I've actually seen it in fanfic, I don't particularly mind because I'm in love with AUs and headcanons and just find it all generally fascinating. Canon and fanon are able to live side by side in my head without clashing horribly. Beyond that, I don't visualize well so I'm usually not really thinking of anyone unless the writer tells me what to think of. I see race-swapping more in fanart and then I'm just like ""ah, in this author's universe, they look like this,"" and it goes into its own manilla folder in my brain.

Honestly I think you covered all the points and I can't think of anything to counter. When I first watched the trailer two years ago, I thought it's some comedy anime but I never imagined the story has so much depth and realism sprinkled into it. 

Taking your foil theory a little further, Loid thinks of understanding others as key to world peace. I think he says this in one chapter cmiiw. While Donovan basically believes it's impossible to understand others. If the story is going to be something different than what you proposed, I don't I can bear the excitement lol. 

I didn't know about this commentary by Endo. But if I have to say, I guess I can see where he's coming from. Not taking Anya into account since she's an absolute sweetheart and won't hurt a fly except maybe Damian😉. People like Yor and Loid, they kill for reasons which can be justified as 'greater good' but they don't really have the authority/right to take other's lives. From the pov of their opponents and their families, these two are villians and horrible people. Also those people have their own messed up reasons for doing what they do.

**Damian Lillard’s last days in Portland? Where is James Harden headed? NBA Free Agency notes**

**Sam Amick | Jun 26, 2023**

&gt; Is this the offseason, at long last, in which Damian Lillard pushes his way out of Portland?

&gt; This next week or so looms extremely large on that front.

&gt; For all the focus on the Trail Blazers’ draft on Thursday, with the widely held belief that he wanted them to trade the No. 3 pick in exchange for a star-level veteran as a way of dissuading him from asking for a trade, it’s clear now that it was never quite that simple. A path remains — however narrow it might be — for him to be content with the Trail Blazers’ state of affairs heading into next season.  There is some time left, albeit not much, and some patience too. But the Blazers’ dire need to add elite talent remains.

&gt; Without it, these may be Lillard’s last days in the City of Roses.

&gt; As Trail Blazers general manager Joe Cronin shared with the local media on Saturday, Lillard is expected to meet with Blazers officials after he returns from his recent trip to Paris. According to a source briefed on the situation, the meeting to discuss the next steps of the roster-building process will likely be early this week. After all, free agency (officially) begins on Friday at 6 p.m. ET and there is much to ponder on that front.

&gt; Yet while there are all sorts of shared enthusiasm about the additions of Scoot Henderson (with the No. 3 pick), Kris Murray (at No. 23) and Rayan Rupert (at No. 43), the source said nothing has changed about Lillard’s strong desire to play with the kind of high-level players that would make the Blazers contenders again. The youth movement, impressive though it might be, isn’t enough.
 
&gt; So, what would it take to convince Lillard that Portland is still the place to be for the rest of his NBA days? Here’s one solution that is known to be a dream scenario from Lillard’s vantage point: Re-sign forward Jerami Grant and add four-time All-Star/four-time champion Draymond Green in free agency.

&gt; While Golden State is known to be extremely confident about Green re-signing, the price of his return is likely to be a point of contention. Enter the Blazers, who could make Green the unofficial savior in this sensitive Lillard situation while giving him a chance to add to his legacy in a different jersey after 11 seasons with the Warriors. Except for one (massive) problem: As is the case with so many of these scenarios, it would take some serious salary cap wizardry by Cronin to make this happen.

&gt; While the Blazers have Grant’s Bird rights and can thus re-sign him despite being over the salary cap, they currently have no room to sign someone of Green’s ilk. Especially considering he’s likely looking for a deal in the mid-$20 million range annually. There are sign-and-trade pathways to be explored, and likely with a third team needing to be involved, but it’s an implausible prospect to say the least. And again, all signs point to Green wanting to stay put.
 
&gt; There are other (unlikely) possibilities that would suffice, too, among them the addition of either Pascal Siakam or OG Anunoby from the Toronto Raptors. While league-wide interest remains high on both players, Raptors president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri has continued to rebuff the many suitors. The farther you go down this list of potential ways to calm the Lillard waters, the more likely it seems that he’ll be forced to face this stay-or-go fork in the road soon. In a holistic sense, the meeting between Lillard and the Blazers this week will have everything to do with what comes next between these two parties.

&gt; If Cronin and his staff are truly trying to scour the league for another star, following through on the messaging that sources say Lillard has received from both Cronin and owner Jody Allen, then Lillard likely won’t make a final decision on how to play this until the early stages of the free agency period have passed. But if they’re not, as a recent ESPN report seemed to suggest, then the prospect of Lillard asking out might be around the corner. Key questions like these will surely be at the heart of their meeting.

&gt; But if there isn’t a meeting of the Trail Blazers minds in Portland this week, and if the roster upgrades that are proving so difficult to pull off don’t come to fruition when the calendar turns to July and the crucial week that follows, it’s all eyes on Miami from there. Lillard indeed has serious interest in joining the Heat, who would surely love to pair him with Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. If it reaches this point — and there’s still an “if” here considering all the times Lillard chose not to ask out before — Lillard’s wishes would matter a great deal because of the enormity of his contract.
 
&gt; With four seasons and a combined $216 million left on his deal (including a player option worth $63 million in the 2026-27 season), the prospect of a team trading for Lillard against his wishes is hard to fathom. So while he doesn’t have the kind of no-trade clause that played such a pivotal part in the recent Bradley Beal trade from Washington to Phoenix, his leverage in the situation is similar.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1687802050.0,,False,0.0,{},jpm7biw,False,t3_14jhqin,False,t1_jpm7biw,False,t3_14jhqin,/r/nba/comments/14jhqin/sam_amick_lillard_indeed_has_serious_interest_in/jpm7biw/,,1.0,False,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the Lillard piece in case anyone doesn&amp;#39;t have a subscription.

&gt;It's a meta reason to put a character with all the characters they belong with and will most likely be written with in the future?

Yes, because it’s a Wonder Woman comic.

Lizzie doesn’t belong to Damian and Jon, they have 15-18 years on her, they aren’t the same generation any more than Yara Flor is. 

I don’t give a shit about who the future justice league is, if your gonna introduce a major character like Wonder Woman’s daughter than they should instead establish and start off with demonstrating how she fits into Wonder Woman’s mythos, how she engages with Wonder Woman’s sisters, what’s her relationship with Hippolyta and Themyscira, and what he relationship is like with Diana herself. 

The first thing established should not be her relationship with the SuperSons, why the fuck is a major event like Wonder Woman having a daughter being dictated by the SuperSons?

&gt;What I'm gathering from your comment is more or less Wonder Woman #800 should have been more or less only confined to the Wonder Woman mythos and cast.

No, just that it shouldn’t take precedence over her own damn supporting characters.

There was zero reason as to why Superman and fucking Batman got more page time over Donna, Cassie and Artemis. Not a single reason aside from the meta-reason that they are popular.

Superman and Batman should have got a page each, Donna, Cassie and Artemis should have gotten multiple pages each.

There also shouldn’t be any creepy fucking romantic undertones in Superman and Batman’s dreams, and just shows that apparently Wonder Woman can never and will always be teased as a love interest for either of them, even in her own damn celebratory comic. 

Is King that much of hack he can’t even write male/female friendships without inserting romantic undertones? 

&gt;But Wonder Woman is more than just her solo series.

So? None of these have been major impacts on her character, Wonder Woman gets treated like shit by team up stories, how many team up stories are there where Wonder Woman is the lead driving the story? The lead where she gets to be the big hero and save the day? Very fucking few.

How many key Wonder Woman justice league stories are do you see being praised as must reads for the character?

They could have given the non-wonder woman characters a page each to show what she does for others. I’m not saying they can’t be in the book, I’m saying they shouldn’t have been given more precedent of the actual fucking Wonder Woman characters. This ain’t a hard thing to understand and it sure as shit shouldn’t be controversial to expect Wonder Woman characters to get more focus over Batman and Superman, who are overexposed as it and has no business taking up so much time of Diana’s celebratory milestone issue. 

Don’t even get me started on how it’s arguably sexist for the 1 woman of the trinity to be seen and offer nothing of value aside from being emotional support for the 2 dudes, apparently that’s all Wonder Woman offers, she’s gotta be the ‘rock’ that allowed Batman and Superman to demonstrate their true feelings (gross).

Don’t even get met started how Wonder Woman being a trinity member has done nothing but treat her like shit, a baton to be passed around, and that she’s again the trinity member that gets the shaft all the time, never Batman or Superman. 

&gt;And just to circle back to this point: Because characters in an interconnected universe, characters don't exist in a vacuum. Wonder Woman was in the JSA and is a prominent member of the JLA (and has been with the JL Dark). 

Yet she rarely ever got moments to shine and was often treated like shit by writers, so can’t say I care too much about the JLA. 

Yet the comic didn’t give a shit to include any actual Justice League Dark characters did it? No, Zatanna here was there? Despite Justice League Dark arguably utilising and treating Diana with more respect than most Justice League Runs. 

&gt;Donna was a founding member of the Teen Titans (and officially debuted as her own character- Donna Troy- in the same issue the Teen Titans debuted)  and is in the current Titans book. 

Again, so what she’s still Wonder Woman’s sister. 

&gt;Cassie joined Young Justice a little under 3 years after her debut, 

Again I’m not seeing your point here. 

&gt;Either way, my point is:

Except Diana’s solo series is the meat and fucking bones of the character. As I said, ask any Wonder Woman, and they’ll tell you how shit and dirty she’s been treated by team up comics.

Lizzie is being introduced as Diana’s daughter, that should take precedence over her being friends with the SuperSons, which barely again makes sense

(Why would Wonder Woman ever entrust her daughter to be babysit by Damian Wayne, over Donna or Cassie? they’ve barely interacted in comics, it’s a meta reason). 

It’s never Batman or Superman taking a backseat to Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman the one that gets worfed, Wonder Woman’s the one that always plays support, Wonder Woman’s the one writers always ignore or treat like shit, and Wonder Woman’s the one that has to give up like 8 pages of her celebratory comic for Batman and Superman + the back up with Lizzie. 

So I as a Wonder Woman fan couldn’t give a shit about Wonder Woman’s connectedness to the wider universe because it’s done more harm to the character than it has good. 

Even if Lizzie’s supposed to be the next generation, again as I said why the fuck is the back up story, of a Wonder Woman book, about Wonder Woman’s daughter more focused on Lizzie’s dynamics with the Super Sons instead of first establishing her role in Wonder Woman’s mytho’s? 

If they wanted a Super Sons or next generation heroes story than start a fucking seperate book about them.

That’s what they did with Donna and Cassie. Cassie was introduced in Wonder Woman first, fleshed out her connection to Diana and her mythos and would eventually join Young Justice later. 

&gt;Lizzie very much seems like character more situated in Wonder Woman's broader in-universe legacy and not the narrow Wonder Woman Family/mythos legacy you wanted.

How can you know? All we’ve seen of Lizzie is her friendship with Jon and Damian as apparently that was the most important thing to be shown first because Kings a hack that had to self insert his own family dynamics instead of thinking about how Diana having a daughter is a relevant or good direction for the character. 

Fuck anything actually about Wonder Woman, there’s zero reason for Lizzie to be more situated in the wider universe than the Wonder Woman mytho’s. Zero aside from the meta reason. You gonna tell me characters like Donna, Cassie, Artemis and Hippolyta wouldn’t be all over Wonder Woman’s daughter, looking out for her and ensuring she’s safe?

&gt;PS: Kinda hard for Donna, Cassie, and Yara to be Lizzie's ""sisters"" when they're Wonder Woman's sisters. They'd be her aunts.

They can still have sisterly dynamics. 

Yara isn’t even blood related to Diana, and she’s around the same age as Jon is, if Jon is considered the same generation as Lizzie than so would fucking Yara.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1687392285.0,,False,0.0,{},jp13f8s,False,t3_14ekwqs,False,t1_jp13f8s,True,t1_jozfwp6,/r/DCcomics/comments/14ekwqs/comic_excerpt_dont_know_when_or_how_theyll_do_it/jp13f8s/,,2.0,False,True,False,DCcomics,t5_2qlmm,r/DCcomics,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,2.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

[],False,,Queenofbees2,,,,[],,,,text,t2_9frzxvqw,False,False,"I have a lot of thoughts on potential directions of members of the Batfam in particular. 

1.) Let Jason exorcise his demons a bit more. He should journey through some sort of mystical world with monsters and ghosts facilitated either by the Wonder Woman world and cast or by Zatanna, Constantine and the magical side of the universe. This journey should allow to confront his past and clarify his current moral state. He should reach important conclusions such as the value of the no-kill rule (so that civilians aren’t afraid of them, and they can be a source of light, not just something to scare away a deeper darkness), let go of any lingering resentment for the Batfam and just generally deal with all of his unresolved trauma. Jason should come out ready to be a Batman willing to ramp up his aggression earlier in a fight than Bruce would and more wise-cracking, but nothing incompatible with the heart of the role.

2.) Retire Bruce. Acknowledge that he’s too old to keep taking these kinds of beatings. If we agree that Dick is late 20s-early 30s, Bruce must be well over 50 now. Jason takes over the role until Damian is old enough, Damian stays as Robin. Initially Bruce works in an Oracle-type role for the Batfam like in Batman Beyond but then rekindles his relationship with Selina. He joins her in her mission to take down corrupt and criminal institutions in Gotham through espionage (less physically taxing than bruising with street-level goons). They get married and open an orphanage together. 

3.) Cancel the Nightwing series. I love Dick with my whole heart but the Nightwing book has been going absolutely nowhere for a very long time. Essentially divorce Dick from the street-level Batfam story-wise and go all in with the Titans as the new JL with him as leader. Global-scale threats, fate of the world stakes, send them to space, etc. Don’t just recycle the same old character drama. Considering his personal life, he really wants to propose to Babs but for a while, she isn’t ready. Titans Tower eventually moves from Bludhaven to somewhere more remote and he does his best to split his time between there and his home in Bludhaven. Eventually, Babs and him get married and are simply happy together, despite having very separate lives, story-wise. 

4.) Give Barbara her own series as the new guardian of Bludhaven now Nightwing is doing Titans stuff. Give her a new codename, maybe Osprey. Show her physical rehabilitation struggles and her frustration at not being able to make a full recovery the way Batman did after Knightfall. Barbara works from home at some sort of start-up for helping people. She goes out as Osprey when she has the time/has good days physically but otherwise still does Oracle work for the Batfam, BoP and wider superhero community when needed. Whilst volunteering at a club for kids with disabilities, she meets a young boy who’s an online bully and involved in criminal activity but has a good heart and wants to be a writer. She acts as his mentor. Babs also reaches out to Seer, a young genius hacker girl introduced as a villain during Fear state and the early part of Batgirls run who is an orphan from a ruined crime family. She and Dick reform and adopt her, and she acts as Oracle to Babs and Steph (more on that later). During the series, she’ll reckon with her insecurities about marrying Dick until she finally proposes to him. Near the end of the series, Babs either decides to start her own company or take in greater responsibility in her current job she has less time to spend for superheroing, so her book ends and Steph’s Batgkrl book starts

5.) Steph moves to Bludhaven to assist Babs in protecting it, particularly on days she can’t go out as Osprey. She decides to forego college and instead gets a job designing escape rooms or something like that. Steph continues as Batgirl, first as a supporting character in Babs’ book before getting her own. Her book should have a bit of a slice of life vibe, showing her bubbly, funny side by exploring Steph’s love life and friendships, whilst never shying away from her past, tackling her relationships with her parents and her teen pregnancy for example. The vibe should be a cross between She-hulk and Jessica jones. I hate the way Tim and Steph were broken up but I don’t see much point in putting them back together. They should definitely remain friends whilst Steph sees other people. 

6.) Cass decides to go to university somewhere new, maybe in the Hill where the current run is set, to study classical literature and/or psychology. It should feel completely out of her comfort zone. Cass remains Batgirl with the same costume when she operates in Gotham with the rest of the Batfam, but at uni she wears a different, more low-key costume with no codename when she goes out to fight crime. Cass gets a brand new supporting cast and has low-stakes plots, similar to Babs’ Batgirl of Burnside run

7.) The Question book starring Renee Montoya who once more has resigned from police work and gone into private investigation and Tim Drake who has abandoned the Robin identity to become Renee’s partner. His codename could be The Clue or something like that. They solve mysteries together, with Tim providing valuable backup to Renee who’s always gone solo and also tech support. Tim is also going to college part/time to get a degree in something computer-related. Eventually, Tim graduates college and gets a job offer from a tech firm in Metropolis. He moves to Metropolis but hates the job and quits, decides to open his own detective agency here- no codename. Eventually he and Jon Kent fall for each other.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1687359182.0,,1687482821.0,0.0,{},joyug21,False,t3_14er6x6,False,t1_joyug21,False,t3_14er6x6,/r/DCcomics/comments/14er6x6/if_you_could_make_3_major_changes_to_the_current/joyug21/,,1.0,False,True,False,DCcomics,t5_2qlmm,r/DCcomics,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of thoughts on potential directions of members of the Batfam in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Let Jason exorcise his demons a bit more. He should journey through some sort of mystical world with monsters and ghosts facilitated either by the Wonder Woman world and cast or by Zatanna, Constantine and the magical side of the universe. This journey should allow to confront his past and clarify his current moral state. He should reach important conclusions such as the value of the no-kill rule (so that civilians aren’t afraid of them, and they can be a source of light, not just something to scare away a deeper darkness), let go of any lingering resentment for the Batfam and just generally deal with all of his unresolved trauma. Jason should come out ready to be a Batman willing to ramp up his aggression earlier in a fight than Bruce would and more wise-cracking, but nothing incompatible with the heart of the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Retire Bruce. Acknowledge that he’s too old to keep taking these kinds of beatings. If we agree that Dick is late 20s-early 30s, Bruce must be well over 50 now. Jason takes over the role until Damian is old enough, Damian stays as Robin. Initially Bruce works in an Oracle-type role for the Batfam like in Batman Beyond but then rekindles his relationship with Selina. He joins her in her mission to take down corrupt and criminal institutions in Gotham through espionage (less physically taxing than bruising with street-level goons). They get married and open an orphanage together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) Cancel the Nightwing series. I love Dick with my whole heart but the Nightwing book has been going absolutely nowhere for a very long time. Essentially divorce Dick from the street-level Batfam story-wise and go all in with the Titans as the new JL with him as leader. Global-scale threats, fate of the world stakes, send them to space, etc. Don’t just recycle the same old character drama. Considering his personal life, he really wants to propose to Babs but for a while, she isn’t ready. Titans Tower eventually moves from Bludhaven to somewhere more remote and he does his best to split his time between there and his home in Bludhaven. Eventually, Babs and him get married and are simply happy together, despite having very separate lives, story-wise. &lt;/p&gt;

[],False,,Hungrypeach44,,,,[],,,,text,t2_14c24x,False,False,"&gt;I'm not saying that. I'm saying your opinion isn't necessarily gonna be the same as the majority of Wonder Woman fans.

Except Wonder Woman fans have been clamouring for Wonder Woman’s comics to actually build on her supporting characters instead of adding new ones for years now, and that includes Donna, Cassie and Yara.

It’s literally one of the biggest critiques of the character, Steve and Etta are the arguably the only 2 key supporting characters Wonder Woman has, in addition to Hippolyta.

Hell literally King got slammed with messages about what was happening with them when he announced Lizzie. 

Sure it’s hard to know what the majority want, but I feel like i can safely say the majority of Wonder Woman fans didn’t want even more Batman and Superman, in their damn Wonder Woman comics, especially not with the weird romance undertones which just weren’t necessary.

That’s never been something that I have seen any Wonder Woman fan ask for, really ever. She already has to play backseat to them in team ups, why should they get to steal page time in her own comics? 

&gt;Plus, I'd find it weird if they focus on Donna and Cassie anyways. I've read through the entirety of Wonder Woman's run since 2011 and they're barely in her books. If they really wanted to show off side-characters, they'd show Etta, Steve, Siegfried, Cheetah, or any of her friends from the Greek myth.

I mean Steve’s dream was in her last issue, and I think Etta might have been there as well (can’t remember) 

Siegfrieds like what? 1 or 2 years old? I wouldn’t be shocked if he faces the same fate as most Wonder Woman supporting characters and gets shafted out and forgotten, I certainly wouldn’t consider him more important than Cassie or Donna.

&gt;I'm ok with them not getting any focus though. I mean, as a Batman fan I'm not exactly clamoring for more screentime for James Gordon or Alfred.

But that’s just it, Wonder Woman fans have been clamouring for more Donna, Cassie and Yara as staples in her book, Donna at least had Titans to fall back on now though, so yay for that. 

There’s zero reason why Batman and Superman get more page time than Wonder Woman’s own sisters, they can still show up in the book, just without the weird ass romantic undertones, and give them less focus, they didn’t need 4 pages, it was underserved.

Additionally again I don’t see why Lizzie is being babysat by Damian and Jon, that makes zero sense at all aside from meta reasons and those characters own popularity.

Lizzie being babysit by Diana’s sisters that are her actual family in Donna and Cassie makes far more sense in just about every facet, but sense got thrown out the window because King wanted a wonder kids team up because he likes the SuperSons",True,False,,,,,0.0,1687351070.0,,False,0.0,{},joycv26,False,t3_14ekwqs,False,t1_joycv26,True,t1_joybdz6,/r/DCcomics/comments/14ekwqs/comic_excerpt_dont_know_when_or_how_theyll_do_it/joycv26/,,1.0,False,True,False,DCcomics,t5_2qlmm,r/DCcomics,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,1.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

Snohomish PUD high-reach bucket trucks are anticipated to arrive this week via FEMA-chartered air transportation, allowing the major repairs to the main transmission lines to accelerate.  Additional bucket trucks sourced by DoD and FEMA are expected to arrive over the next two (2) weeks, allowing line crews to address repair and restoration in more areas islandwide.

As power lines heat up, weak points of the system will be apparent (e.g., storm damaged transformers, fuse cutouts, lightning arrestors, connections). Crews will do their best to make immediate repairs; if they cannot, they will return to make the repairs as soon as possible. Please report emergency power issues to GPA Dispatch at 475-1472/3/4.

The island-wide power system (IWPS) may be unstable, with fluctuating voltages, power interruptions and intermittencies occurring during restoration and recovery especially after a strong typhoon. Outages or interruptions may occur after power has been restored. This is not unusual as the grid is fragile and a period of system instability will occur until full restoration is completed. GPA will make every effort to have power restored as quickly as possible to its customers. Once full restoration is completed around the island, the system will stabilize and less power interruptions will occur.   

Our priority is to restore energy back into your homes and businesses; and restore the island-wide power system online at full capacity.

Once full restoration is completed around the island, the system will stabilize and less power interruptions will occur.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our priority is to restore energy back into your homes and businesses; and restore the island-wide power system online at full capacity. GPA linemen and support crews are working night and day for you, your families, and your businesses. Si Yu’os Ma’åse’ for your patience and support.&lt;/p&gt;

Jun 5, 2023,

&gt; Reginald Fowler—a former minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings—was ordered Monday to serve more than six years in prison, forfeit $740 million and pay $53 million worth of restitution for a cryptocurrency scam defrauding the bankrupt Alliance of American Football league, federal prosecutors said Monday.    

&gt; KEY FACTS    

&gt; Prosecutors said Fowler, 64, lied to Alliance of American Football executives about supporting the league with accounts containing money from real estate dealings—leading to a stock purchase agreement that would cement him as the largest shareholder in the league’s parent company.    

&gt; In reality, the bank accounts were used to swap digital currencies for cash without the knowledge of the banks the accounts belonged to—resulting in Fowler processing roughly $750 million in crypto transactions in a span of 10 months.    

&gt; Fowler’s firm, Global Trading Solutions, worked as a payment processor for Crypto Capital—a failed “shadow bank”—and other crypto companies.

This story also did the thing I HATE where they reference important character beats...but it happened off panel (i.e. it never existed). What frustrates me too is that yet again Tim is written as gay when he's bi. I don't understand why writers can't seem to comprehend that BI = TWO. The constant framing of Steph as being ""not the right fit"" with the implication it's because she represents Tim being closeted is frankly insulting to bisexuals in heterosexual relationships. I'm disappointed that a queer writer (I assume the writer Nadia Shammas is queer given her inclusion in this anthology) didn't nail such a basic but KEY part of the bisexual experience. Also, Damian cameos for...some reason but adds nothing to the plot.

[],False,,Intafadah,,,,[],,,,text,t2_gwaajvay,False,False,"“The Portland Trail Blazers’ draft picks will play a significant role in the franchise’s offseason decisions. General manager Joe Cronin will either include some in a trade to upgrade the roster around Damian Lillard, or deal Lillard to bring back more of them as part of a full rebuild.

Portland’s pick situation, though, is a bit complicated moving forward.

Trail Blazers draft picks this season and beyond

The major complication stems from former GM Neil Olshey’s decision to trade an oddly protected first-round pick. He sent it to Chicago as part of a deal that brought Larry Nance Jr. to Portland which, in retrospect, wasn’t worth acquiring Nance, let alone sending out a first rounder for him.

Backtracking for a moment, though, the Blazers have two first-round picks in the 2023 NBA Draft. They have a high lottery pick that has the fifth-best odds to land at No. 1. If Cronin’s play is to acquire another star or a handful of role players to continue retooling the roster around Lillard, that selection carries significant value.

Portland also has the 23rd overall pick, which it acquired as part of the trade that sent Josh Hart to the New York Knicks at this past year’s deadline. This pick could come in handy if Cronin can use it to work out a deal with the Bulls to remove the protections on the pick they owe Chicago.

That first-round selection owed to the Bulls is lottery-protected through 2028. Portland keeps it this season, so those protections now roll over to 2024. Finding a way to work with Chicago to remove the protections would mean the Blazers are able to trade any of their first-round picks moving forward.

As long as Portland owes that pick to Chicago, though, it can’t trade away any first-round picks that could belong to the Bulls, which means every first through 2028. If they do work out a deal to remove those protections, they could theoretically offer first-round selections in 2024, 2026, 2028, and 2030. Because of the NBA’s Stepien Rule that means teams need to hold a first rounder at least every other season, the Blazers could then offer first round pick swaps in 2025, 2027, and 2029 as a way to circumvent said Stepien rule.

Removing the protections on the pick the Blazers owe Chicago is the skeleton key to unlocking the tradability of their future firsts.”

Here’s the most recent [article](https://nypost.com/2023/05/27/why-the-nets-trading-mikal-bridges-doesnt-make-sense/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter) from NY Post

And this is for anyone who can’t read the article bc of the paywall:

**Though sources told The Post that the Nets’ interest in dealing for Damian Lillard is very real, the Trail Blazers’ apparent determination to keep the point guard and move their No. 3 overall pick in next month’s draft for a veteran to appease him sparked different rumors of swapping Bridges for the selection.**

**But all indications are that’s not happening.**

The Grizzlies reportedly offered four first-round picks for Bridges, and the Jazz — one of the few teams with more first-round selections than the Nets over the next handful of years — has also been mentioned.

But the Nets, who don’t have control of their own picks due to the initial trade to acquire Harden from the Rockets, aren’t interested in a full-on rebuild.

Nets owner Joe Tsai and Marks see Bridges as a keeper, and he’s already the face of the franchise.

Bridges sat courtside with Nets and Liberty owner Clara Wu Tsai at last weekend’s Liberty home opener at Barclays Center, and called her “literally one of my favs.”

Bridges has rapidly become one of the Nets’ favs.

“I think he’s proven to a lot of people that his role can continue to get better and better and bigger and bigger,” Marks said.

“But now that when the ball is in his hands in those key crucial moments of games, can he step up? Can he be that guy that we can rely on in big moments? I think we saw it a little bit in Phoenix when Devin Booker was out. He carried a considerable load for them. And then we saw this year where he came in and immediately was a crowd favorite.”

Part of that was giving a crowd dispirited by the loss of Durant and Irving at least some modicum of hope for the future. Bridges outpaced all reasonable expectations, averaging 26.1 points for the Nets on .475/.376/.894 solid shooting splits along with strong defense.

Some have advocated selling high on Bridges, presuming he cannot possibly maintain that level of play. But Bridges also averaged 23.1 points on .484/.377/.918 shooting in his final 13 games with the Suns, taking up the scoring load for an injured Booker.

Leadership lessons

That stretch taught Bridges to be more aggressive on the court. He’ll mesh that with his understated leadership qualities heading into next season.

“The team we’ll have, obviously it might be a little bit different when the time comes — you never know, we’ve got free agents and stuff like that,” Bridges said.

“It’s funny because I was just a role player, so coming in and being like the star, you feel that star treatment. I kind of don’t like it because I was just down there with those guys a couple of months ago. I don’t like all this s–t. But it’s just [about] winning and being selfless, not trying to just make everything about me.”

That kind of team-first ethos is what the Nets are trying to return to.

Take for example Royce O’Neale’s rally-killing inbounds turnover with the Nets down three points and 6.7 seconds left in their Game 3 loss to Philadelphia.

Bridges stepped up to take responsibility, refusing to throw his teammates under the bus.

It was in stark contrast to league MVP Joel Embiid saying “me and James can’t win it alone” after the 76ers’ Game 7 loss to Boston.

“You want your teammates to be happy, don’t want your teammates to ever feel like you’re just going to stab them in the back,” Bridges said on “The Pivot Podcast.”

“It’s just about me wanting to be a leader where I want to lead in a positive way, so if I do get on one of my teammates, they know it’s coming from the right place.

“As a leader, I’ll take all the blame, I’ll do whatever, I’ll try to help us win all the time. But if somebody f–ks up and I’m hot, you know I’m not just hot just to … some people yell to yell. That’s not who I am. I’m yelling because I’m frustrated, but it’s for the best of the team. So coming into next year, it’s just being a leader, and from the jump, just show how we should win. All about this year is winning. Everybody wants to get paid. I’m like, s–t, when you win, everybody eats.”

That’s the same sort of high character that Bridges brought to Villanova and then to Phoenix, the kind that the Nets are rapidly learning about.

“You guys are without a doubt going to see the person that he is,” Bridges’ father, Jack, told The Post. “Of course you wouldn’t know this without him being a part of your organization. So you guys will see that, the organization will see that, the community, the fans, the team. I’m sure his teammates already see it. He’s just a great kid, a great guy all around.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1685204020.0,,1685212563.0,0.0,{},jlu5ace,True,t3_13tbekt,False,t1_jlu5ace,False,t3_13tbekt,/r/GoNets/comments/13tbekt/nets_interest_in_dealing_for_damian_lillard_is/jlu5ace/,,20.0,False,True,False,GoNets,t5_2sro2,r/GoNets,public,,0.0,[],,False,,[],False,,,damian keyes,,,,20.0,,,,[],False,,,,,0.0,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: I mistakenly posted the wrong NY Post article &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that was giving a crowd dispirited by the loss of Durant and Irving at least some modicum of hope for the future. Bridges outpaced all reasonable expectations, averaging 26.1 points for the Nets on .475/.376/.894 solid shooting splits along with strong defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have advocated selling high on Bridges, presuming he cannot possibly maintain that level of play. But Bridges also averaged 23.1 points on .484/.377/.918 shooting in his final 13 games with the Suns, taking up the scoring load for an injured Booker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership lessons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That stretch taught Bridges to be more aggressive on the court. He’ll mesh that with his understated leadership qualities heading into next season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The team we’ll have, obviously it might be a little bit different when the time comes — you never know, we’ve got free agents and stuff like that,” Bridges said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s funny because I was just a role player, so coming in and being like the star, you feel that star treatment. I kind of don’t like it because I was just down there with those guys a couple of months ago. I don’t like all this s–t. But it’s just [about] winning and being selfless, not trying to just make everything about me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of team-first ethos is what the Nets are trying to return to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example Royce O’Neale’s rally-killing inbounds turnover with the Nets down three points and 6.7 seconds left in their Game 3 loss to Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridges stepped up to take responsibility, refusing to throw his teammates under the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in stark contrast to league MVP Joel Embiid saying “me and James can’t win it alone” after the 76ers’ Game 7 loss to Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You want your teammates to be happy, don’t want your teammates to ever feel like you’re just going to stab them in the back,” Bridges said on “The Pivot Podcast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s just about me wanting to be a leader where I want to lead in a positive way, so if I do get on one of my teammates, they know it’s coming from the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a leader, I’ll take all the blame, I’ll do whatever, I’ll try to help us win all the time. But if somebody f–ks up and I’m hot, you know I’m not just hot just to … some people yell to yell. That’s not who I am. I’m yelling because I’m frustrated, but it’s for the best of the team. So coming into next year, it’s just being a leader, and from the jump, just show how we should win. All about this year is winning. Everybody wants to get paid. I’m like, s–t, when you win, everybody eats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the same sort of high character that Bridges brought to Villanova and then to Phoenix, the kind that the Nets are rapidly learning about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You guys are without a doubt going to see the person that he is,” Bridges’ father, Jack, told The Post. “Of course you wouldn’t know this without him being a part of your organization. So you guys will see that, the organization will see that, the community, the fans, the team. I’m sure his teammates already see it. He’s just a great kid, a great guy all around.”&lt;/p&gt;

TLDR: Everything points towards Bridges staying

Bridges has become the focus of the Nets’ marketing and face of their franchise, and has been seen publicly hanging around with team ownership. 

 Though sources told The Post that the Nets’ interest in dealing for Damian Lillard is very real, the Trail Blazers’ apparent determination to keep the point guard and move their No. 3 overall pick in next month’s draft for a veteran to appease him sparked different rumors of swapping Bridges for the selection. 

But all indications are that’s not happening. 

Nets owner Joe Tsai and Marks see Bridges as a keeper, and he’s already the face of the franchise. 

 “I think he’s proven to a lot of people that his role can continue to get better and better and bigger and bigger,” Marks said.  “But now that when the ball is in his hands in those key crucial moments of games, can he step up? Can he be that guy that we can rely on in big moments? I think we saw it a little bit in Phoenix when Devin Booker was out. He carried a considerable load for them.

- Dick steps up as the League’s leader in crisis time at some point and his entire series plot of becoming a Leader finally gets closure (but I want it to be earned. Not just shoved in our faces that he now leads the League)

- After the Sanctuary was destroyed by Mary and Supergirl, injuring (but not killing) many heroes and some villains in rehabilitation, Superboy asks for Billy’s help to put a stop to the Furies raid (they’re collecting objects for Darkseid, don’t know what they would be yet but they’re mostly antiquities). Zatanna, feeling guilty about how Mary turned out, comes along, and so does Kaldur after Wyynde was injured in the Sanctuary attack + Orion and Rocket after a ruction cell was stolen.

- To come back to Dick stepping up as the Leader, I believe it could be linked to the Sanctuary and how the world of heroes turned upside down that day. 

- On the side, Dick, Artemis (Crock) and Barbara are investigating the Red Hooded Ninja somehow someway and find out it’s Jason. With Jade’s help and an episode on Bowhunter Security, that is a given, at least to me

- M’gann learns that she’s pregnant and while Conner, Zatanna and co. are away or on their own paths and missions, Ursa comes on Earth with some Daxamites and tries to murder her (tries being the key word)

- Ursa allied herself with the Furies and Darkseid and while Mary and Supergirl are on their own mission, she just wants revenge for her husband but specifically on Miss M, Superman and Superboy. 

- The League is on maximum alert. The Sanctuary got burned down, Ursa tried to murder M’gann in her own home and with Savage and Darkseid being so much more “savage” with each other than they were before, they need to do something and quick before the irreparable gets done.

- Dick, Barbara, Artemis, Jason, Jade and Will + Roy and Jim have to deal with Deathstroke and the League of Shadows while also having to deal with Ra’s and Talia (Also: Jason kidnapping Damian sure didn’t help them get Talia and co. on their good side. She gets him back though, not before Bruce can know that he has a biological son)

- Supergirl, Barda, Bernadeth, Mad Harriet (is it her name?), Lashina, Mary, some Parademons and co. are sent to Themyscara to steal (again: an antiquity) but are met with Cassie, Kaldur, Conner, Kal-El, Billy, Zatanna, Miss M, Nightwing, Artemis and Troia. At first a showdown between Kara and Cassie, it quickly becomes cousin against cousin as Kara takes on Superman. Superboy gets knocked out. Barda and Troia are going at it. Mad Harriet changes fights depending on where she’s needed (in the end gets knocked out by Mary, turning against Apokolypse, just like Supergirl). Zatanna and Billy are trying to talk Mary out of it all. Ends up working, though not before some punches are thrown. Ursa joins along and tries to kill Superman but fails as Zatanna and M’gann knock her down. Barda ends up betraying the Furies too. Nightwing was also coordinating the Themyscara mission all along, he and Artemis being there too

- This whole thing was a diversion. Granny strikes against the Watchtower with some parademons and the son of Darkseid what’s his name but not Kalibak, and as it threatens to fall down on Earth, Cyborg and Halo boomtube the whole of it to another planet without population. Works out just fine, though it almost didn’t. They (along with Gar, the Outsiders and two or three Leaguers) defeat Granny and her troups inside

- The End. Kaldur gets reunited with a Wyynde who just woke up from his coma, Mary/Freddy and Billy/Courtney double date, M’gann and Conner are happy and rebuilding their Smallville home with Garfield there, Artemis and Jason opening their new home (She can’t live forever in Will and Jade’s household), Lian hugs Jade as tears fall down, with Jade and Will kissing, Dick and Barbara in their apartment being lovey dovey, Clark welcoming Kara in their household, Vandal Savage somehow being happy in how it all turned out to be and Zatanna in a bubble bath, smiling, with a glass of champagne in her hand

Let me know if I’m missing anything, whether it’s as simple as a twitter like. 

Gunn’s favorite characters, some of which we already know will be important to the DCU

- **Superman**
- **Batman** (with Damian being both Gunn and Safran’s fav Robin)
- **Harley Quinn**
- **Peacemaker**
- **Green Arrow**, already confirmed to exist in Peacemaker 
- **Bat-Mite** (Gunn’s fav Batman villain growing up), also confirmed to exist in Peacemaker. A while back, Flula Borg (who played Javelin in TSS) jokingly commented about his excitement for a Bat-Mite spin-off on one of Gunn’s IG posts, to which Gunn replied “you kid but…” If there is a Bat-Mite spin-off in the works it’s likely animation and who knows, maybe Flula will voice him? 
- **The Metal Men** DC has tried to make a movie about them for at least over a decade, the most recent attempt being an animated movie confirmed to be in development in December 2021. Gunn talked about his penchant for the Metal Men (as well as Bat-Mite) in the first meeting DC Studios had with WBD, so maybe this animated film is being repurposed as a DCU project. 
- **Batgirl**, Gunn said both Cass and Babs are his favorite Batgirls but has singled out Cass as one of his fav female superheroes that he would like to bring to the big screen back in a 2016 Q&amp;A. 

In that same Q&amp;A, Gunn said he was interested in directing films for Swamp Thing (now an actual film he’s producing), the Metal Men, **Jonah Hex**, and **Shazam** (a character Safran ended up producing 2 films for)

Gunn said 4/8 characters from this list will appear in live-action films: https://bleedingcool.com/movies/8-dc-heroes-we-hope-to-see-in-live-action-films/  
He then liked a tweet asking if it was Cass and the following 3, which also happen to be characters he’s hinted at before

- **Nightwing**
- **Vixen**
- **Static**, MBJ was producing a Static movie and he has interacted with Gunn on social media. Worth noting this doesn’t confirm Static as a DCU project yet and that it could be an Elseworlds project about the Dakotaverse instead (MBJ’s Static Shock film was reportedly meant to kickoff a universe centered on black superheroes)

So it seems the remaining four (Terra, Arsenal, Kyle Rayner and Jon Kent) are not planned for any film appearances. This doesn’t rule out TV, so could still see Kyle Rayner show up in Lanterns. Also worth noting that the list specifically had Jon Kent as Superman and not Superboy.

Gunn also said that 5/10 characters from this poll would appear in the DCU specifically: https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/18/img-1595-1676753792309.png
Other than Nightwing, the characters on this list that have either been hinted at by Gunn or rumored by scoopers are: 

- **Lobo**, basically confirmed at this point
- **Deathstroke**, hinted at around the time Waller began development so he’s likely in that show.
- **Red Hood**
- **Brainiac**, recently rumored for Legacy and would be the 5th character out of the 5/10 wishlist 

If the Brainiac rumor is false and/or Jason Todd remains dead in the DCU, the other likely candidates are: 

- **Martian Manhunter**, one of the classic 7 JL members and Gunn said he used JLU as an inspiration for the DCU
- Zatanna, has connections to Batman, Swamp Thing and the JL. She also had a theatrical film being developed for the DCEU but it was an Abrams JLD project that at one point was an HBO Max release. Because of that I’d say she’s much less likely than Hood, Brainiac and MM which is why I chose not to have her name in bold like the others. 

The remaining characters, however, we can rule out of the DCU pretty easily unless they only appear as cameos/small roles. Constantine 2 with Keanu Reeves is still in development and all the scripts for the Abrams Constantine series were already finished and being shopped to other streamers since last September. The Court of Owls and Mr. Freeze are characters that Reeves and Pattinson have hinted at using. 

Other characters Gunn has hinted at through interviews and twitter posts/likes are

- **The Terrifics**, including **Mr. Terrific** who Gunn has hinted at separately and is now rumored to be “Apex” on the casting grid for Legacy, and **Plastic Man**, which Gunn even pitched as a movie starring Matthew Lillard back in 2000
- **Joker**, name-dropped in Chapter 1 press conference and also happens to be one of the many characters on the cover of Terrifics #25 that Gunn randomly posted on twitter 
- **Poison Ivy**, liked a twitter post about her. Margot has also frequently talked about how she wants to explore Ivy’s relationship with Harley
- **Gorilla Grodd**, Gunn made a twitter post saying the DCU won’t have a “gorilla limit,” and also name-dropped him in the Chapter 1 slate press conference 
- **Deadman**, used him for a “happy halloween” post on twitter

Finally, I’ll also mention **Aquaman**, who is also on that Terrifics cover page that Gunn posted. Some people think that Aquaman won’t be important to the DCU because Momoa will be playing Lobo instead. However, Zaslav named Aquaman as an important DC franchise along with the Trinity. Gunn and Safran also named Aquaman along with the Trinity and Harley Quinn as key characters for the DCU. Momoa has also said he absolutely thinks Aquaman will be a part of the DCU.

My intuition says that posting teasers of songs that the target cannot click through and listen to or look up on Spotify or YouTube is a bad idea - personally I dislike that. A couple of sneak previews in the week before release I think are ok, but why bother doing a bunch of teasing for a song that isn't available to listen to?

Oh yeah that's really easy to answer. I'm not sure if people remember but I never planned to end it at that point after Iris. The story was going to continue but I thought about how much work was needed to actualize that continuation. I would have needed to incorporate Wayrest and possibly daggerfall into the worldspace and knowing how much work the reach took alone, was not a feasible goal. The plan was going to involve you choosing which faction or set of ideas should rebuild the Reach after the events in Act 2 (from Rags to Riches to Iris), and the many problems and hostile actions from outside the reach descending upon the land. I wanted to continue the timeline of TES by having another great war pop off, with your own war in High Rock against the other royal houses. Just a spiral to the ""End times"" so to speak. And that's where the good ending could come about, that you survive that end time and answer the fatalistic belief of ""It is what it is"" with ""It is what we make it"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized early on that Iris does resolve the mod thematically and narratively, albeit very bittersweet or grim. If I were to continue beyond that point, then you'd see how ""in development"" the story still was. So I decided to tie it off. Saying that, the mod would have neatly resolved itself at Rags to Riches, when you're knighted. That was the original ending back in 2016. But it wasn't the story I wanted to tell, it was very generic. And it would have glossed over major plot points like with King Sigmayne (which wasn't just ""shoehorned"" in as people think, that was in the very earliest draft of the story). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I really wanted to hammer home with the ending is that the system as is couldn't be reformed without major changes, some people wanted a peaceful ""good"" ending, but I ask them how can that be achieved? Do you simply talk all the nobles out of upholding the very structure that secures their privileges? You could say that bringing around slow, incremental change would be the key. But the prince and king are still there, those crimes are still being committed. Sometimes you have to hear the music and accept that only bad begets bad.

 who himself defeated JD Mcdonagh, Cody Rhodes and  Gunther,  in Saudi Arabia, it's matchday and the two put on a specticle, Balor attempts to pull of dirty tricks with even Judment day attempting to help him at one point but Seth overcomes those, Seth tries a pedigree but it gets reversed with Finn hitting the Coup De Grace and becoming the First WWE World Heavyweight champion (unless you count the old belt), Seth Rollins isn't done however and the two fued for the title until Summerslam where Balor ends Seth's hopes once and for all. 

After Summerslam Finn starts distancing himself from the Judgment day although he doesn't do an official betrayal. on an episode of Raw Drew Mcintyre beats Cody Rhodes to become the new number one contender for Finn's title, Drew has been something of a heel  but not quite as he's been blazing wrestler after another on RAW, he's earned this opportunity, Finn shocks the judgment day by deciding not to play dirty and fight fair by refusing their help during a non title 1v1 on RAW which he then ends up losing. 

Come ppv between Summerslam and Survivor series (i couldn't find any data on PPVs past Summerslam but ik Survivor series will hapen due to the draft so just pretend there's a ppv between that ex: Survivor series on December and this ppv in October, probably not really what gonna happen but yeah) Drew Mcintyre has been part of a heated fued with Finn and although Finn wanted to earn the win, Drew wanted a ""real fight"" so a no DQ-Falls count anywhere stipulation is attatched. In the match Drew punishes Finn lots, Judgment day try getting involved but Finn is once again insistant on doing things on his own. Despite all the punishment however finn hits a Coup De Grace on Drew who'se laying on a table and retains the title.

RAW after this PPV and Finn is celebrating his win in the ring, by himself, until the Judgment day arrive on the scene, Mami \*cough cough\* i mean Rhea congratulates Finn but Priest angrily gives Finn a deadline, saying he must either fully embrace the Judgment day or leave, Finn slowly walks out not saying a word, next Raw Finn is confronted by Priest and Ex-con Dom backstage and told ""tonight is the deadline"". It's the end of the show and Judgment day call out Finn saying he needs to ""get over here and decide, or else your decision has been made"", Finn comes out in completely new attire (not demon either), and says ""if i have to be a coward in the judgment day then i don't want to have to do with any of you""  Judgment day react by chasing Finn with Damian and Dom eventually catching up to him. Next RAW Finn has a 1v1 with Priest which he would have won had Dom not moved Priest out of Coup De Grace target, things turn to a boiling point so Finn challenges one of them to a match, Dom agrees but it has to be a triple threat between him, Priest and Finn, Finn accepts anyway  but the match cannot happen at the next ppv as he has to Face Roman due to RAW vs Smackdown on survivor series (a match which he ends up losing due to the temporary bloodline-judgment day alliance making a brief re-appearence).

It's the RAW before the royal rumble where Finn was supposed to have a match with Priest and Dom for the title but Priest gets injured during a brawl and Dom gets the 1v1 with Finn. Dom tries his best but Finn still wins the match and retains, the key event that night though is the rumble where shockingly enough Priest makes a shock appearence as number 27 at the rumble and ends up winning it, meaning he's guaranteed a shot at Finn in the Rumble. At the Raw after the rumble Damien and judgment day confront Finn and also claim Dom deserves another shot, Finn says in order to get it he's gonna have to get it, which is why he faces Dom 1v1 in a No DQ at Elimination chamber with Dom's place at mania on the line.

 who himself defeated JD Mcdonagh, Cody Rhodes and  Gunther,  in Saudi Arabia, it&amp;#39;s matchday and the two put on a specticle, Balor attempts to pull of dirty tricks with even Judment day attempting to help him at one point but Seth overcomes those, Seth tries a pedigree but it gets reversed with Finn hitting the Coup De Grace and becoming the First WWE World Heavyweight champion (unless you count the old belt), Seth Rollins isn&amp;#39;t done however and the two fued for the title until Summerslam where Balor ends Seth&amp;#39;s hopes once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Summerslam Finn starts distancing himself from the Judgment day although he doesn&amp;#39;t do an official betrayal. on an episode of Raw Drew Mcintyre beats Cody Rhodes to become the new number one contender for Finn&amp;#39;s title, Drew has been something of a heel  but not quite as he&amp;#39;s been blazing wrestler after another on RAW, he&amp;#39;s earned this opportunity, Finn shocks the judgment day by deciding not to play dirty and fight fair by refusing their help during a non title 1v1 on RAW which he then ends up losing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come ppv between Summerslam and Survivor series (i couldn&amp;#39;t find any data on PPVs past Summerslam but ik Survivor series will hapen due to the draft so just pretend there&amp;#39;s a ppv between that ex: Survivor series on December and this ppv in October, probably not really what gonna happen but yeah) Drew Mcintyre has been part of a heated fued with Finn and although Finn wanted to earn the win, Drew wanted a &amp;quot;real fight&amp;quot; so a no DQ-Falls count anywhere stipulation is attatched. In the match Drew punishes Finn lots, Judgment day try getting involved but Finn is once again insistant on doing things on his own. Despite all the punishment however finn hits a Coup De Grace on Drew who&amp;#39;se laying on a table and retains the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAW after this PPV and Finn is celebrating his win in the ring, by himself, until the Judgment day arrive on the scene, Mami *cough cough* i mean Rhea congratulates Finn but Priest angrily gives Finn a deadline, saying he must either fully embrace the Judgment day or leave, Finn slowly walks out not saying a word, next Raw Finn is confronted by Priest and Ex-con Dom backstage and told &amp;quot;tonight is the deadline&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s the end of the show and Judgment day call out Finn saying he needs to &amp;quot;get over here and decide, or else your decision has been made&amp;quot;, Finn comes out in completely new attire (not demon either), and says &amp;quot;if i have to be a coward in the judgment day then i don&amp;#39;t want to have to do with any of you&amp;quot;  Judgment day react by chasing Finn with Damian and Dom eventually catching up to him. Next RAW Finn has a 1v1 with Priest which he would have won had Dom not moved Priest out of Coup De Grace target, things turn to a boiling point so Finn challenges one of them to a match, Dom agrees but it has to be a triple threat between him, Priest and Finn, Finn accepts anyway  but the match cannot happen at the next ppv as he has to Face Roman due to RAW vs Smackdown on survivor series (a match which he ends up losing due to the temporary bloodline-judgment day alliance making a brief re-appearence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the RAW before the royal rumble where Finn was supposed to have a match with Priest and Dom for the title but Priest gets injured during a brawl and Dom gets the 1v1 with Finn. Dom tries his best but Finn still wins the match and retains, the key event that night though is the rumble where shockingly enough Priest makes a shock appearence as number 27 at the rumble and ends up winning it, meaning he&amp;#39;s guaranteed a shot at Finn in the Rumble. At the Raw after the rumble Damien and judgment day confront Finn and also claim Dom deserves another shot, Finn says in order to get it he&amp;#39;s gonna have to get it, which is why he faces Dom 1v1 in a No DQ at Elimination chamber with Dom&amp;#39;s place at mania on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brutal fight Dom ends up getting the win combining his own skills and help from the judgment day to get the win, meaning in a mania match overshadowed by Cody (who betrayed RAW for Smackdown) vs Roman 2 Finn defends his title in a triple threat vs Dom and Damian, Finn ends up defying all odds by retaining the title and having his Mania moment, wrapping up the year timeline by having a non title 1v1 vs Damien at backlash which he wins to cap off that fued and finally retaining the title and starting a fued with an up and coming Jhonny Gargano, who he would eventually lose the title too later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

* Jaime Reyes was created ""Pre-Crisis"" and he's about to get a live-action movie. Tim Drake was created ""Pre-Crisis"" so has Damian Wayne (as you noted). It's not because of that. There's another reason. Any ""Pre-Crisis"" character can thrive. They just need the outlet for it. Cassandra barely got that outlet (more on that). 
* Alright, let's talk about the elephant in the room WHY Cassandra doesn't appear in Batman's most celebrated and iconic stories. Let's start with Hush. There's a REASON for it. A rather racist reason. You look at the writer's work with Asian characters or actors outside of running Marvel TV and you see ""why"".  But okay, ""2011 onward stories"". Cass was denied this because well, someone on high within DC was quite vindictive against the character because they labeled the character as ""toxic"". Why were they toxic? Because of their own handling of the character, not because of the fans. Also, you look at the period of 2011-2020 was rather bleak to ANY Batgirl who wasn't Barbara Gordon. They EVEN listed Cass as a TEMPORARY Batgirl in the 2012 HC to Batman Inc Vol. 1. Cass was SUPPOSED to be involved in that story. Writer Grant Morrison even said as such, but SOMEONE denied them it. But there are stories Cassandra is celebrated in besides NML. Gates of Gotham (aka her final hurrah Pre-New 52). Bruce Wayne: Murderer?/Fugitive. Joker War.  The DCeased franchise. Note the closer we get to 2020 (funny that) Cassandra gets more stories to be played with by creators. Almost as if-- SOMEONE was denying them that chance? 
* You say that yet here we are in 2023 and since 2020 (funny that) the character's appearances have expanded past the comics. Had a significant role in the Artemis arc of Young Justice Season 4 (after randomly being introduced in Season 3).  The series THRIVES with legacy mantles and characters. Bat Wheels is the first cartoon to feature Cass as Batgirl (with even a hint that she isn't better than her predecessor). Again, they don't even throw the curve balls of her origin. She's Batgirl, and that's that.  Just a few months ago a variation of the character (Kai Li Cain) was in Batman: The Doom that Came to Gotham and is given a more expanded role in the film (which helps flesh out Bruce/Oliver Queen/Harvey Dent and better showcases the adoptive family Bruce built up in his journeys around the world.  There are hints (ironically) that Cassandra might be part of the same Bat Family that'll have Damian Wayne.  And of course Batman: Wayne Family Adventures where EVERYONE is getting the spotlight. 
* You say that she lacks an ""immediate"" connection when the realization is, she's the only one who values the Bat symbol and the value of life like Bruce does. There's a reason many fans of the character think she'd be a good heir to Batman because of that view. That's also the whole ""point"" of Batgirl Vol. 2's by having Cassandra be adopted by Bruce (a plot point that was last brought two years ago in the main comics and is a key theme for Wayne Family Adventures). Because like Dick, Jason, and Tim she does view Bruce as a father figure. 
* The problem with Damian Wayne though is that exact connection with Talia. It belittles her to being nothing more than a stereotypical villain though. Look at Talia in the 70s to 90s and then look at the character when introduced in that very story and Grant Morrison run of the character (Talia's role is the grand flaw of their run by making the character so evil). Their day/night portrayals.  Thankfully, current writers are bringing the more grayer side of the character back then making her a stereotypical villain.  Anyway, back to Cass. So Cass doesn't need to be tied to either parent.  That was the genius of Puckett by bringing Shiva as the opposite coin of Cassandra but also seeing the child was broken (she was brash and had a death wish) and healed her. By making her Cassandra's mother you run the problem YJ did by barely making the character resemble Shiva at all (instead she was like a Frankenstein's monster of New 52 David Cain and Mother since they used the Pre-New 52 David Cain portions for Artemis and Cheshire's YJ origins by giving them to Sportsmaster).

&lt;p&gt;A two year time skip. Supergirl, Mary, Barda and the furies play a big role. New Gods will be involved, including Mister Miracle who will be key in freeing Barda from Granny/DS control.

&gt; It’s going to take a lot of special games from Beal and Dame to withstand the deeper Dallas, who is getting healthy at the right time! -from /u/jay-diggles 

I only need one special game from Beal and Dame. This is a one-off play-in, not a series, which is honestly why I'm surprise I'm not getting the benefit of the doubt from more people. Damian Lillard can win a game on his own merit as well as anyone in the NBA. 

&gt; Their (Dallas) talent far exceeds that of a play in team. /u/kane3387 

I'd say that's true of both teams. 

&gt; Devin Booker just put up a series that is probably better than any of Dame's series(...)

Well...then even if that's all true, good thing this is a single game, not a series. And as far as single games go, Devin Booker is a beast. He just had his best playoff game of his career, with 47 pts, 10 asts, 8 board, 70% shooting, yeah it was against the Clippers without Kawhi or Paul George, and yeah it was next to 2 future 1st ballot HOFers and maybe the best true point guard of all time Chris Paul, but seriously that's a good game. That's a great game. A career game. Impressive Game Score of 42.9! That's really good!

But it ain't as good as Dame's best. 

55 pts, 10 Asts, 6 boards, ***96.8 TS%***, 12-19 from 3, +2 in 51 minutes, against Denver in 2021. **Game Score 55.9**

**Here is the point.** 

I'm saying that Wendell Carter Jr is good enough at what he does to make KAT not good enough at what he does to be the difference maker in this game. 

I'm saying that Grant does a GREAT job on Tobias Harris. I'm saying that hunting my team in pick and rolls won't work because I have elite pick and roll defenders at the 3, 4, and 5. 

I'm saying Caleb Martin and De'Anthony Melton are both extremely tough defenders that can play up or down at multiple positions as need be. 

I'm saying Bradley Beal is a really good player and y'all are letting a down year from WAS define a career. And statistically his years wasn't even bad. He was still and remains, very good. Better than Herb Jones' defense. 

But mostly what I'm saying, what I'm screaming to the rooftops, what I'm plastering on billboards and getting tattoed on my forehead is this; It's a single win or go home game, both teams have a lot of fire power. Both have different strengths and weaknesses. Only one team has Damian Lillard. In a series, I'd address this differently. In a series, it's a grind.

So don’t bother on their nodes though? My fastest event mine was 5H 45M - barrier time was a pain in my butt lol so I feel I could be a little faster but not sure. And I have boosted barrier nodes since the first attempt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I’ve typed out majority of my game so far lol, I may as well put out my SM as well.  (Another area of reckless spending and not fully understanding what was most important. Then when they nuked/changed how you get SM and mainlands roll in that, Ù_Ú that made me reloook at things and come to some not so fun realizations as to how I should have done my SM.. I’d lvl up as I got the gems etc. now I regret it because it’s not helping much, especially in frontier. &lt;/p&gt;

In 2013, the Port of Portland announced the carpet's replacement with a new pattern conceptualized by the Portland-based firm Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. The announcement generated a social media ""phenomenon"" and gained attention from local and national news outlets. Removal of the original carpet began in January 2015, with the airport recycling worn portions and making remaining pieces available for sale by local retail vendors.

In 2015, Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard released his first PDX carpet colorway on the Adidas D Lillard 1 sneaker.[1] In 2016, Lillard released the colorway on the D Lillard 2,[2] also inspired by the carpet.

In February 2022, it was announced that the iconic carpet would be returning to the airport when a new terminal opens in 2024.[3][4]

On November 14, 2022, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA introduced their City Edition uniforms. The uniform pays homage to the airport carpet with a sash design that mimics the geometric pattern of the carpet.[5]


**Background**


The original carpet, pictured at Concourse D in 2007, was designed by SRG Architects in 1987.
To reduce the amount of noise created by people walking across hard terminal floors, the Port of Portland contracted SRG Partnership to design new carpeting for PDX in 1987. The SRG principal and co-designer of the carpet, John Schleuning, visited several airports before deciding what to create for the carpet at Portland International Airport. SRG steered away from the earth tones traditionally used by airports in the 1980s, incorporating blue and green into their design early on and hoping to evoke ""northwest to the core.""[6] Its pattern featured geometric shapes on a teal background,[7] an abstract depiction of the intersecting north and south runways seen by air traffic controllers from the airport's tower at night.[6][8][9] Several acres of the carpet were installed by the early 1990s.[6]

Over time, the carpet gained a cult following. Multiple social media accounts were dedicated to it and more than 20,000 pictures were posted to its official Instagram hashtag, #pdxcarpet.[8] Airport visitors often took pictures of their feet on the carpet.[9]

The original carpet design received a positive reception by Portland residents and airport visitors, eventually reaching ""local icon"" status.[8] Its pattern was used on a variety of products, including bicycle helmets, socks and T-shirts.[8] In 2013, Portland Monthly published ""Ode on a Carpet"", a poem inspired by T. S. Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (1925).[8][10] In September 2014, PDX installed an 11 ft × 16 ft (3.4 m × 4.9 m) collage made of the carpet.[8]

A $13 million replacement[11] of the airport's carpet was announced in 2013, sparking social media attention that was picked up by local and national media outlets.[9] The Port of Portland received a large number of comments from local residents who were concerned about the original carpet's future. Annie Linstrom, a spokesperson for the port district, confirmed they were investigating recycling options and considering giving away portions to locals as keepsakes.[6][8] She also said that the Port of Portland ""understand[s] that people have an emotional connection to the carpet.""[6] In December 2013, Portland Monthly published a preview of the redesign, which was conceptualized by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects of Portland. The magazine reported that the new design included ""mood-enhancing colors and a new repeating pattern, while clearly preserving key elements"" from the original carpet.[7] Linstrom said, ""The Port hopes that travelers will grow to appreciate elements of the new carpet design over time, just as much as the old.""[7]

He doesn’t wake up for 30 minutes, and in that time the entirety of Arkham has become a charnel pit, but as badly wounded as he knows he is, Bruce isn’t dead yet, and as long as he isn’t dead, he has a duty to complete.

The Batmobile has been totally destroyed, so Batman is forced to take the keys of a normal car from the pocket of a butchered guard and drive to Wayne Manor with the traffic of a major city he’s majorly slowed down until he calls Commissioner Gordon and is able to get a police escort to his home but even then it’s still too slow.

After all the blood he’s lost, Batman has to be supported by Gordon but that doesn’t matter. He has to protect Gotham. He takes Gordon straight to the secret entrance of the bat cave. Dangerous, he knows but he can’t afford paranoia right now. *He has to protect Gotham.* It feels like it takes an age, but  the finally make it to the bottom. To the bat cave. To Conrad.

It’s already too late, he lured the Justice League here somehow and used Batman’s own contingency plans against them to brutal efficiency. Diana is dead having been brutally killed while she was totally absorbed in a fight against an unbeatable opponent, Jon is a burning corpse. Superman had time to fight back but he always over relied on his strength, never bothering to properly learn to fight. He suffered for that when a thin tentacle of yellow light, too small to be noticeable in the heat of a fight threw a kryptonite spear right through Superman’s back into his heart. The Flash had nano machines injected into him as soon as he was slow enough to target with a needle that was too small to feel from a drone nearly too small to see. They disoriented him and caused him to have a seizure when he started running, making his death a simple matter. 

Aquaman was dosed with fear toxin. While his death was meant to be a slow one, the immediate fear caused was enough to let Conrad dice him to pieces in the single moment that fear gave him. Only Green Lantern was left alive since his corp was the greatest weapon against fear, and even among them he was the greatest lantern of them all. But for all his ability, he was still only human, and he never stood a chance against a being who thought and acted hundreds of times faster than he ever could. His death comes just as Bruce finally makes it to the cave.

There is only Damian and Conrad left now, but Damian looks unsure and absolutely *terrified*. And from there Bruce knows that Damian had been sucked into Conrad’s seemingly inescapable orbit, manipulated and convinced to work with his foster brother, and only just now truly seeing the consequences.

“Conrad… why?” Batman gasps through gritted teeth. It’s weak, but he knows Conrad can hear him. “Because you would not.” Conrad took several leisurely steps closer to Batman, and already the metallic smell of fresh blood drenching Conrad is too much to bear. “And because Conrad is dead. There is only the Night Haunter, now.”

Gordon is shaking next to Bruce now, clearly terrified beyond belief of the Night Haunter, but he does not back down. “I did all this, father, because you would not. Because you let maniacs and sociopaths run the streets, murdering as they saw fit. I resolved a long time ago not to make the same mistakes as you. But I am not a monster, father. I am giving you a second chance to work with me. To finally give not just Gotham, but all of Earth the Justice it cries out for. So that the people living here can have the peace they deserve before the end of the universe.”

“Conrad…” The Night Haunter’s face visibly darkens. “I am the Night Haunter.” “Conrad,” Bruce says again, heedless. “You are a monster. I know what I saw in those bodies. You *enjoyed* what you did to them. You don’t care about Justice, you just wanted to sate your bloodlust.”

The Night Haunter bristled, shouting in a voice that made fear pierce to Batman’s very marrow, “YOU HAVE NOT SEEN WHAT I HAVE! NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER HOW MANY CHANCE THEY NEVER GOT BETT-“ he is cut off now in incredulous silence, a batterang caught in mid air between glowing yellow claws as another was dug into his neck at the same moment by Damian. Damian’s cut would have killed a normal man, but the Night Haunter was far *far* beyond that.

Faster than Bruce can see, Damian moves from where he perched on Conrad’s giant shoulder to being slammed into the walkway so hard it makes the ultra reinforced bridge shudder. He is dead before he knows what happens. Batman screams.

He doesn’t know for how long, but it doesn’t matter now. Conrad- The Night Haunter, is standing before him now, the wound on his neck already healing, his face a mask of pain and sorrow as he takes his giant hands, and crushes the heads of both Bruce and Gordon.

He hears clapping behind him

“Well done! WELL DONE! And they say *I’m* crazy, huh?” 

The Night Haunter whirls around to see a man dressed all in black, a cruel, red smiles stretched across his face. “Hey, why don’t you and me blow this popsicle stand?” He says, before bursting out into a fit of laughter as if it was the funniest thing in the world.

If Regina didn’t bother saving Cady from Jason and inviting her to sit down, who’s to say Janis would’ve insisted she get her revenge on? In the movie, right before the meeting, she tells her, “Beware of the Plastics,” and in the musical, Meet the Plastics is a warning to Cady from the jump (Cady: “Whoa, who’s at that table there?” / Damian: “Don’t look at them, just don’t!”). It’s only after the Halloween party when Cady sees firsthand what Regina’s like does she actively choose to partake, and that’s when they make the plans. Before that happened, all Janis wanted was for Cady to sit with them, take note of the stupid things Regina says, and they’d laugh about it. That was her plan. It’s only when Cady gets hurt that Janis decides Regina’s “not going to get away with this again.”

It’s no secret people love an underdog story, especially if revenge is involved.

In both the movie and musical, Regina frames the story of their friendship falling apart as solely Janis’ fault: in the movie it’s because she thinks Janis is a lesbian and interprets Janis’ attempts at keeping her friendship (“Why didn’t you call me back?” “Why are you so obsessed with me??”) as coming onto her; in the musical she pretends it’s because she can only invite six people and Janis went off the deep end at not being one of the few. Things got so bad Janis dropped out of school “because nobody would talk to her” in the movie (which suggests a freeze-out), and according to Damian in the musical her parents pulled her out—that’s how she got into art therapy and was later branded an art freak. There were also cut lyrics from the bridge of Revenge Party (and it originally went as the movie did iirc, with Regina and Cady discussing Janis) which went something like “Regina’s party / and everyone went / everyone except me / and then that Monday / some bitch scratched Dyke / on my locker with a key.”

So everyone knew about what happened between her and Regina. It makes a little more sense in the movie, where Regina was exploiting the fact the 2000s was more of a homophobic time. But because the musical gets a setting upgrade, and nowadays being queer isn’t as big a deal anymore, that reasoning obviously wouldn’t fly today, hence why they added a layer in the “I could only invite six people” line.

Plus, I mean, there’s a reason why they call them The Plastics. Plastic is synthetic, it’s artificial. What you see isn’t what you’re gonna get. People know Regina’s song and dance is an act and they believe in it because it’s just safer that way. She has the *means*, the capital, money, and (most importantly) the know-how to back it up. She’s a force to be reckoned with, and everyone knows it. If she can turn on someone she considered a best friend, someone she took time to cultivate a close relationship with (and we know teen relationships can get intense), she can do that to anyone, and no one wants to be next. They saw (or at the very least heard) what happened to Janis.

So when that friend everyone thought was socially dead delivers that huge speech about “So you know all the shit that’s going on with Regina George? *I* did that. That girl you all like now? Cady? She helped. She went rogue but the damage is done, we still fucking did that.” *of course* is going to get applauded by the other girls because damn, who else would’ve had the balls? Means, motive, and opportunity? And right under their noses too.

Obviously we know two wrongs don’t make a right, but the point is it’s *cathartic*. To people who’ve been bullied, it hits us in just the right spot emotionally cuz who hasn’t thought about getting revenge on a school bully? Whether it’s showing up at the high school reunion with a sweet new ride, a hot person on each arm, and being a millionaire by the age of 28, or all the shit they did with the foot cream and Kalteen bars. Especially if what they went though was traumatic enough they can’t let it go. We don’t know about movie Janis, but musical Janis went to some form of therapy and *still* engaged in toxic behavior.

Regina getting hit by the bus obviously wasn’t planned by the characters, but that actually managed to do her some good. And Cady got to redeem herself a little at Spring Fling. And Janis... in the movie she got a boyfriend to put away the lesbian thing ~~which was a horrible decision~~, and in the musical... I mean it just ends, doesn’t it?

If Regina didn’t bother saving Cady from Jason and inviting her to sit down, who’s to say Janis would’ve insisted she get her revenge on? In the movie, right before the meeting, she tells her, “Beware of the Plastics,” and in the musical, Meet the Plastics is a warning to Cady from the jump (Cady: “Whoa, who’s at that table there?” / Damian: “Don’t look at them, just don’t!”). It’s only after the Halloween party when Cady sees firsthand what Regina’s like does she actively choose to partake, and that’s when they make the plans. Before that happened, all Janis wanted was for Cady to sit with them, take note of the stupid things Regina says, and they’d laugh about it. That was her plan. It’s only when Cady gets hurt that Janis decides Regina’s “not going to get away with this again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret people love an underdog story, especially if revenge is involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the movie and musical, Regina frames the story of their friendship falling apart as solely Janis’ fault: in the movie it’s because she thinks Janis is a lesbian and interprets Janis’ attempts at keeping her friendship (“Why didn’t you call me back?” “Why are you so obsessed with me??”) as coming onto her; in the musical she pretends it’s because she can only invite six people and Janis went off the deep end at not being one of the few. Things got so bad Janis dropped out of school “because nobody would talk to her” in the movie (which suggests a freeze-out), and according to Damian in the musical her parents pulled her out—that’s how she got into art therapy and was later branded an art freak. There were also cut lyrics from the bridge of Revenge Party (and it originally went as the movie did iirc, with Regina and Cady discussing Janis) which went something like “Regina’s party / and everyone went / everyone except me / and then that Monday / some bitch scratched Dyke / on my locker with a key.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everyone knew about what happened between her and Regina. It makes a little more sense in the movie, where Regina was exploiting the fact the 2000s was more of a homophobic time. But because the musical gets a setting upgrade, and nowadays being queer isn’t as big a deal anymore, that reasoning obviously wouldn’t fly today, hence why they added a layer in the “I could only invite six people” line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I mean, there’s a reason why they call them The Plastics. Plastic is synthetic, it’s artificial. What you see isn’t what you’re gonna get. People know Regina’s song and dance is an act and they believe in it because it’s just safer that way. She has the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt;, the capital, money, and (most importantly) the know-how to back it up. She’s a force to be reckoned with, and everyone knows it. If she can turn on someone she considered a best friend, someone she took time to cultivate a close relationship with (and we know teen relationships can get intense), she can do that to anyone, and no one wants to be next. They saw (or at the very least heard) what happened to Janis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when that friend everyone thought was socially dead delivers that huge speech about “So you know all the shit that’s going on with Regina George? &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; did that. That girl you all like now? Cady? She helped. She went rogue but the damage is done, we still fucking did that.” &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; is going to get applauded by the other girls because damn, who else would’ve had the balls? Means, motive, and opportunity? And right under their noses too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously we know two wrongs don’t make a right, but the point is it’s &lt;em&gt;cathartic&lt;/em&gt;. To people who’ve been bullied, it hits us in just the right spot emotionally cuz who hasn’t thought about getting revenge on a school bully? Whether it’s showing up at the high school reunion with a sweet new ride, a hot person on each arm, and being a millionaire by the age of 28, or all the shit they did with the foot cream and Kalteen bars. Especially if what they went though was traumatic enough they can’t let it go. We don’t know about movie Janis, but musical Janis went to some form of therapy and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; engaged in toxic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regina getting hit by the bus obviously wasn’t planned by the characters, but that actually managed to do her some good. And Cady got to redeem herself a little at Spring Fling. And Janis... in the movie she got a boyfriend to put away the lesbian thing &lt;del&gt;which was a horrible decision&lt;/del&gt;, and in the musical... I mean it just ends, doesn’t it? We don’t know what happens after Spring Fling, do we? Other than her and Damian putting on the play to tell incoming freshmen.&lt;/p&gt;

No, I'm being for real and honest about what's presented in the comics. She's not better than Dick, Tim, Jason, Batman... I'm confident she's better than the rest though aka 5th place. She's not a better fighter than Bruce, Tim, Jason, Grayson... Arguably and very Damian because folks look at his ""League of assassin"" training since birth but LoA pales in comparison to Batman training, I'm pretty sure he might've lost to her once even but still aka 5th place, arguably 6th, I'm ignoring the unchecked props Grayson gave to her in THE Batgirls run... Like every time they fought recently he could dance on her while they fight. 

Athletic ability in general, 5th to 6th place, probably as good as Harley I'm not gonna lie and she's definitely not beating much of the Batfolks. 

Hacking and tech, tbh, I wanna say she's first though and so... She becomes the most useful and scary member because her skills are barely rivaled there? That should be enough respect! She can do so much damage with tech alone since the DC universe is extremely tech advanced. Why would they need her to be so generic when she can be so unique? 


&gt;All of what you said can be resumed “she’s better as Oracle because she’s a very useful supporting character” and that only shows that you don’t get her as Oracle either.

""Resumed"" ? Erm, you mean summed up? Assumed? And actually, ye, what's wrong with being a supporting character? She can be the main character in her own book still, you saying just because she's paralyzed that she's a terrible side character? Also, there's nothing wrong g with amazing supporting characters, most series have one main character that's not always the most popular or loved anyways. You're very immature and simpy. Are you 5?

&gt;Barbara is amazing on her OWN,sure she’s a key character as Oracle but she’s more than that,she doesn’t need to be useful to anyone nor be the supporting character of anyone to be a good character.

But I mean, every character has been a side character, even Batman and has been amazing in the past. There's a reason a ton of characters don't have their own books, also in the ""Batgirls"" book which I think of her as the main character of... She'd be much better off as just Oracle.

They’ve owned a few Toyota’s in the past but I just recently bought a ‘23 Tacoma TRD Pro and being in one again had them considering another. Originally they were looking at RAV4’s against the new CRV but coming from their Pilot, I felt like they might miss the slightly extra cargo space (although the Pilot owns the Highlander in terms of third row passenger and cargo space)

I live in Seattle while my folks are down in the PDX area and while I was bored in a work meeting I started looking up in stock Highlander Hybrids near them. Damian Lillard in McMinville had a few on their site so I called and asked to confirm. The two red ones that were discounted $3k weren’t there anymore (annoying sales tactic) but they had two more at $1k off MSRP. I handled all the negotiating and their trade info over the phone and e-mail and then my mom drove down, text drove it while they test drove their trade, and then she was signing and on her way!

I'll once again ask this question, but why would you take the headliner of the **only** billion dollar DCEU film - that being Jason Momoa as Aquaman - scrap his series, and then repurpose him as a C-list ""antihero"" like Lobo? Someone explain to me how this makes any business sense. Especially if the idea is to ""build on what worked"". Does James Gunn literally think his shit was the only shit that worked? We'll have to see about that, but sounds like with this many people writing it down like it's going that way, it's going that way. Throw a stick and hit an actor who could play Lobo, but what better casting ideas do you have for Aquaman than Jason Momoa? Some random white actor, just because of ""comics accuracy""? Whoever it is will never have the genuine badass quality - because it's a rare trait, and it's the reason Momoa is in Hollywood - that Momoa brought to the role of Aquaman in the public consciousness for the first time ever. They needed that bar-brawler, rough, rugged type of guy in the role to be taken seriously, and they actually cast it perfectly. And guess how Jason will play Lobo? Exactly how he plays Aquaman. Because that's how he plays everything. He's got one character, and he plays that character in everything. And if you didn't want Jason Momoa to be recognizable as Lobo, you wouldn't cast him as Lobo, so, yeah, it's just gonna be Aquaman pretending that he's Lobo now. Absolutely moronic casting/recasting idea.
2. For that matter, you're launching a potential star with Sasha Calle's Supergirl, you're literally planning on making a Supergirl movie, and so naturally you cut your breakout star off at the knees and recast, right? No, dickhead, that's not right. Have you never worked in Hollywood before, James Gunn? That makes about as much sense as if some other idiot replaced Michelle Pfeiffer with Halle Berry as Catwoman coming out of *Batman Returns*...who tf would ever do that? If Calle has as much momentum coming out of *The Flash* as it very legitimately seems like she might, I'm sorry, but you gotta be a total moron to **not** hand her the keys to Supergirl at that point.
3. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman...is popular, especially with women. **Source:** I live with one who doesn't give a shit about comics, nor do any of her friends, but they know who Gal Gadot is and they will buy a ticket to see her Wonder Woman films. Global pandemic permitting...
4. Ben Affleck is not the right choice for the DCU Batman; totally agreed. He's too synonymous with Zack's DCEU, he was basically the main character after MoS, and they need to move on from him. Same with Henry Cavill. Fair enough. **Gal, Ezra, and Jason do not have that problem**, because (by June of this year), all will have had their own unique stamps placed on their characters by other filmmakers with their own vision which surpassed Zack's. Ignoring Ezra's problems, each of them has stepped out of the shadow of Zack's DCEU. So, yeah, it's possible to only recast some of the JL actors. That being said...
5. The best choice for the DCU Bruce Wayne - not necessarily the long-term Batman - is Michael Keaton. This is the optimal casting decision when it comes to playing off of *The Batman*; for one to give space to the other. I don't care about a brand new Batman actor. Does anyone? Why would we? We just got one. I'd much rather revisit the familiar - who is, similar to Sasha Calle, looking at being very popular coming out of *The Flash* (and already apparently ""America's Favorite Batman"") - and see what he's been up to than starting over for what is perceptibly the millionth time this century. And these two respective takes are complimentary in how uniquely different from each other they are while also being 'definitive' in their own right. ""James Gunn has no obligation to do what Walter Ha-"" stfu. He does have an obligation. That obligation is to take what's there and make the best out of it. Not just to dick-around in his own little sandbox, but to reignite audience interest in DC Films. That's his obligation. This whole ""scrap everything, start over"" approach right off the back of the films getting good again is abject idiocy, and it's irresponsible management. So I hope he's not totally oblivious to what his job is.
6. If Damian Wayne is an actual minor as Robin, I'm not watching the movie that results. No thank you. It is the stupidest shit the comics ever did, I don't care who wrote it or what else that guy wrote, it's bullshit. And I already have to ignore it over there, which I've done by not picking up any new DC comic in the last 5 or so years. I have no interest in the cinematic version of that. ""But Hit-Girl..."", yeah well Kick-Ass is a satire of the superhero genre, and I've never seen the conversation around 'Batman + underaged minor as sidekick' narrative end particularly well once it reaches the mainstream conversation. I don't want that; it's stupid and it's distasteful. It makes no character sense for Batman (arguably, even allowing a sidekick doesn't, either), and it makes no physical sense because I don't care how well-trained a 10 year old is, he's not gonna beat up a grown man. I don't care if he's been training in the mountains with his master-assassin grandpa, it doesn't matter, it's ridiculous - Yes, it's even more ridiculous than Batman beating up grown men because, ya know, he's a grown ass man, himself.

I&amp;#39;d much rather revisit the familiar - who is, similar to Sasha Calle, looking at being very popular coming out of &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; (and already apparently &amp;quot;America&amp;#39;s Favorite Batman&amp;quot;) - and see what he&amp;#39;s been up to than starting over for what is perceptibly the millionth time this century. And these two respective takes are complimentary in how uniquely different from each other they are while also being &amp;#39;definitive&amp;#39; in their own right. &amp;quot;James Gunn has no obligation to do what Walter Ha-&amp;quot; stfu. He does have an obligation. That obligation is to take what&amp;#39;s there and make the best out of it. Not just to dick-around in his own little sandbox, but to reignite audience interest in DC Films. That&amp;#39;s his obligation. This whole &amp;quot;scrap everything, start over&amp;quot; approach right off the back of the films getting good again is abject idiocy, and it&amp;#39;s irresponsible management. So I hope he&amp;#39;s not totally oblivious to what his job is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Damian Wayne is an actual minor as Robin, I&amp;#39;m not watching the movie that results. No thank you. It is the stupidest shit the comics ever did, I don&amp;#39;t care who wrote it or what else that guy wrote, it&amp;#39;s bullshit. And I already have to ignore it over there, which I&amp;#39;ve done by not picking up any new DC comic in the last 5 or so years. I have no interest in the cinematic version of that. &amp;quot;But Hit-Girl...&amp;quot;, yeah well Kick-Ass is a satire of the superhero genre, and I&amp;#39;ve never seen the conversation around &amp;#39;Batman + underaged minor as sidekick&amp;#39; narrative end particularly well once it reaches the mainstream conversation. I don&amp;#39;t want that; it&amp;#39;s stupid and it&amp;#39;s distasteful. It makes no character sense for Batman (arguably, even allowing a sidekick doesn&amp;#39;t, either), and it makes no physical sense because I don&amp;#39;t care how well-trained a 10 year old is, he&amp;#39;s not gonna beat up a grown man. I don&amp;#39;t care if he&amp;#39;s been training in the mountains with his master-assassin grandpa, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, it&amp;#39;s ridiculous - Yes, it&amp;#39;s even more ridiculous than Batman beating up grown men because, ya know, he&amp;#39;s a grown ass man, himself. So kindly fuck right off with that.&lt;/li&gt;

[Damian Lillard did a great breakdown of it when he talked with JJ Redick](https://youtu.be/Y5sD0JvtRos). He was referring to Hardin's Rockets but his point stands. Which isn't to say that it's a ""*losing strategy*"" to have him on the team or something. It's obviously not. But there are disadvantages to running the offense through a player like him in the modern NBA game and there were multiple moments tonight when you could see it.

There were two sequences back to back, I think, where they doubled Trip down low by whole-heartedly abandoning Luke Kennard at the top of the key. It's basically a layup for Nuke, yet the Rockets were confident they could just leave him be and that Trip wouldn't kick it out to him. And they were right. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/CKxTD84.jpg) and [then again here](https://i.imgur.com/pxkGez7.jpg). They were willing to leave the most dangerous 3PT shooter we have wide open because they knew that **a.)** Trip was never going to pass it to him, **b.)** worst case scenario he scores a two and they can go to the other end and possibly make a 3 or **c.)** best case they foul him and he misses 1 or both free throws and we come up empty.

We can't afford to pass up opportunities like those come playoffs. If we were playing the Warriors, that would play right into their hands. Triple-Single would foul Jaren in a heartbeat and make sure there was no chance at a 3-point play. Then they'd go to the other end and hit a three.

Case Name: turnabout walmart (sorry plz suggest a better name)

Type of Case: standard. A few years before Phoenix became an attorney.

Defense Attorney: Mia Fey

Prosecutor: Lana Skye

Detective: Tyrell Badd

Assistant: Phoenix Wright 

Defendant: Byrne Faraday

Victim: Sam Walton (co-founder of Walmart)

Witness: Bud Walton (co-founder of Walmart), Tyrell Badd, Damian Stroke, Felicia Stroke (Damian’s daughter), Alyssa Welton (a blue collar worker in Walmart), restaurant waiter

Killer: Damian Hada Stroke (one of personal servant of Sam Walton, but also an overworked blue collar worker)

Method of Killing: the victim was strangled prior to being killed, as shown on the marks of his neck. There’s no fingerprint on the neck. Presumably, the murderer wiped it off. The actual murder suffers a blunt force to the head, which immediately kills the victim. However, it’s unexplained where the murder weapon is.

Description:

Byrne Faraday slipped into Bud Walton’s office in the late evening around 11:00, trying to uncover news about Sam and Bud Walton’s illegal businesses. However, he was seen leaving the office by Alyssa Welton. At the time, she didn’t think much about it, being overworked and exhausted. He also didn’t notice her; he thought Walmart was closed already.

The next day was a hot and humid day. In the late morning, Bud Walton, business deals guests, arrived at the the Walton brothers’ office. They discovered the body upon opening the door. The key is only held by 3 people: Sam Walton, Bud Walton, and Damian.

Police shortly arrived after and inspected the body, where they determined the body died at between 9-10 midnight.

Byrne Faraday was arrested immediately.

In court, Detective Badd narrated the event and discoveries. 

Alyssa then was brought up as a witness.

Alyssa recalled the event, where she oddly saw Byrne Faraday exiting the Walton’s office at around that time.

There’s also a security camera at the entrance of Walmart. It captured Byrn Faraday exiting, thus verifying Alyssa’s statement.

Byrne Faraday didn’t deny that he illegally trespassed Walmart.

As Mia, you need to prove Byrne Faraday’s innocence. You commented that if the door is locked, then the only one who could have killed Sam are Bud Walton and Damian.

Bud Walton and Damian are called to witnesses as results.

Walton came as the first witness. You were able to press him, but were ultimately unable to counter his statements.

Damian also had a perfect Alibi of being seen eating with his daughter, Felicia Stroke, in the restaurant, at around 9:00 in the evening. It was his pay day after all.

However, it is unexplained how Byrne Faraday could get into the office, or how he could lock the door back. You also brought up how he is empty handed when he was captured in the camera while exiting Walmart. There’s no way to conceal a large enough blunt object that could struck a decisive blow on the witness. The murder weapon was also not found at the scene of crime or any part in Walmart. Any large enough blunt valuable sold in Walmart has been tested with luminol, to no avail.

Thus, you demanded for a prolonging of trial for a second day.

I’m too lazy to write the second day. Just fill in the gaps

Truth: Sam Welton and Damian had a discussion about Damian’s pay in the frozen stock area in the AFTERNOON. The discussion quickly turned violent. In an outrage, Damian strangled Sam. Damian proceeds to grab a nearby ice pack and swung it toward Sam’s direction. It was a simple outrage, but the force killed Sam immediately. Damian realized what he had done. He hid the body and ice pack among frozen stocks.

Next day in the early morning, he arrived first, just as he has always done. Him entering Walmart was also captured by the security camera, tho it’s nothing eye catching, since he has always arrived first. 

He started transporting goods in and out of the area. 

He transported the victim’s body and ice pack (murder weapon) by disguising as transporting blankets and other goods, like it was his everyday job. As one of the Welton’s secretary, he holds the key to the room. He then dumped the corpse and ice cubes (from the ice pack) in the room and turned the heater in the room on, in order to defrost the victim’s body; he also hoped the ice cube would melt and evaporate. He then locked the room back up to ensure that nobody would discover the body soon before the body defrosts. 

For context, freezing a body slows the decaying process of a corpse. Thus, changing the body’s crime scene from a freezer to a hot room might cause the time of death to be incorrectly determined later than the actual time of death. 

It is just unfortunate that Byrne was seen at around the same time that the victim was determined to “die at”.

Normally, a room shouldn’t be humid. But the victim’s body, which was frozen, along with ice cubes, carried water fragments. which cause the room to be hot, humid, and wet, after the heater warms everything up.

He then hid the plastic bag, which contained the ice cubes that was now dumped into the office and evaporated, among the unused plastic packs. The action completely hides the murder weapon used to cause blunt trauma to the victim’s head. 

Evidences: 

Upon arriving at the scene of crime, Phoenix commented to Mia that he thought it was a bit weird the room feels the same as outside, hot, wet, and humid. Examining the heater gives you clues that it is currently turned on.

There are slight traces of blood determined by luminol on damian’s cart which transported victim’s body, traces of blood in the storage among the unused plastic bag, and traces of blood in the freezer area (again using luminol) 

The office was locked, the only ones who possess the keys are Sam Welton, Bud Welton, and Damian Stroke.

Security camera recorded when Damian transported stocks into Walmart early morning. In one of the turns, the cart seemed to leak a bit of water drops. 

Security camera recorded when Byrne exited Walmart in the evening. 

There could be more but I’m just tired now

Motivation:

Damian had a wife, Sydney, whose skin was so smooth and white that she was often nicknamed “Daisy.” Previously, she was also a blue collar worker working under Sam and Bud. She was so overworked in the industry that she had a stroke.

She then fell into a coma. At that time, Damian begged Sam to save her. Sam loaned him money to support Daisy in the monthly hospital bill. Damian has been owing large sums of money to Sam in this process.

Several days before the crime, Daisy died mysteriously on her bed. Damian seemed convinced that Sam had something to do with it. That’s why he called Sam secretly to talk with him about it. He chose the small freezing area in the back, where it’s a worker restricted area. Upon talking about it, Sam admitted that he hired an assassin to take her out. He told Damian that it’s just a simple threat, beating on a dead bush. If Damian doesn’t pay up his loans soon, Sam will also assassinate Damian’s daughter. Nobody would have believed Damian anyway, since most people know that Damian owes money to Sam.

Record: 1-0

Yesterday’s pick: **Mikal Bridges O24.5 PTS (-106)** ✅

Bridges with the comfortable cover after a phenomenal 4th quarter. I’ll admit he had me a little nervous with 17 going into the 4th quarter but he went off for 13 in trash time against one of the worst defensive teams in the league. Love to see it.

Bonus pick paid off with O1.5 3P made. Yay Mikal.

Today’s pick: **Damian Lillard U34.5 PTS (-115)**

Boston has been on a big slump since the All Star Break. They’ve been frustrating to watch as they’ve tempted me in with a few moneyline bets. I do still think the Celtics are a very good defensive team and for such a talented team that has been together a long time, they gotta be due for a bounceback game. 

This is Boston and Portland’s first meeting of the season and Lillard missed both games vs. the Celtics last year. Since the Break, Lillard has averaged slightly over 38 points a game (quite impressive!) However, if you remove his 71 point game anomaly against one of the worst defensive teams in the league (Houston), that figure drops to under 33 points a game. With Boston having a good defensive core and Lillard going against taller defenders with larger wingspans, I’m looking on the under for Lillard here.

Bonus pick: Marcus Smart U9.5 AST + REB (-136)

Smart is one of Boston’s better defenders and I expect him to matchup frequently vs Lillard. I think he’ll be out more towards the 3 point line and top of the key engaged on defense rather than fighting for boards and running the offense. Since the break, he has only broken 9.5 AST + REB in two games out of 8.

Reading that this was filed BEFORE the most recent season of Love is Blind was aired - it makes more sense that they matched Diamond up with Bartiste  

As no-one who liked diamond, would ever have done if they had seen his LIB season.  It was predictable he would use her as a stepping stone.

I feel like Francesca actually made the wrong choice. I don't like &gt;! Will !&lt; but I think he was right - he could be perfect for her. He indeed offeres a cold detached superiority reverence, but she might be the special one he sees as equal to himself.  She is exactly the same.  

Those two don't seem to ""love"" like other people
 and that's okay if they find another cold detached superiority-complexed person to rule the world along side them. 

Damian is a puppy Fran occasionally allows into her orbit to worship her. She doesn't see him as an equal and neither does he, he happily polishes her on a pedestal above him, knowing she will ditch him soon.

Maybe in another world &gt;! Fran &amp; Will !&lt; might have been the usually cold-hearted ultimate perfect matchup who only respect each other. I could truely see that working.

I think Chloe is a sweetheart who deserves good stuff. I didn't like Shayne in his LIB season, his anger is scary and high-key low key abusive.

**Season 2022 review:** Absolutely fucking not.

**Players to watch that aren't LDU:**

**Paul Curtis:** One of the brief lights in the darkness of 2022, Curtis-not-Taylor showed a lot of promise in their first year. Crafty around goal, even with the limited opportunity that this provided in 2022, could eventually become a key part of a forward line that desperately needs a small forward.

**Cameron Zurhaar:** While his forward ability is well known and established, it seems like a much larger stint in the mid could be on the horizon for the bull. There have been glimpses of this in the past and so far so good in the match sims and practice match played so far. Still a key part of the forward line though, so likely to split minutes between at best.

**Charlie Comben:** I don't want to put too much pressure on the kid, but I am so fucking excited to see him get games consistently this year. For all the talk about Larkey needing another KPF by his side, it's this guy. ""Almost 2 metre"" Charlie (gunna need to work on that nickname) takes a good contested mark, kicks a long goal. Who plays deep or CHF between the two should be interesting to see, my bets on Charlie playing deep.

**Harry Sheezel:** Harry, taken at 3, the talent is clear already. But with any first year it's a question of how it translates to the top level. Could be linking up with Paul Curtis on the regular in the forward line, but there's no rush with this kid. ""She's all that"" will certainly debut before Wardlaw, taken at 4, but that is entirely due to Wardlaw's injury recovery.

**Player's on notice:**

Bruce mourns his son's death, going slightly crazy. Tim Drake sees this and believes Batman needs a Robin, stepping in to fill that role. Meanwhile, Damian is resurrected by his mother and/or Ras.

Tim and Jason were designed in large part to try and fill the role of Dick, and while Tim was more distinct than most of Jason's original run. I think Dick is generally better, with his run as leader and founder of the Titans and being so key to carving out what/who Batman was a character and what it meant to be Robin. Just prefer the dynamic between them. Batman as the serious/brooding one and Robin as the more upbeat and friendly one.  
Damian is the opposite dynamic to what you'd traditionally expect from Robin, which is why I think his best bits have almost always been away from Batman, in year of blood, with Dick as Batman or in super sons. In all those situations Damian fulfils the same dynamic, just taking the serious role.

I'll admit Tim is the Robin I'm the least familiar with, I came into comics in the Damian period, and have looked back at the Dick Grayson stuff but not as much the Tim Drake stuff. Tim get's overlooked and is in my opinion the least famous because he stands out the least by far. What is Tim? what makes him special? The obvious answer being he's the smartest, he's the best detective, he's the most like Bruce. But the problem with those things is that ALL the Robins are tech savvy and good detectives and like Bruce (to varying degrees).

You can get through Jason's pertinent history pretty quickly. The Under the Red Hood movie covers it in about 5 minutes, but that's in a movie *about* Jason.  It takes up the whole prologue. 

Meanwhile the same movie is very comfortably able to introduce Dick with - just as you suggest - some incidental dialogue going ""That's Nightwing, the first Robin"" and we absolutely know where we are.

If they're going to introduce Damian they have to do a full introduction, and deal with Bruce's feelings about having a son, and Damian's feelings about Bruce otherwise what's the point.  And I'm not sure there's a version of that story where Jason brings added value rather than just subtracting focus. 

If you wanted to sneak Jason in without the umteenth adaptation of Under The Red Hood, you could stealth introduce him in like Waller or Supergirl or something. But honestly, as much as I like Jason, in universe where the other key pieces are Peacemaker/Waller, a bunch of antihero and The Authority, is there much need for Jason?

Some help likely will be on the way, in the buyout market. 

In the meantime, there are lessons to be learned from this largely unsatisfying and at times exasperating eight-month stretch, even for a team that has gone to six NBA Finals, won three championships and been the market’s smartest, most relevant and successful franchise for more than a quarter century. 

Before we get to those, it’s important to understand several factors that have conspired to leave the Heat in this position of pretty good (30-25) but likely not good enough to win a championship: 

**▪ Except for Caleb Martin (whom the Heat preferred to keep), all of Miami’s available trade assets regressed, got injured or stagnated.** 

Kyle Lowry deteriorated in ways that nobody could have expected, plunging from 10th in the league in assists last season to barely top 50 this season, watching his scoring average drop from nearly 20 a game to 12 in three seasons and seeing his three-point shooting percentage tumble from 40 percent two years ago to 33.3 this season. 

If Lowry had even matched his regular-season production of a year ago, perhaps the Clippers would have been motivated to further engage the Heat instead of acquiring Bones Hyland and Eric Gordon, and perhaps the Timberwolves would have offered D’Angelo Russell instead of targeting Mike Conley, who is 17 months younger than Lowry and been slightly better this season. 

If Duncan Robinson hadn’t plunged from Steph Curry-level, historic three-point shooting three years ago (44.6 percent) to 33.1 this season and hadn’t injured his finger, perhaps the Heat could have moved the remaining 3 ½ years on his five-year, $90 million contract.

If the Heat had held off on a Tyler Herro extension and thus kept him available in trade talks, perhaps he could have opened opportunities for a significant move now. Herro deserved the extension, but cap rules made it essentially impossible to deal Herro once he signed the extension, even if Miami had wanted to. Those restrictions are lifted in July. 

If Max Strus hadn’t dropped from 41.0 percent on threes to 34.4 this season, perhaps he could have been an appealing carrot to attach to another contract (Dewayne Dedmon) and a first-rounder for a skilled power forward with size and three-point range. 

But when all of your tradeable assets stagnate or regress, your assets all become distressed assets — or essentially no assets at all. 

According to a team in touch with the Heat, teams wanted two first-round picks to consider taking Robinson’s contract and a first-rounder to consider absorbing Lowry’s. Ultimately, the Clippers found better value with deals for Hyland and Gordon.

 **▪ No star player has forced his way to the Heat.**

Kevin Durant this week informed the Nets that he wanted to be dealt to Phoenix, and the Nets — eager to please him — negotiated only with the Suns, per ESPN’s Brian Windhorst. 

Even with his friendship with Bam Adebayo, Donovan Mitchell never asked the Jazz to trade him to Miami. 

Even though Washington’s Bradley Beal has expressed admiration for the Heat — telling me at one point that they’re “by far one of the best-run \[teams\] in the league” — he never asked for a trade to Miami or anywhere. 

Portland’s Damian Lillard hasn’t asked for a trade and was deemed off limits this week. 

**▪ The three-point mystery.** 

Nobody could have expected Miami to plunge from first in the league in three-point shooting (37.9 last season) to 27th at 33.6.

 If Miami shot threes at last year’s rate, they would be top six in the league in offensive rating instead of 26th. And instead of 30-25, Miami might be 34-21 and neck-and-neck with Cleveland for a top-four seed. 

**▪ Lack of sweet spot contracts to dangle in trade talks.**

Once Dedmon and his $4.7 million salary were dealt to the Spurs — who needed to take on money to reach the salary cap floor — it became impossible for Miami to trade for any players earning in the $9 million to $11 million range (such as Kelly Olynyk) without including Martin. 

Other than Lowry and Robinson and Martin, Miami had no available player earning more than $3 million except Victor Oladipo, who could veto any trade this season. That essentially tied the Heat’s hands. 

The Heat lacked the assets to make a competitive offer for Kyrie Irving, and there was vastly different opinion among the Heat’s key people about how aggressively to pursue him, according to a league source. Miami ultimately didn’t make available its best assets.

 As for lessons to be learned from the past year, here are seven of them: 

**▪ There’s always a risk with point guards who reach their mid-30s, no matter how decorated their careers.** And that’s something the Heat needs to be mindful of moving forward. 

At the time, I can’t remember any significant questioning of the Heat’s decision to give Lowry three years and $85 million. 

But there has been a clear drop-off this year with Chris Paul (37), Lowry (36) and Russell Westbrook (34). 

All of their shooting percentages have plunged this year — from 49.3 to 43.2 for Paul, and 44 to 39.6 for Lowry.

1) The first round pick is lightly protected. If Lakers draft pick somehow lands in top 4, the Lakers keep the first round pick but give up a second round pick that year. this is so key. 

2) We dump Damian Jones who was providing little to no value to this team. He had a player option for next season that he was most likely going to pick up this offseason. It unburdens us from his contract. 

3) The FRP is in 2027. It's not our 2029 pick. So there is a good chance in 4 years (AD would be 33 yo) from now we will still be contending. So this pick might be a mid to late first round pick if we are still contending. It's a strategic move on the Lakers part to give up the 2027 pick instead of 2029. 

4) D'Angelo is a free agent and eligible for an extension after this trade. If D'Angelo Russell doesn't work out for the Lakers, they can always do a sign and trade. It is totally feasible that he may traded for another super star or star this offseason. This trade gives Lakers a ton of cap room and flexibility this offseason to work with.

[],False,,BaronVonRuthless91,1433087396.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ntkb0,False,False,"Yep, there is a formula for success here that can work with a decent writer to solve the ""Robin Issue"" we currently have.

1) Give Tim his own ""Nightwing"" style name. It doesn't have to be Red Robin, but it has to be something.

2) Gradually get Tim back together with Stephanie over time, seeing as the fans have ""shipped"" them on and off for thirty years by this point. An argument could be made that they are the millennial versions of Clark/Lois or Bruce/Selina. Making it a ""slow burn"" and convincing the readers it is something worth rooting for and supporting is key here.

3) Avoid the ""they are cancelling MY Robin"" issue by having the ongoing series be simply called Gotham Knights and being a ""Bat Brothers"" book staring Tim, Damian, and Duke the same way that Batgirls stars Babs, Steph, and Cass at the moment. I would also spend some time fixing Tim and Damian's relationship as they never seemed to truly work through their issues with each other on page.

3) I would send the cast off to the next small city up the coast for college (the writer can use some excuse to get Damian involved). The city should be somehow distinct from Bludhaven and Gotham. I would name it Miskatonic and the school Tim and Duke are attending be the prestigious Miskatonic University as a homage to Lovecraft just like Arkham Asylum is. I would base the general aesthetic of the city around the ""Gothic"" section of Gotham rather than the ""urban decay"" part of Gotham that Bludhaven seems to have locked down so that you could have the creepy libraries and museums as cool backdrops for the series and also connect it back to the Lovecraft idea by having the crimes be slightly more supernatural based (i.e. ""that crime boss just brought those gargoyles to life to kill us"" or ""is that fraternity REALLY including human sacrifice as part of their hazing ritual"" rather than the ""Felix Faust just fired the Blue Pillar of Doom into the sky for the third time this week""). This city could also be slightly more ""suburban"" and have dark forests and corn fields as part of its ""thing"". It might work if the city had at least part of it with a cyberpunk aesthetic as well (maybe the highway divides the ""cyberpunk"" section from the ""gothic"" section). Making it distinct from Gotham, while having a similar feel for similar stories is crucial here.

4). Reuse supporting cast members where possible (i.e. Ives for Tim, Colin Wilkes for Damian, etc.).

5). Try to build a distinct rogues gallery or, at the very least, give the overlooked Batman rogues the ""oh crap this guy is actually dangerous"" treatment.

6) Have the characters be willing to branch out and globe trot as needed.

• Tsundere Twilight strikes again ! I bet you 5 dollars he is saying that this is for the mission but is relieved about Anya not being hurt. Anya is gonna get spoiled tonight by both Yor and Loid.

• Good for Damian that Melinda came, because after Yor showed up, if his mother didn't, he would truly feel like the most unloved kid in the world. 

• Remember that moment when Melinda came, said it's ""Yuring time"" and Yuried all over the place ? Yeah y'all ! It's uncle Yuri all over again.

And then we got that last page...

Regardless, I think Van Vleet covers this line easily and the line should be set to atleast 25 points at the very minimum.

**Naji Marshall Under 5.5 rebounds 3 units -110**

Naji Hasn't  had 6 rebounds in any of his last 8 games played he's averaging 23minutes in his past 3 games. He's on his third back to back game so except around 23 minutes playing time. The only way this hit is if he plays over 32mins in playing time but I don't see why the coach will give him that many minutes seeing when Herbert jones will play around 30minutes or more as he usually does.Sacramento Kings are 2/30 best team in the league for defensive rebounds. Actually they are first if you consider they've played 2 less games than Denver Nuggets who are first, they're only 2 rebounds allowed behind nuggets. I'll fancy this to hit especially when you have  the best rebounder in the league facing you with Sabonis. Keegan Murray is also a very good rebound point forward. I see Naji getting around 4 rebounds let's see.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1675570864.0,,1675637366.0,0.0,{},j79sw4d,False,t3_10tzuwa,False,t1_j79sw4d,False,t3_10tzuwa,/r/sportsbook/comments/10tzuwa/nba_props_2523_sunday/j79sw4d/,1678268438.0,34.0,False,True,False,sportsbook,t5_2s3v4,r/sportsbook,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],False,,Gerry-Mandarin,1412263384.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_io8pj,False,False,"In the absence of any spinoff films for the other Robin boys (which I hope there are). Every former Robin has to be a character that needs to have an apt comparison against Damian. As you say, this is an adaptation. These characters will not have the same exact history as their canon counterparts.

And all it requires for a first film is one scene with each of the former Robins.

Dick and Jason are most obvious to draw parallels with Damian. It's just good son vs bad son.

Dick represents what Damian believes he is owed as birthright. Dick represents the best of what Batman can be. He is the ideal Batman. He is Bruce's first son and will inherit the keys to the kingdom. Damian wants all of that.

Jason represents everything Damian is in danger of becoming. Jason represents Damian falling prey to the Al Ghul side of his genetics. He's lost the message of Batman. But Damian agrees with the message of Jason.

Those two work well for the character driven question of ""who could Damian become?"". It's about his end state. Will he be Batman, or the Head of the Demon?

Tim needs to be something different. Tim's character driven question for Damian is ""Who is Damian *now*? Who is he *as Robin*.""

Tim should be presented as the ideal Robin. He got the mentorship from Dick. But he had the warnings of Jason. But Tim was receptive. He didn't feel owed to be Robin, he sought it out. And he doesn't want anything to do with being Batman. He is the World's Greatest Detective.

Damian needs to examined against that framework. That he is in the shadow of Tim as Robin. Thus giving more weight to his character trait of being desperate to prove himself to his father.

Not to mention by examining each of them against Damian this way, it doubles as examination against Bruce, whilst also providing depth to each of the partnerships.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1675536696.0,,False,0.0,{},j77rh2j,False,t3_10tgjra,False,t1_j77rh2j,True,t1_j76pbbd,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/10tgjra/with_the_brave_and_the_bold_setting_up_the_bat/j77rh2j/,1678270903.0,1.0,False,True,False,DC_Cinematic,t5_2ykm6,r/DC_Cinematic,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tim (besides Batman, Alfred, and Damian) is the only other Bat-family character featured in the “Batman and Son” arc by Grant Morrison that the DCU is drawing from as its main source material for the film

Damian is already a dark character. One of the interesting things about his dynamic with Batman is it forces Bruce to be lighter since he has to 1) contrast with Robin, and 2) be the adult. A Batman who is emotionally wracked with grief and rage over the death of Jason Todd is quite hard to imagine fulfilling that role. A better adjusted Batman though who’s recovered with Tim Drake by his side can have that dynamic with Damian

Tim does play a role in Damian’s arc. In “Batman and Son” Damian feels entitled to the role of Robin as a blood right. He ridicules Tim’s status as an adopted son and even brutalizes Tim and usurps the Robin role. Damian coming to realize him being the biological son doesn’t make him better than the other Robins is a key part of his character development.

Wild this study only focuses on deaths/homicides/suicides &amp; not other crime in Australia during this time.

Strangely enough, [sexual assault against females skyrocketed immediately after the reform](https://imgur.com/a/rDBgLkB)

Assaults [in general went up](https://imgur.com/T9pIWic) following reform

[Same with robbery](https://imgur.com/dSBv7MW).... though thankfully that seems to have leveled out after a decade

While [this report] (https://www.aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/tandi359.pdf) from the AU Gov speculates violent crime may not be increasing so much as it is displaying higher rates because of a higher likelihood of reporting, it declines overall in general (along the predicted trend, again, before the 1996 reform laws)

If I had to look at these trend lines, and the date at which we observe spikes, my surface level observation would suggest the gun reform had a harsh impact in the boldness of criminals in regards to assaulting their fellow Aussies while observing an overall downward trend in violent crime in line with predictions before the reformation laws. 

On Suicides [around this time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8784240/), it's interesting to observe countries like Japan (**incredibly** limited access to firearms) holding suicide rates [doubled for men &amp; tripled for women](https://imgur.com/7UqG4FN). 

While they have [somewhat evened out in recent years](https://imgur.com/40K5Y2J)^[Source](https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/suicide-rates.htm), Covid had a pretty nasty impact on the Japanese, with more people committing suicide [**in a month** than all of Japan's Covid deaths in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html). 

All that in mind, I'm having trouble believing that banning guns would solve the suicide problem that *still exists* at a high rate in Australia as this study seems to claim. 

[Your link's key points](https://imgur.com/DxGEuT8):

&gt; A radical gun law reform occurred in Australia after a gun massacre (35 dead and 18 seriously injured) in April 1996. Semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns and rifles were banned; a tax-funded firearm buyback and amnesties saw over 700 000 guns surrendered from an adult population of about 12 million.

&gt; The total firearm deaths, firearm homicides and firearm suicides had been falling in the 18 years preceding the new gun laws. In all, 13 mass shootings were noticed in the 18 years preceding the new gun laws.

&gt; In the 10.5 years after the gun law reforms, there have been no mass shootings, but accelerated declines in annual total gun deaths and firearm suicides and a non-significant accelerated decline in firearm homicides. No substitution effects occurred for suicides or homicides.

Well that first part is just wrong.

While I expect the cherry picking of the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting) to meet whatever is most convenient to an anti-gun position at any given time, feel free to critique this list with whatever you want to use as the definition of a 'mass shooting' - the list contains many stories that meet a lot of debated criteria

Excerpt: 

The suspect in a hit-and-run crash in South Los Angeles that killed a 13-year-old boy and his baby brother has been arrested and charged with murder, police announced Thursday, capping a weeks-long investigation that spanned two states.

The crash occurred Jan. 9 after the driver of a Mercedes-Benz blew through a red light at Main Street and 111th Place in Broadway-Manchester, smashing into the car driven by Deborah Amaya, who was taking her children to their grandmother, police said. The collision resulted in the death of her two sons, Christopher Amaya-Pineda, 13, and Damian Amaya-Pineda, 18 months.

After striking Amaya’s vehicle, the driver hit two other parked cars before his vehicle burst into flames, said LAPD Det. Ryan Moreno. The driver got out and ran off.

“There were some witnesses and some good Samaritans that were there that tried to detain the suspect, but they were unsuccessful,” Moreno said.

Investigators relied on the witnesses to recall key details that helped identify the suspect, Taylor Lee Harris, who was arrested Jan. 20.

Harris was charged with two counts of murder before his arrest. He was booked in L.A. County jail last week and was being held in lieu of $4-million bond.

“I’m happy that the guy is caught,’’ Amaya said Thursday at the news conference where police announced the arrest.

“Is he ever going to bring my children back? No. But it makes me happy knowing that he’s not going to be able to do this no more to the next family or drive reckless,” she said as tears welled in her eyes. “And our goal is for him to serve life in prison, because he didn’t just take away our children for 25, 30 years. He took my kids for life.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1674826488.0,,1674832873.0,0.0,{},j63inuq,True,t3_10mkvrt,False,t1_j63inuq,False,t3_10mkvrt,/r/LosAngeles/comments/10mkvrt/driver_arrested_in_south_la_hitandrun_crash_that/j63inuq/,1676097154.0,300.0,False,True,False,LosAngeles,t5_2qht0,r/LosAngeles,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The return of the Teen Titans! The team from the first film returns (Nightwing, Donna Troy, Beast Boy, Cyborg, and Impulse), alongside some new faces. Those being Raven, Robin, Superboy, Starfire, and Terra. Constantine makes a cameo, talking to Batman earlier on in the film regarding what to do with Raven. He recommends if Constantine isn’t getting to her, perhaps the Titans could, telling him he’ll be sending Damian to work with them. When Batman drops off Robin &amp; Raven to the newly formed Titans tower, we already see Superboy and Terra to be there, training alongside the others. The duo get acquainted with the Titans, with Beast Boy throwing them a party. It’s even implied in these scenes that both BB &amp; Terra have feelings for one another. Throughout the film we see Raven struggle with her powers, as the more she uses them, the more she continues to see visions of a red beast killing those she cares about. She doesn’t go on much more, but Nightwing wonders if there is a way to control this. Whilst the party goes on, something lands in Jump City, with the Mayor informing Nightwing to come check it out. The group find Starfire, an alien princess (whose origins were formerly explored in her own solo series). Starfire explains that she was informed to go to Earth via a prophecy that made reference to the being Raven keeps seeing. The prophecy dates back far beyond humanity, with even Donna Troy hearing about it to some degree via the Amazons. Starfire recounts the tale of Trigon, said to be one of the remaining Lords of Chaos. Through several scenes, the team try to help Raven, showing her the goodness of the world, along with trying to get Damian to trust his peers. The team have little time to focus on this though, as they have to deal with a break-in at a local art museum via the villain Mad Mod. As they combat Mod, he reveals that he was merely an obstacle for the Titans. For who he doesn’t disclose yet, until he suddenly begins to age rapidly, and reveals his ties to the Church of Blood, a cult who worships Trigon, and uses a variant of Gotham’s Lazarus Pits to achieve eternal youth. It’s head priest is known as Brother Sebastian Blood, a teacher at the H.I.V.E. Academy, which is a home for troubled youth, praised for its academic honors. It’s revealed that Sebastian is quite possibly thousands of years old, and has been simply altering his look with every generation to fool people. Brother Blood sees Raven as the key to Trigon’s return, especially after finding out she is the child the prophecy foretold of. The Titans infiltrate H.I.V.E. in the hopes of ambushing Brother Blood, but are instead met with the, “H.I.V.E Five,” which are a group of the school’s “talented students,” which consist of the villains Gizmo, Mammoth, and Kyd Wykyyd. The Titans make quick work of them, but Brother Blood ultimately has the upper hand, being able to manipulate Raven through a spell involving her head gem and his magical blood. The Titans eventually defeat Brother Blood, but not before he manages to make contact with Trigon. There is now no stopping his arrival, and with quest complete, he takes his own life. The new Titans are left in shambles, wondering what will happen now that Trigon is on his way to Earth.

Some kids won't learn without a spanking, spare the rod, spoil the child. This isn't ""Child abuse"" for these characters who survive superhuman attacks, this is simply a lesson, nothing out of the ordinary, you'd never see Jason do this to an ACTUAL child, idk if you noticed but Damian's NOT your regular child, according to Nightwing he can murder a man with a piece of paper. Exaggeration or not, would you consider a tap on the shoulder ""Abuse"" Damian has been through far worse. Damian don't want his empathy, his sympathy, his harmony and Jason is fully aware of what Damian can do.

&gt;Not that humiliation is a viable tatic in the long run either. Thats just a host of other issues. 

Where would Jason get a rope on short notice, what good would ""restraining"" him do in the long run when he declared he's going to capture him? The Robins have been trained in the art of escape artistry, so, a rope or even himself ""Halarasly sitting on him"" wouldn't keep down for long.

So, this isn't about an ""OOC"" moment of Jason Todd, just a Jason fanboy's strange obsession with a certain writer? Winick's the savior of you guys, huh? Where would he get a hogtie rope in a random encounter while drunk? Also, wouldn't sitting on him still hurt and be somewhat CA Though?

As Batman ages up, I wouldn't mind seeing him in the cave, training, mentoring, and monitoring the younger heroes. Between the Batpack, We Are Robin, and his numerous sidekicks, he could have a really great organized force on the streets that could lead to a nice operatic tale. If any of the heroes should trust the next generation, **it should be Batman**. And I think that's part of where I'm at with his story. I want to stop flirting with him trusting the next generation but really employ them, get them on the streets, and support them.

But when we're digging into a Batman story, I think we need a couple of key things and it all comes down to a Sherlock Holmes story.

We need the femme fatale that offers Bruce the out from being the detective, the butler/supporter at home that tries to temper Bruce, the hard laced cop who doesn't see it, the Watson sidekick who is learning and amazed by Bruce's abilities, and a really complex villain that we learn layers to. They're not just evil, but there's nuance and cause that drives them down their path that Bruce uncovers. 

So who should these characters be now?

Renee Montoya can fill in for Gordon. Great detective in her own right, so the dynamic would be intriguing.

With Alfred gone, Bruce needs a sort of caretaker. Not because he's rich and can't do anything, but because the story demands he needs a non-in-the-field-friend to think through. Harold Allnut, his mechanic, could come back. Julia Pennyworth could fill in - she could spar with Bruce, tend to his wounds, help him through his cases. Cullen Row could get hired in as an aid to clean, upkeep, etc and starts filling a role as Penny 3. Or we could go in a whole new direction. Bring in Van Wayne who accidentally discovers the secret and is trying to learn and support Bruce, even if he doesn't want it.

Selina is great for the femme fatale, and maybe we can hit it on the nose. She wants Bruce to retire and travel the world with her, and when she shows up, that's her offer. In the meantime, a new vigilante on the streets could tempt Bruce away. Perhaps a woman heir to Orpheus.

The Watson sidekick was great as Robin with Damian and Tim in the role. But I think it's time for them both to move on a bit. Between Harper, Claire, the Batpack, Silverlocke, we have a lot of youthful characters that would be great to mentor. Maybe it should rotate for a couple of years as he takes on various teen sidekicks to test and train them. So while they're all ""there,"" the stories shift through who is the Watson on the case.

And new villains. Not just ""we're going to destroy Bruce's whole world!"" sort of Hush/Bane villains. Those are great, but honestly characters that fall through the cracks of society help shape Bruce. His best villains reflect him, and more villains should be made to reflect his sidekicks and supporting cast. Build it out and show these dark reflections. Take real world issues and show how so many of his casts are just... basically Walter White's.

Generally the benchmarks most people suggest for being ""ready"" to run / complete the first three Impossible (""Shores"") mines under 24 hours are:

1. At least two Rare SMs with Mine Income Factor passives (Turner / Sue / Zi / Damian) to level 30 promoted for their production / income multiplier passives. 
2. Legendary Collectibles / Outfits to 3 / 3 / 3.
3. Have all 40 bronze keys necessary to unlock all three mines forged (this is because by this point in your mining career you've probably accrued and levelled up enough Super Managers to complete all three mines).
4. Have at least one Epic SM, preferably a mineshaft SM (eg Steiner, Ezio).

Again, these are all suggested benchmarks and a lot of people have said they've completed all three mines without all of the above in place. However they're also good indicators of when you are really ""ready"" to complete these mines without using any big boosts or dropping hundreds of Insta Cash tokens (having reached all the above milestones, you really shouldn't need to use anything bigger than 20x boosts to comfortably complete them under par).

From there, most successful strategies include a combination of mainly Shaft Ahead with some Balanced. However if you only have Epic elevator or warehouse SMs, it is possible to complete the mines using a Shaft Behind strategy, but it is a lot trickier and requires a lot more active management of the mine throughout than Shaft Ahead / Balanced strategies. 

One key thing to remember about these three mines is that the first 25 mineshafts are **not** the issue; it's the last five. Most players find it's easy to breeze through the first 20 or so mineshafts but then get a shock at the severe difficulty curve for the last 5 - 10.

So the biggest thing I can personally recommend is time management: open the first 25 mineshafts as quickly as possible to get the last barrier out of the way (one piece of advice is to schedule the last barrier to happen overnight so you can sleep through most of it), and then make sure you have the time free (anywhere from 1 - 4 hours) to sit down and focus on maxing the last five mines (MS30 in particular).

Looks like you're not far off, and you could probably manage it, but I'd daresay you'll likely sink a lot of big boosts and insta cash tokens in the process..... 

And then you still have two more mines to go before it's even worth it.

[],False,,momomo_mochichi,1671381637.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_v26i2hly,False,False,"Haha, my unpopular opinions are extremely contentious, no? I’m not sure if this is because Bookworm is a light novel community or if their fanbase is exponentially smaller to other franchises, but even in Japan they only like Ferdinand and Rozemyne together (and Rozemyne and Lestilaut which I fortunately like), when Japanese fandoms are always exploring non canon ships.

I first got into Bookworm via the anime, and that first episode, I immediately knew that Ferdinand was the endgame for Myne and completely despised it.

And here are some more unpopular opinions courtesy of yours truly with spoilers of untranslated content:

1. &gt;!I don’t like Lutz and Tuuli ending up together. I actually like Lutz and Freida together. And Tuuli could probably end up with Damian. I think it would strengthen the bonds between nobles and commoners if Rozemyne helped Freida dissolve her contact with Henrik. Their families would still be of use to each other, but they wouldn’t be forced to have Freida become Henrik’s concubine.!&lt;
2. &gt;!I don’t like Philine with Damuel. I think it’s funnier if Damuel remains an eternal bachelor and Philine ends up with Roderick.!&lt;
3. &gt;!That visit to Leisegang in late part 4 should have ended with Rozemyne lecturing Count Leisegang alone with her Leisegang retainers that if the former Count Leisegang is so hellbent and immature, then he should just retire to a little farm and never get involved into politics ever again. This will be Rozemyne giving the Leisegangs a huge warning that she does not appreciate their efforts whatsoever.!&lt;
4. &gt;!Sylvester’s fourth child doesn’t exist.!&lt;
5. &gt;!Brunhilde, Judithe, Muriella, and Bertilde should have stayed Rozemyne’s retainers.!&lt;
6. &gt;!It would have been funnier if Sigiswald and Adolphine mutually did everything they could to postpone their marriage, ultimately ending with Adolphine not marrying into the royal family, being gifted with the western portion of the Sovereignty with their support for her being the next Aub Drewanchel.!&lt;
7. &gt;!Ehrenfest should have surpassed Ahrensbach in the rankings in Rozemyne’s third year. With the proper groundwork, I believe the major players of Ehrenfest could be whipped into shape.!&lt;
8. &gt;!Rozemyne’s entire third year should show the cracks of how Ehrenfest hates Ahrensbach, with everything building up to total humiliation for Detlinde at the Interduchy Tournament. Detlinde will not be a Zent Candidate (remember, in my fix-it a/u, Ferdinand isn’t one) but just miserably messes up at whirling. Then, come being escorted for her graduation, Ferdinand dumps Detlinde in front of everybody lined up to graduate, leaving her without an escort. This will work because Ferdinand being in Ahrensbach was a form of espionage so that Ehrenfest can acquire Ahrensbach.!&lt;
9. &gt;!Bride-stealing ditter should have never happened. Wilfried should have stepped up and display full noble trickery on Lestilaut, and Hannelore should have contacted her parents to stop the ditter as Rozemyne is so utterly distressed that upon realizing that she may need to leave Ehrenfest, Rozemyne immediately cowers and starts shuddering in fear. This sight makes Wilfried extremely mad as he tells Lestilaut that the two of them will leave, supporting Rozemyne until she’s able to safely return to the Ehrenfest dormitory. Bride-stealing ditter should have instead been a treasure-stealing ditter demonstration in Rozemyne’s fourth year at the Interduchy Tournament (oh yeah, in my fix-it a/u, Rozemyne being kidnapped by the former gods lasts days on her end, but like three days at most for those in the real world. Her reappearance causes Charlotte to break down in tears at the academy, going to hug her and having them collapse onto the ground because of how intense Charlotte’s emotions are. This is also the moment Wilfried realizes he has feelings for Rozemyne and immediately begins to pursue her, to which Rozemyne doesn’t realize, and betters himself). At the fourth year Interduchy Tournament, Wilfried and Rozemyne are key players to Ehrenfest’s team, and Hannelore is representing Dunkelfelger. To even things out, Lestilaut as a graduated student, is allowed to coach Dunkelfelger’s knights on the sidelines.!&lt;
10. &gt;!Duchy rankings changes starting with Rozemyne’s third year:!&lt;

&gt;!Third year: Klassenberg, Dunkelfelger, Drewanchel, Gilessenmeyer, Hauchletzte, Ehrenfest, Ahrensbach!&lt;

&gt;!Fourth year: Dunkelfelger, Klassenberg, Drewanchel, Ehrenfest, Gilessenmeyer, Hauchletze, Gaussbuttel!&lt;

&gt;Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, along with Kristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, announced today that the Justice Department has reached a key milestone in its settlement agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”), formerly known as Facebook, Inc., requiring Meta to change its ad delivery system to prevent discriminatory advertising in violation of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”). As required by the settlement entered on June 27, 2022, resolving a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Meta has now built a new system to address algorithmic discrimination. Today, the parties informed the Court that they have reached agreement on the system’s compliance targets. This development ensures that Meta will be subject to court oversight and regular review of its compliance with the settlement through June 27, 2026.

Otherwise it would just be vapid fanservice. Cassandra Cain is a character who has suffered both from direct mistreatment by editorial and indirectly due to Batman’s mistreatment. 

* She had a great origin story in one of the all-time greatest Batman crossover events in *No Man’s Land*. That event should’ve set the stage for a great new era of Batman and the Bat-family. Unfortunately the leadership and creators of the decade prior were phased out. The new team that replaced them decided to write Batman into the ground by making him unlikeable to the nth degree. A trend that didn’t end until editors and creators finally changed again around 2006. 

* So b/c of that, Cass’ relationship with Batman ended up being fairly piss poor like most of Batman’s relationships at the time. Her 50th issue, a number which is normally something positive and celebratory, was a nasty fight between her and Batman. She was then away from many of the big events and storylines of the era, which honestly was probably for the best.

* However by the time Batman and the Bat-books turned things around 2006/7, she was completely sidelined. She got a brief 2008 miniseries. She had been derailed by going “evil” and had to redeem herself sort of. 

* By that time though the Batman world was long focused on other things. R.I.P., Final Crisis, Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne as the new Dynamic Duo, etc. Again Cass wasn’t key to any of those central events and stories. 

* Eventually Batman returned from being lost in time and then created Batman Inc, and the Bat-family finally got back together like in the old days. But Cass mainly operated elsewhere and was no longer Batgirl. Again she was not connected to the center of things. 

* Then the New 52 reboot happened. Cass was one of those characters temporarily erased. She returned in the 2015 Batman &amp; Robin Eternal event, during which Bruce had amnesia and wasn’t Batman. 

* She got more play in Tynion’s Rebirth ‘Tec run. Now she’s in the Batgirls book.

The purpose of playing each mine is to earn medals, and medals are the only way to unlock Legendary Super Managers (Lorenzo, Stella and Luna, and Professor Impossible).

You can earn a total of 3 medals from each impossible mine you complete: 3 medals for completing the mine in under 24 hours, 2 for 72 hours, and 1 medal for completing the mine in any time over 72 hours. 

If you dont complete the mine under any of those time limits, you can try again, and if you succeed on a subsequent run you will pick up the medals you missed out on previously. However, you can only earn a total of 3 medals per mine, so once you've got all three, there is *absolutely no reason* to replay that mine.

I almost didn't finish Dark Shores in under 24 hours because I didn't take that seriously (I was out and not playing right in the middle of the last few hours and it ended up coming right down to the wire). Once I realised my error there, the second two mines were much less stressful.

The sidekicks:
1) The Current Robin: this is *the* current robin. There should only ever be one. My favourites include Dick Grayson, Tim Drake, and Carrie Kelley. Honestly, the only one I don't like is Damian. But regardless of who, one Robin -only-

2) The Current Batgirl: in future, this doesn't have to be a Batgirl per se. But this character is Semi independent. The rely on Batman at a structural level, but also pursue independent leads. Barb Gordon is a great example. She has her own life, family, motivations, and means. Ultimately she is better working with Batman. The Batgirl is an independent hero who benefits from Batman's tutelage, but isn't structurally bound to Batman the way a Robin is.

3) The Retired Robin: the retired Robin is usually an independent hero operating in a new city. They create the template for the current Robin, serve both as foil and mirror. Traditionally this is Nightwing. Often there is some personal conflict which drove them apart from Batman, and part of their duty is to highlight Batman's dysfunctionality as a person. They are very good at what they do.

4*) Pennyworth. Also acceptable is Ace the ""Bathound"" when not engaged in heroics. A personal companion who isn't out fighting the night, they are a guardian and barometer of Bruce/Batman's emotional health and a grounding rod.

####### Bat Aligned Persons #######

The Bat Aligned Persons are regularish characters who are either antagonistic heroes who help define what Batman isn't (when present with Batman, of course) are in on the general secret, or otherwise have privaledged Bat information, or otherwise are structurally in Batman's orbit. These are other, less involved retired Robins, other Heroes in the city, and vital non-hero persons. In a Batman story arc this might mean Lucian Fox, or Superman, or Batwoman, or plenty of others. The key here is that they shouldn't be central to the Bat mythos at the time. I shouldn't need to *know* who these characters are, though knowing them won't hurt. They are functional.

1. At least two Rare SMs with Mine Income Factor passives (Turner / Sue / Zi / Damian) to level 30 promoted for their production / income multiplier passives. 
2. Legendary Collectibles / Outfits to 3 / 3 / 3.
3. Have all 40 bronze keys necessary to unlock all three mines forged (this is because by this point in your mining career you've probably accrued and levelled up enough Super Managers to complete all three mines).
4. Have at least one Epic SM, preferably a mineshaft SM (eg Steiner, Ezio, Green Idler).

Again, these are all suggested benchmarks and a lot of people have said they've completed all three mines without all of the above in place. However they're also good indicators of when you are really ""ready"" to complete these mines without using any big boosts or dropping hundreds of Insta Cash tokens (having reached all the above milestones, you really shouldn't need to use anything bigger than 20x boosts to comfortably complete them under par).

From there, most successful strategies include a combination of mainly Shaft Ahead with some Balanced. However if you only have Epic elevator or warehouse SMs, it is possible to complete the mines using a Shaft Behind strategy, but it is a lot trickier and requires a lot more active management of the mine throughout than Shaft Ahead / Balanced strategies.

One key thing to remember about these three mines is that the first 25 mineshafts are **not** the issue; it's the last five. Most players find it's easy to breeze through the first 20 or so mineshafts but then get a shock at the severe difficulty curve for the last 5 - 10.

So the biggest thing I can personally recommend is time management: open the first 25 mineshafts as quickly as possible to get the last barrier out of the way (one piece of advice is to schedule the last barrier to happen overnight so you can sleep through most of it), and then make sure you have the time free (anywhere from 1 - 4 hours) to sit down and focus on maxing the last five mines (MS30 in particular).

I almost didn't finish Dark Shores in under 24 hours because I didn't take that seriously (I was out and not playing right in the middle of the last few hours and it ended up coming right down to the wire). Once I realised my error there, the second two mines were much less stressful.

For those who read and enjoyed my post-apocalyptic superhero trilogy, The Murder of Crows ([See These Bones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YBVN74N), [Red Right Hand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JJL74YS), and [One Tin Soldier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09723N9GY)), I decided to give out an extra Christmas gift this year... a free short story called [Only the Dead Remain](https://storyoriginapp.com/directdownloads/6038fb1f-3a7d-4ca0-ba63-47efd449f0e3).

Set in the gap between One Tin Soldier's final chapter and epilogue (no spoilers for those who haven't read it), *Only the Dead Remain* is a quick peek into a pivotal encounter for the series' protagonist, Damian Banach... something a lot of readers have been asking for since *One Tin Soldier* dropped last year.

The story is free to download in PDF, epub, and mobi formats from StoryOrigin: [here](https://storyoriginapp.com/directdownloads/6038fb1f-3a7d-4ca0-ba63-47efd449f0e3).

Fair warning: if you *haven't* read the trilogy, the short (very short!) story won't make a lick of sense to you. It also contains some serious spoilers for that series. I would not recommend reading this short story first.

However, the series starter, [*See These Bones*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YBVN74N)*,* is currently on sale for $0.99/£0.99 in the US/UK markets as part of the indie author [charity sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/zvmmxt/over_450_books_free_or_099_almost_175/), and it and its sequels (and everything else I write) are always free to read on Kindle Unlimited.

Here's the blurb for *See These Bones*:

&gt;Some superheroes want to save the world. Damian is just hoping to save himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the post-Break world of superpowers, necromancy is the one gift nobody wants. Everyone knows what happens to Crows; they go mad and they go bad. That's the story of infamous mass murderers like Crimson Death, Gravedigger, and Sally Cemetery. It's also the story of David Jameson, an otherwise unremarkable man who came home one day and killed his wife, orphaning their five-year-old son, Damian.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thirteen years later, Damian has inherited more than just grey eyes and a beak of a nose from his father. He too is a Crow, doomed to become a killer unless he can find a way to avoid the violent madness endemic to his powers. When a Finder offers enrollment at Los Angeles' Academy of Superheroes, he jumps at the chance, believing training could be the key to changing his fate. His classmates despise him, the majority of his teachers want him expelled, and his mom's ghost hasn't said a word since reappearing when he was nine, but Damian isn't the kind to give up. He's going to take control of his destiny or die in the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's that or end up like his father.  
&gt;  
&gt;*See These Bones* is a post-apocalyptic, superhero, coming-of-age ghost story... with expletives.

Bruce is taken aback and a bit suspicious but doesn't stop them, ordering Damian to stand down as well. Gomez introduces Lurch to Alfred and tells the two butlers that they'll get along swimmingly. Lurch groans and Alfred makes a dry quip about the sparkling conversation.

Meanwhile, the kids are starting to mingle. Damian and Wednesday instantly become friends, something that genuinely concerns Tim for the sake of everyone's lives. Pugsley is busy playing with Ace the Bathound.

Gomez is busy admiring Bruce's study as Bruce tries his best to make him feel welcome. Unfortunately, Gomez is more than experienced with trap doors, secret passages and the mechanisms that trigger them. So he immediately identifies every book or statue that could open one and starts messing with them. The Batcave opens. Bruce is stunned. But Gomez is more amused by the bats, caverns and batpoles than his neighbors secret. So when it becomes apparent that the secret means a lot to Bruce, Gomez swears on his gentleman's honor never to tell anyone. He then notices Bruce's collection of swords and insists they fence.

Upstairs, Mortica and Selina (I'm assuming Bruce is with Catwoman in this) are bonding over their shared love of whips, tight clothing and other kinky stuff. Damian is developing a crush on Wednesday, who's looking over his grandfather's old medical tools. Fester is mistaken for Danny Devito's Penguin and takes control of the sewers. Grandma Addams spends the night admiring Wayne Manor's cemetery.

The thing about the Addams family is that they're generally nice people who just live a different lifestyle. Their motto is ""We Gladly Feast on Those Who Would Subdue Us"" key words being 'those who would subdue us'. While their tendency to unjustifiably kill or maim varies with every iteration, they're generally not super murdery unless provoked.

Biddy had wanted to prevent the government from having the power to silence and oppress its citizens. This act of terrorism from Billy's Red Circus is only adding fuel to the fire Biddy had died fighting - the SSS will use events like these to justify cracking down even harder on the people in the future. Put another way: the current Red Circus has lost sight of what it was they had originally fought for. Their actions now are achieving nothing but spit on Biddy's memory.

Of course this is my responsibility, but I came to the painful realization that impossible to completely control children. I guess a parent shouldn't assume they can control their child. It's not good to have so many one sided hopes and disappointments. Raising a child is truly difficult. 

&gt;Desmond: You are correct. In the end the child that shares your blood is a stranger. It is simply impossible to understand what someone else is truly thinking. People will never be able to truly understand each other.

Those shadows over his eyes WTF..

Is that who you really are, Desmond? ) Upi are absolutely right! ^_^ I specialize in psychiatry, but I fear that I may not truly be able to understand what my patients are feeling. It's true, talking it out is nothing but pure idealism. It might be sheer arrogance to think you can truly understand another.

Thinking back on Donovan Desmond. He's indeed elusive. It might be quicker to work from the outside in. I need to take the intel I gainted today back to SQ so we can discuss it. 



And the very last scene is so cute! 

&gt;Yor: Welcome home, Loid! (Anya:zzzzz) She came home fast asleep for some reason and she's been asleep ever since. (Becky: Delivery for you!) 

&gt;Anya: Papa... Anya's going to fight the boss, too...

&gt;Loid: She doesn't have a care in the world. And... I have absolutely no idea what she's talking about. 


I'm so looking forward to more Spy X Family! This is  a very fun show with a *Lot* of heart. Maybe I should get into the mangas while we wait!

Really good and wholesome e  episode! Really cool how Loid was so 'under the radar' trying his best to figure out Donovan.

And Damian is trying to meet with his dad at the School event, but he's bracing for disappointment...

&gt;Damian: H-Hey, bro. (What do you want?) Oh sorry. About tomorrow... You're going to the social gathering, right? (Yeah) When you see father, there's something I'd like you to ask him.  I was wondering if I could see him, even just for a little bit, after the gathering. Can you tell him I'll be waiting in the courtyard of Library 2? (Don't get your hopes up, father's busy). Yeah.... 



And all the girls are trying to meet Damian's dad. But he turns them down. 

&gt;Anya: Is second son planning to meet with the evil boss today? (Becky: Hey want to go shopping again today?) Anya's plan to use fassun on Second Son failed. Which means... I'll follow second son and fight the evil boss myself. 

And Damian notices her candid sneeking!

&gt;What the hell have you been up to all week?! You're creepy stop following me!! &gt;:( ... You stupid uggo! Stubby-legged uggo! Don't ever come near me again! You creepy Gorilla-girl stalker! 

WOW that was mega harsh damian-san! 

&gt;Anya: Anya is thinking of punching him again. 

&gt;Becky: Don't. You'll get expelled.

Tell it straight to her!

And now Anya is hearing papa's thoughts while at school! Thisgonnagetgood.jpg



&gt;Loid: As I feared, she's still not getting along with Damian. (PAPA?!) No, perhaps she's trying to make up with him in her own way. Well done. For now, I need to find Damian, who may encounter his father outside the venue. 

&gt;Anya: Wait! Anywa will fight the evil boss, too! 

But she went the wrong way...

And Loid is making close surveillance of Damian... 

&gt;Loid: So he is *meeting with his father*.  Excellent. 


&gt;Damian lackey: Imperial scholars! I may pee my pants!


And just as Damian is about to call off the meeting entirely, Anya steps in! 

&gt;(I'll tell him to cancel the meetup.) Anya: That's not happening! (What's your problem? You're still here, you stalker?) Second son is scared. Anya can tell. (Huh?! Wh-what's with her? Is she actually reading my mind?)

*Shocked anya*
&gt;A-Anya knows  that, um... That you only got 50 points on our las tlanguage test. 

*Damian taken aback*
&gt;Damian: H-How do you know that?! Wait that has nothing to do with anything. (I peeked over your shoulder.)

&gt;Becky: Anya's become an actual stalker. 

&gt;Anya: You're scared that your father will find out that you did bad on your test. Anya totally understands because she only got 17 points. (Don't lump me in with you!)  Anya's a little scared because she's not sure if Papa loves her or not. He always gets mad at me (Papa: Anya...) But I believe in him because I love him. And so... Anya always shows him her tests if even if they're bad...


And that was such an inspiring speech from Anya-chan!!  And papa praised her in secret too and Damian decides to wait for father in the courtyard! Great success!!

&gt;Loid: I'm not quite sure what happened but well done, Anya! Her provocation worked in my favor! 

&gt;Becky: Huh? You're going to wait too? Why?! My car's waiting so let's just go home! Wait! Is she planning on meeting his parents because she's trying to marry him? She's serious! You must be serious, Anya-chan! All right, Anya. I'll wait with you! I will see your resolve through!

*And Anya is passed out snoozing!*

&gt;Becky: I was wrong. She's not serious at all. Martha! Carry Anya to the car! We're going home! (As you wish.) 

And Becky says a polite goodbye to Loid in disguise, and he shows off the replica  sheep keychain he made for much much cheaper...

&gt;Twilight: Oh, pardon me, boys. Did you happen to see a sheep key chain around here? It's apparently very important to my daughter. But she seems to have dropped it around here, (Damian: Oh, is this it? It was on the ground over there.) Oh that's definitely it, you're a lifesaver. 

*After Damian introduces himself properly*

&gt;Loid: I'm terribly sorry!!I'm sorry for what my daughter did on the day of the entrance ceremony! I wanted to vist your home to apologize, But I wasn't able to see you or your parents, so it's been on my mind all this time. (I mean, I live in the dorms.) I'm responsible for my daughter's rudeness. I'm sorry. 

&gt;Damian: Uh, it's fine. (I would still like to apologize to your parents.) (Ah, Lord Damian over there, your father!) 

Twilight: I'm truly sorry, Damian.   For the sake of my mission I'll be butting into your reunion with your father for a bit. 

&gt;Desmond: It's all right. what is it? 

&gt;Twilight: I've been wanting to apologize for my daughter's rudeness to your son. Oh I haven't properly introduced myself I'm... Loid Forger.

*First contact*



....

Thirty minutes later you'll be tortured in their interrogation room. If we send in inexperienced agents, we'll just be giving them easy prey. Don't forget that we're right in the middle of enemy territory. Currently, that school... is the front line of this cold war. 


&gt;Twilight: I'm Loid Forger. I'm a doctor who works at Berlint Central Hospital. I would like to formally apologize for my daughter being violent with Damian. I'm sure it must have been very u npleasant for Damian and the rest of your family. 

*Chairman Desmond of the National Unity Party. His past quotes found in newspapers and TV broadcasts, books he's written, I've studied everything that might give me insight into his life. But it's been impossible to learn anything about him since he went into hiding. How can I get closer to him? How can I get him to show any interest in Loid? What does he relate to? What enrages him? I will have to find that out in this conversation. And then, eventually, I will find what's inside him. And learn all about his plan for war.*

&gt;I'm truly sorry and I would like to visit your residence to formally apologize. 

And Desmond barely cares about it at all!

&gt;Desmond: Ah, so it was you. My staff informed me about that incident. I've been so busy that I haven't had time to address it. Sorry about that. 



And after apologizing, Loid confessess of Anya's eccentricity. 

 	&gt;I'll be sure to lecture her properly so this never happens again. Then again, my daughter is rather eccentric, so I'm honestly not sure what to do with ehr. Of course this is my responsibility, but I came to the painful realization that impossible to completely control children. I guess a parent shouldn't assume they can control their child. It's not good to have so many one sided hopes and disappointments. Raising a child is truly difficult. 

&gt;Desmond: You are correct. In the end the child that shares your blood is a stranger. It is simply impossible to understand what someone else is truly thinking. People will never be able to truly understand each other.

Those shadows over his eyes WTF..

&gt;Loid: (And that's why you're using force to bring other nations to their knees? Is that who you really are, Desmond? ) Upi are absolutely right! ^_^ I specialize in psychiatry, but I fear that I may not truly be able to understand what my patients are feeling. It's true, talking it out is nothing but pure idealism. It might be sheer arrogance to think you can truly understand another. But what's truly important is to continue walking beside them despite that. The things Anya says and does are truly a mystery to me.

*Fantasy*

&gt;Anya is going to free some candy hostages at the candy store with this coupon.

1) Give Tim his own ""Nightwing"" style name. It doesn't have to be Red Robin, but it has to be something.

2) Gradually get Tim back together with Stephanie over time, seeing as the fans have ""shipped"" them on and off for thirty years by this point.  An argument could be made that they are the millennial versions of Clark/Lois or Bruce/Selina. Making it a ""slow burn"" and convincing the readers it is something worth rooting for and supporting is key here.

3) Avoid the ""they are cancelling MY Robin"" issue by having the ongoing series be simply called Gotham Knights and being a ""Bat Brothers"" book staring Tim, Damian, and Duke the same way that Batgirls stars Babs, Steph, and Cass at the moment. I would also spend some time fixing Tim and Damian's relationship as they never seemed to truly work through their issues with each other on page.

3) I would send the cast off to the next small city up the coast for college (the writer can use some excuse to get Damian involved). The city should be somehow distinct from Bludhaven and Gotham. I would name it Miskatonic and the school Tim and Duke are attending be the prestigious Miskatonic University as a homage to Lovecraft just like Arkham Asylum is. I would base the general aesthetic of the city around the ""Gothic"" section of Gotham rather than the ""urban decay"" part of Gotham that Bludhaven seems to have locked down so that you could have the creepy libraries and museums as cool backdrops for the series and also connect it back to the Lovecraft idea by having the crimes be slightly more supernatural based (i.e. ""that crime boss just brought those gargoyles to life to kill us"" or ""is that fraternity REALLY including human sacrifice as part of their hazing ritual"" rather than the ""Felix Faust just fired the Blue Pillar of Doom into the sky for the third time this week""). This city could also be slightly more ""suburban"" and have dark forests and corn fields as part of its ""thing"".  It might work if the city had at least part of it with a cyberpunk aesthetic as well (maybe the highway divides the ""cyberpunk"" section from the ""gothic"" section).  Making it distinct from Gotham, while having a similar feel for similar stories is crucial here.

4). Reuse supporting cast members where possible (i.e. Ives for Tim, Colin Wilkes for Damian, etc.).

5). Try to build a distinct rogues gallery or, at the very least, give the overlooked Batman rogues the ""oh crap this guy is actually dangerous"" treatment.

6) Have the characters be willing to branch out and globe trot as needed.

[],False,,oldmanbrown-plancta,1633277465.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_f34fqe3j,False,False,"NEW YORK — Disgraced former cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was granted release from law enforcement custody on Thursday after agreeing in his first U.S. court appearance to post a $250 million bond and remain confined to his parents’ home in Palo Alto, Calif.  
The former chief executive of collapsed crypto exchange FTX is due back in Manhattan federal court on Jan. 3 for his arraignment, where he will enter a plea to the eight criminal counts he is facing. Bankman-Fried declined to comment after the proceedings, as did his lawyers and parents, Joe Bankman and Susan Fried, both of whom are prominent professors at Stanford Law School.  
The 30-year-old, clad in a charcoal suit and sporting stubble along with his trademark unkempt hair, came into the courtroom in leg shackles, as his parents looked on from the third row. He only spoke a few words during the hearing. When asked by the judge if he understood that if he broke any of the terms of his release, his parents will forfeit $250 million and he would be charged with bail jumping, he said, “Yes, I do.”  
Bankman-Fried is accused of perpetrating one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. Federal prosecutors last week charged him with multiple crimes, including fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and campaign finance violations. They allege he defrauded investors and diverted billions of dollars in FTX customer money to his hedge fund, which he then tapped for huge real estate purchases, risky investments and political donations.  
The Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also brought civil charges against Bankman-Fried, alleging he orchestrated a years-long scheme to siphon off FTX customer funds he pledged to safeguard for personal use instead.  
Bankman-Fried was taken into U.S. custody on Wednesday and flown to New York under FBI supervision after waiving his rights to formal extradition from the Bahamas, which had been his home-base. Bahamian authorities arrested the former multibillionaire last Monday at his luxury condo in Nassau, and he spent the next nine nights in the island nation’s only prison.

FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried  
What charges is Sam Bankman-Fried facing?  
Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York unsealed an eight-count indictment against Bankman-Fried, alleging fraud and conspiracy.  
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed fraud charges against him, seeking restitution for investors and customers in civil court.  
The Securities and Exchange Commission lobbed its own civil charges at Bankman-Fried for allegedly “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.”  
‘Plain old embezzlement’  
Sam Bankman-Fried dropped his objection to extradition from the Bahamas and is expected to face charges in a federal court in Manhattan.  
FTX customers will not fully recover their money, the company’s new CEO, John J. Ray III, told the House Financial Services Committee.  
Ray sees the alleged crimes of the crypto company’s collapse as simple, despite the seemingly complex nature of the circumstances. “This isn’t sophisticated whatsoever. This is just plain old embezzlement,” he said.  
What does this mean for the crypto industry?  
Bankman-Fried gave about $40 million in political donations this cycle. See who benefited.  
The collapse has focused new scrutiny on the lack of oversight and regulation in an industry that has operated outside conventional banking rules.  
1/3  
End of carousel  
Bankman-Fried’s appearance comes as two of his closest former colleagues pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges. The two associates — Caroline Ellison, the former chief executive of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, and Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX and its former chief technology officer — are cooperating with federal prosecutors, a development that spells deepening legal peril for Bankman-Fried.  
“We continue to work around-the-clock and we are far from done,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a prerecorded video message announcing the pleas Wednesday evening.  
Ellison, who was at times romantically linked to Bankman-Fried, pleaded guilty to seven counts that mirror a significant portion of Bankman-Fried’s indictment. Her charges include conspiracies to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. She faces up to 110 years in prison. Wang pleaded guilty to four conspiracy and fraud-related counts. He faces up to 50 years in prison.  
Williams, in his video message, encouraged other FTX insiders to come forward. “If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it,” he said. “We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal.”  
Bankman-Fried’s court appearance offered another compelling scene in a downfall that has unfolded even faster than his meteoric rise. Until months ago, he was one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the world, with an estimated $16 billion personal fortune. In the wake of FTX’s collapse, Bankman-Fried has said he is down to about $100,000 and one working credit card.  
The roughly $40 million he spent on political donations helped him forge ties to a key financial regulator and opened doors to committee chairmen and leaders on Capitol Hill. That money has since become an albatross for those who received it and now face questions about how they intend to pay it back.  
Bankman-Fried’s effort to pitch cryptocurrency as a mainstream tool for everyday investors to build wealth — a campaign backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing by FTX — has similarly boomeranged. The value of the global crypto market has shed roughly a quarter of its value, or about $250 billion, since the company imploded last month, according to data from CoinMarketCap. And its failure is continuing to reverberate through the crypto economy, with other companies that had exposure to FTX filing for bankruptcy or teetering.

Do you know how trades work? You don't have to trade exact salaries and can also use the salaries of guys like Damian Jones to get the salaries to work on all of the guys I mentioned.

Gafford is great, but the Wizards suck and I don't think anyone on that team is untouchable. 

Rudy Gay is a good shooter and decent defender still, but has been injured for most of the season. Also importantly he's large and plays the same position as Bron and AD who we have no depth for.

The Bulls suck and might blow up their team, so Patrick Williams could be available.

Thibs doesn't like Hartenstein. Doesn't play him much or use him correctly and Hartenstein is having a down year because of it. Could also be Reddish, but personally I don't think he's the game changer that most think he's going to be. 

Thad Young again offers much more than Nunn and plays a position the Lakers have no depth in. Raptors also have a million 6'9 players and no guards, so in theory Nunn could help them. Otto Porter also works but I didn't think the Raptors would trade their biggest free agent signing so quickly as a pr thing. 

Poetl is a long shot, I agree. But the contracts line up if you include Damian Jones.

Javale is a rim runner with length that offers more than Nunn, and Mavs currently giving the bench keys to Kemba so they need a guy like Nunn if he could return to form. 

Korkmaz isn't a highly likely guy, but the sixers could use Nunn if he could return to form with a change of scenery. He does some of the Maxey things in theory if he can return to form. I don't think he's untouchable, but definitely not likely. 

Pj has been mentioned before in trade talks, but he never really made sense to me as a guy the hornets wanted to get rid of. 

The Thunder are now in a situation where they've been bad for long enough that they have to pick and choose who to keep, who to pay. If the Lakers gave a first for both I think they would say yes.

Also why do any of these teams do these trades? They decide they're selling and the Lakers give them a draft pick or two.

Some of these trades could be a straight swap without draft picks. Some could be done for a 2nd or maybe 2 2nds. Some require a 1st. Most of these are eastern conference teams who aren't doing that well and could be sellers. These are the Laker's most likely teams they can trade with and these are the guys on those teams that I think help the Lakers the most.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1671473380.0,,False,0.0,{},j0vaoge,False,t3_zpttz7,False,t1_j0vaoge,True,t1_j0v587v,/r/lakers/comments/zpttz7/daily_lakers_trade_westbrook_sell_the_team_trade/j0vaoge/,1673077302.0,0.0,False,True,False,lakers,t5_2qhv6,r/lakers,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both of my favorite chapters from Volume 6.

Part 1: Loid tries to clear up Yor's misunderstandings about Fiona with a date at a bar. Which eventually evolves into mostly drunken nonsense thanks to Yor consuming more alcohol than she can tolerate, and Loid trying a honey trap on her and spectacularly failing at it! So they get kicked out of the bar.

But Yor is still troubled. To cheer her up, Loid tells her a story about his mother in the past. He states that Yor is strong, just like her, because Yor is giving Anya that same sense of security he used to have from his own mother, so that Anya can remain a cheerful, energetic child. Also, Yor has raised Yuri since their parents' deaths, so she has that experience to draw from (as opposed to Fiona). Thus, Loid has no intentions of replacing her whatsoever as Anya's mother and his wife. In the end, that pep talk boosts Yor's spirit. Thanks, Loid!

I was obviously excited about that disastrous drunk date like most Twiyor shippers, but I was looking forward to how the anime would adapt the bench scene more... And I'm happy to say that they nailed it! Yes! Especially that lullaby, it's so soothing... Saori Hayami has a lovely singing voice there.

Watching that scene with what is currently revealed in the later manga chapters makes it bittersweet for me, because in my opinion, that's not his Loid persona telling Yor about his mother anymore. That's his true self &gt;![redacted]!&lt; talking about his mother. &gt;!Mission 62 made it clear that he loved her and losing her in a bombing traumatized him.!&lt; Keep in mind that Loid has only known Yor (and Anya) for a few months, and yet he already feels comfortable enough around her to share this part of his past with her. In contrast, he has clearly known Franky for years due to his spy work &gt;!and they first met during the war!&lt;, and yet I doubt he even knows anything about this. It's proof that &gt;![redacted]!&lt; is slowly becoming Loid Forger, and &gt;![redacted]'s!&lt; background is slowly becoming Loid's background. Loid can think that being with his family has thrown him off-balance all he wants (that liar)... but I don't think that's a bad thing at all.

Part 2: Anya and Becky's shopping trip! It's a wholesome time of trying out clothes, shoes, and accessories, from start to finish. In the end, they may have forgotten Becky's original purpose for renting the entire department store, but they still had a blast anyway. The matching sheep keychains on their bags and their matching smiles are the icing on the cake, imo. Too adorable.

Reading this chapter endeared me to their friendship back then, and now, watching this part gave me that similar feeling too. It's just so sweet and pure.

Also, it's revealed from Martha's thoughts that in the past, Becky often clashed with other kids due to her blunt nature, and thought that she would encounter the same situation in Eden. Instead, she met Anya, who (partly) defended her on orientation day against Damian, and decided that school wouldn't be so bad after all because of her. So Becky declared that she would be Anya's friend, regardless of what everyone else in their class thought of her. Luckily, her blunt nature was exactly what Anya needed at that time for her to be less scared of school. Now, they are best friends, and they make each other happy, despite their differences.

Yeah, sorry for the essay there, I just loved both parts so much.

December 10, 2022 | Sunday Herald Sun: Web Edition Articles (Melbourne, Australia)
Author/Byline: Olivia Jenkins | Section: Education
659 Words

Violent student outbursts, their inability to sit still and a lack of respect for teachers make Australian classrooms some of the most disruptive in the world, education specialists say.

Researchers believe cultural differences between other nations and the high amount of freedom Australian students are given are other key reasons why Australia sits among the lowest international classroom behaviour rankings.

""Australia is a much more informal society, and the authority of the teacher is not automatic anymore,"" Australian Catholic University School of Education senior lecturer Jonathon Sargeant said.

""Kids experience a lot of autonomy outside of school and in most classrooms, and active participation is really welcomed, but sometimes it can get out of hand and challenges can occur in managing it.""

Dr Sargeant said even ""little events"" such as students talking back to teachers, losing items, leaving their seats or being distracted interrupted class time, with teachers often citing a lack of support to deal with these issues as a key factor in leaving the profession.

He said the disciplinary ranking of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which places Australia 70th out of 77 countries, making Aussies classrooms some of the most unruly in the world, was just one snapshot of classroom management.

But, he said, it highlighted how Australian students are given a lot of independence in class, mirroring the country's more laid back society compared to nations with high PISA outcomes such as Singapore or China where stricter teaching approaches were common.

The index ranks OECD countries by asking students to report how often distracting noises, other students' behaviour and students refusing to listen had interrupted lessons.

Unlike most other nations, students in Australian coeducational schools were less likely to be disciplined than students in single sex schools.

Head of Deakin University's School of Education Damian Blake said open learning spaces, which often involved collaboration across year levels and independent learning, meant teachers spent more time keeping students on track than teaching lesson content.

""The more a teacher has to address behaviour or a student's ability to regulate their behaviour, then that's time not spent on a task, not learning other things like literacy or mathematics,"" Prof Blake said.

Prof Blake said existing teachers now had to manage student behaviour more often following remote learning during the pandemic.

""Many kids have had two years where they haven't learned the sort of self regulation that a young person has when they're attending school face-to-face,"" he said.

One former teacher, who wished not to be named, said she felt forced to leave the sector altogether after working in secondary and specialist schools because she received little support in dealing with disengaged, and at times, physically violent students.

""I would be told the incidents were my fault, and things that happened in class while I was on my own were often downplayed,"" she said.

It comes as the Senate's Education and Employment References Committee has called for submissions for an inquiry that will probe disruption in school classrooms.

Liberal senator and Education and Employment References Committee chair Matt O'Sullivan pushed for the probe as the nation struggled with a teacher shortage.

He said it was crucial for teachers to share how they could be supported to manage students with diverse needs and behavioural challenges because it directly impacted their safety in the classroom and students' performance.

""Some workers in the education sector have had quite negative experiences in terms of the student violence that occurs,"" Mr O'Sullivan said.

""We want to make sure that we are providing kids and teachers with the best opportunity to educate and learn in a nurturing environment.""

The informality of Australian culture could be to blame for students’ disrespect and bad class behaviour, as “the authority of the teacher is not automatic anymore”.

Students in Australian coeducational schools are less likely to be disciplined than students in single sex schools.

However, I didn’t want to get too excited, so I had to temper my expectations. Lo and behold, though, we got a big chapter with lots of (figurative) bombshells dropped! I have a lot to talk about in return:

- I really like how the beginning was handled. With the police finally on the scene, you’d think you’re finally safe. However, Squire just reminded those kids that they’re still far from safe. Plus, there’s no way he’s gonna back down even when cornered.
- I was surprised to learn that the SSS was getting involved too. I thought they were just going to cover up all traces of the incident.
- Wow, forcing the kids to cover up the bus windows was really risky yet clever; especially considering the fact that the police already had snipers trained on the bus.
- I was so glad the other bus wasn’t forgotten. I was really worried it might’ve been the case since we didn’t see it for the past two chapters. 
- We finally get the full details of what Squire wants! He wants all 17 of his comrades released and escorted out of state. I get the feeling he and the Red Circus want to operate where the authority can’t get them. Nortica, hm? When was the last I heard that mentioned…?
- Just for fun, I did the math.  17 Red Circus members are incarcerated… Squire will release 5 kids for every Red Circus member, so we multiply 17 by 5. That results up to 85 kids. Wow, they took a lot!
- Seeing the SSS step into the scene too was really interesting in so many ways. The difference in philosophy and authority between them and the Berlint City Police was so intriguing. The BCP handles local affairs while the SSS handles national ones. The key difference is that the Secret Police doesn’t care if hostages are involved; all that matters is that all potential threats are suppressed and none of it gets out to the public.
- Even though the SSS seems to hold power over the local police, that power doesn’t look absolute considering the fact that the Ministry (of Foreign Affairs? Defense?) clearly specified to wait.
- I gasped when it was revealed that most of Squire’s comrades were dead. He’s definitely not going to take the truth very well.
- It was really clever of Squire to not give the police a deadline like Vadim suggested. He clearly knew what he was doing.
- Man, Damian’s so hard on himself. Trying to fulfill his role as the scion of the Desmond family only to be somewhat humiliated twice.
- And just like that, Bill continues to be my favorite side character. For a young kid, he’s so mature and reassuring! I think he’s the MVP of this arc. He’s done so much for everyone.
- Lulz, Damian called Bill a 40-year-old grade schooler. I mean, with that deep, manly voice of Bill’s, I can see where Damian was coming from.
- Meanwhile, WISE continues to work behind the scenes to rescue Anya. I was quite surprised they also took the other bus into account. I thought they’d focus on the one Anya’s on. However, it makes sense because forgetting about the other bus would raise questions; especially considering the fact that Eden Academy is the front line of this cold war. Anything that tarnishes Eden Academy’s image would endanger world peace.
- Hey, Kebab Guy’s back! We may not have seen him in-person, but it makes me happy to see that he’s helping out again.
- Pffft, Captain/First Lieutenant Scarface had to restrain Yuri to keep him from going out of his jurisdiction.
- It’s really interesting how Yuri has a lot of connections in the district the other bus was supposedly sighted in. I’m really glad for that because we finally get to see him get directly involved with the scene. On the other hand, I don’t think he knows which bus Chihuahua Girl’s on.
- I hesitate to talk about this, but Squire’s comment after that number one was really interesting. I don’t think Squire was aiming to humiliate any Eden Academy students, but he really must have something against the privileged.
- Huh, just when I thought Martha was going to get to the scene herself, Mr. Blackbell had to tag along. He must be REALLY worried about his daughter if not even Martha could stop him.
- Two surprises! Not was it revealed that Henderson and the Eden faculty arrived on the scene, but it was also revealed that he and Martha knew each other! How far back do they go??? I’m really curious about their history now.
- We’re at sundown now. Man, the kids really had it rough. Also, the tutor-in-residence is up again!
- Knowing what happened to most of the Red Circus members, I wonder if the chief was telling the truth about releasing three of them.
- I know Squire still needs the hostages for the negotiations, but it’s really interesting how he was willing to let the outsiders look after them to an extent.
- Wow, I already liked the Headmaster of Elegance enough, but seeing Henderson putting himself at risk to comfort his students made me respect him more and more; especially when he took the tutor’s place!
- Martha’s rhetorical question made me even more curious about her past with Henderson.
- Henderson’s reactions to Anya’s antics never cease to make me smile. It also made me so happy he remembered literally everything Anya mentioned in her interview. However, I doubt Anya actually remembers.
- I felt for Henderson when he assumed that he wasn’t needed after seeing how calm his students were. And again, Bill continues to be my favorite side character.
- Squire revealing that he had a daughter made me gasp. After learning this, I suspected that she was killed. I was even more shocked when I was right on the money.
- So Squire and his daughter were part of the Red Circus long before they became violent. According to him, it was the government’s fault for suppressing them when they were only standing up for the poor. However, when I think back to Twilight’s past and Chapter 63, I have a feeling we don’t have the full picture on what actually happened. Only two things remain certain in all this: 1) The Ostanian government really likes to rule over their people with an iron fist. 2) None of this excuses Squire’s actions.
- Meanwhile, Yuri found the other bus! It looks like the Red Circus members there are already moving onto the next phase. Also, I think I see one of the guys from the very beginning of the arc. I imagine that’s Bruce. With all that said, I really hope the kids there are okay…

Wow… I wasn’t expecting to like this arc so much. Lots of ups and downs (in a good way!), the Red Circus playing a bigger role, a sweet and funny DamiAnya moment, little hints of world-building, and overall tense atmosphere with some humor blended in really well. I also wondered back then if Squire really had it in him to hurt children, but after learning that he had a daughter, I can’t help but feel like he really doesn’t deep down. Even though his actions are unforgivable, I still can’t help but sympathize with him a bit, which is the last thing I expected to happen in this arc. However, I still feel like we don’t have the full picture on what happened back then, so I’ll reserve my judgement until we learn the whole story. For now, I’ll eagerly wait and see what happens next; especially after Yuri found the other bus.

Before I wrap up, let me share a little fun fact about Bill’s VA, Hiroki Yasumoto: One particular role of his that I’d like to highlight is Culverin Bear from Love After World Domination. [He sung the show’s opening theme for one episode](https://youtu.be/8Ov52qVNPBU) and, in my opinion, knocked it out of the park! I recommend that you listen to [the original version first](https://youtu.be/yNkMTniqjsU), though.

Oh, and one last thing before I forget. Let me share a song that came to mind while reading. This one’s for Squire’s revelation:

• SSS only has 1 goal and they don't care if innocent children are killed for it. Yuri gotta realise that the organisation he works for to keep the country his sister breathes in ( his words not mine ) safe would not give two shits if his sister's life was in danger and over a political emergency situation.

• It's sad that even in a life and death situation, Damian cares about how his father would react. 

• Billy Watkins, what a 40 year old grade schooler you are. Such words of wisdom at such a young age ? ELEEEEGAAAANTOOOOO !!!!

• I'm starting to have my doubts on WISE too. They did not give two shits when they first heard the news and only tried helping when they heard that Anya was in danger too.

• SSS knew that our obsessive siscon would take drastic measures all by himself if they did not let him help in the rescue. Thus, they tied him up. Poor Yuri. 

• Just after release, he already decided to scour the area of suspicion until he found the bus. Man's got serious determinations.

• The Red circus guy really reminded Emile to be thankful for his privileged life. Not everyone has that.

• Seeing Becky's dad really really loves her ! 💞

• Martha and Henderson know each other ? Now we want a extra chapter revolving around these two's pasts.

• Henderson is the most ELEEEEGAAAANTOOOOO Sensei you could ever find. That's a teacher who loves his students more than his life. Literally. 

• Anya being her dumb carefree self in life and death situations is always gonna be misinterpreted as having nerves of steel. "" WAHOO ! I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A HORSE ! "" seriously Anya ? 

• Becky thinks her dad would blow up the whole bus for her and Damian has to remind her that he would blow them up too. Meanwhile Anya still thinks her bestie has a WORLD DOMINATIONING family.

• The camaraderie formed between the students is really ELEEEEGAAAANTOOOOO. But no ELEGANTO- sensei, they really need your mental support.

• There is a reason why teachers can be called our second parents or grandparents. There are many shitty teachers but a lot of nice ones out there too. I keep in touch with my tutor who taught me until middle school and then moved away because of marriage. We kept in touch. She always gives me advice on situations and study tips even after all these years. Henderson this chapter really tells you that he is fond of his students. Education is always fun when the teacher teaching you is a nice person. It is the most ELEEEEGAAAANTOOOOO way of education.

• Alright so Red Circus Guy's daughter was killed for a peaceful movement created by students. This does not justify the sufferings he is inducing on innocent civilians and kids but definitely justifies his hatred towards the twisted system.

 ""My father was Superman, and now so am I,"" the series""

( Yeah, I'm Sorry, this is going to be a long bitter rant, Jon's Age Up is my supervillian origin. I haven't been able to truly enjoy dc's Superman comics since)

Jon will never be a nightwing for the Superman (that supergirl Kara's roles) because a nightwing requires decades of character development, natural growth not hitting the skip button twice and having the writers basically turned him into an adult off panel. 

Nothing done with Adult Jon feels real, he being Superman, the fight gainst doomsday in dark crisis, Whatever the f*** he doesn't his own solo series, him discovering and being bisexual (other major discovery that happened off panel and is the main thing he's known for now), His speeches that Tom Taylor likes Him to give despite (that he shouldn't be smart enough to have them because he never finished middle school) , It all doesn't feel real 

I hate Bendis's Superman changes stuff, 
Particularly, the madlib of ""he was on Earth 3 and up dimension being tortured"" Yeah, I totally didn't pull that out of my ass""  ( Which no matter who you ask everyone agrees was poorly done in not a good story) 
is now forever tied to Poor Jon or  that story was nonsensical but now we have to live with it, Most writers honestly skip over it because making that part of Jon's history would make him a lot crazier and damged than he should be. 
Jon's whole thing was that he was a normal person who happened to have superpowers like his dad, It's funnied since  basically that's what Tom Taylor turned Jon into, Clark, but younger. Gone is his original fun, passionate personality. Now he's just Clark but younger.

Making him Electric Blue is just more of DC's forced attempt to keep this stupid status quo going. At least, yeah, he'll be different and might have to actually learn how his powers work instead of just knowing how to be  Superman despite not having nearly as much experience. 

We already had a teenage superboy, his name was Connor Kent. Why didn't you just bring him back instead of ruining Jon,
Making Conner with a new Superman and having Jon be his kid sidekick would have a better story than anything SOKE
(Like when dick was Batman and Damian was robin) 

Also, what are the points of these new twins, we have Chris Kent and kid Jon for that role.

Kid Jon and supersons were amazing seeing (the movie, alone Was a good reminder of how perfect that status quo was) imagine that character go through all of this and having him get to meet the older members of Superman family ( Bendis just skipped over it because he really didn't care) would have been and fantastic.

Him being on the Teen Titans, him being a Super boy sidekicked to an Adult Connor kent who should have been the new Superman ( Instead of DC drawing Connor like hes 14 and Jon like he's s in his 20), Actually discovering his bisexuality instead of it just being done for marketing, and genuine history to call back on that would actually make him feel real instead of having to constantly add things to his back story because he no longer really has one. 

I can't enjoy adult Jon. Every single time I see him, I just want Super Boy Prime to show up
Discredit him with a beat down. Recton, punch him back into a 14 fun 🏳️‍🌈 kid version I can like. (Jay is irrelevant to me, keep him around or fridge him, for all I care either way works)

""Man, I thought I got screwed out of being superboy, you know. Oh, that's right, Tom Taylor isn't writing this, so you don't know stuff you shouldn't. Did Connor tell you who I am? Oh, that's right.

[],False,,nearly_headless_nic,1564152918.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_48khfrhf,False,False,"**Full Q&amp;A Transcript:**

**Damian, UK: How is life in Manchester and how do you feel you have settled into the club?**

“Well everything is going really really well. I’m very happy and my family is also very happy too. I have nothing but thanks for everyone here at the club. Every member of staff here at the club is helping me a lot. The players, the coaching staff, and I’m genuinely so grateful, first and foremost, that everyone is so nice and friendly, and I believe with any doubt, that’s very important for me because everyone, without exception, is offering me a huge helping hand.”

**Jorgen, Norway: What made you decide to move to United?**

**“Without a doubt it was down to the great stature of Manchester, because it’s a massive club with a great history. For sure that was the big attraction for coming here. I think that the great standing this club has in the game and its great history are definitely the most important reasons to be here.** It’s also a fresh set of goals in a brand new league for me. So that presents a really big and exciting challenge for me and I’m working really hard to achieve them alongside my teammates.”

**Ayaz, France: Why did you choose to wear the no.18 shirt?**

“I believe there were one or two different numbers available, and the number that I liked the most was the 18. So that was one of the reasons for me to choose that one.”

**Seth, UK: What was going on inside your mind when you scored your goal against Chelsea?**

“It was a really euphoric moment for me! More than anything down to the situation in the game at the time. We’d been playing really well and were pretty much in control of the game. But then we conceded, and then in the 91st or 92nd minute, I can’t recall just now, I scored that goal, and the ball only just went over the line, and so to be honest I didn’t quite know how to celebrate it. So I was so elated I celebrated the goal with all my heart. I didn’t realise too much what I was doing because it was a goal that came from the heart. It was a fantastic goal for us and so I didn’t really know what to do to celebrate it, the only thing I wanted to do was to celebrate the moment with my team-mates and the fans, because it was very important for us in a game where we’d played very well.”

**Ti, France: How do you find the atmosphere in the stadiums here in England, is it different to Spain?**

“Both places have their good points of course. But one of the things that has surprised me the most over here has been the supporters. The passion that they have for the game and how they really live for their football. When the weekend comes around, how the fans just live off their football. How the fans just exude football, and you can see that football is their passion and that football is their life. So it’s not just here at Old Trafford for the home games, but away from home to, wow, the fans are just incredible. The supporters, the atmosphere, the way the fans get behind us, just fantastic, and one of the things that has surprised me the most since coming to England. But you cannot want for anything more from our fans, and what’s more, you have to thank them for the way the support us and I have never seen anything like that before.”

**Daniel, UK: What is the best moment of your career so far?**

“I’m one of those players who think about the here and now. I’m a player who enjoys the moment. So, my moment right now is here at United. My moment is right now, playing one match at a time and winning one match at a time. And then as a result, that’s how trophies come along, by playing well and winning matches. I’m a person who lives for the now and tries to enjoy the moment. So, my best moment is always right now and I’m enjoying it tremendously. Not just me but along with my family as well, I’m very happy and clearly for me it’s a real honour to be here.”

**Derek, Malta: Which was your favourite team growing up?**

“I didn’t really have one. I always liked Sao Paulo from when I started out playing for them, so they became my team since that’s where I began playing as a kid and in the end, I spent a long time with Sao Paulo as a youngster, so that club grew really close to my heart. But now, as everyone knows, as professional footballers, wherever you play becomes your life and your passion and so I don’t think I really have another favourite club now.”

**Patrick, Ghana: What do you want to achieve at United before you leave?**

“Well at the end of the day, when you go to a club you always want to pick up as many victories and trophies as you possibly can but I’m the kind of person who takes things match by match. I think the key right now is to have a strong and solid team that can compete. Of course, you’re always aiming at winning trophies, but I believe that we have to think about each game as it comes, we’re on a good run of and we’re growing and improving with each game that we play. So that’s how we should be thinking really, I’m not one for looking too far ahead. I prefer to enjoy the present. So I just focus on the next game and of course as a result in the end we all want to win silverware, but I’m the type of player who wants to keep on amassing win after win after win.”

**Randall, US: Which food do you miss the most from Brazil?**

“No dish in particular as I have everything here with me!”

**Cian, UK: Which is your favourite music to listen to?**

“I like listening to all kinds of music, but I guess after being in Spain for so long, I tend to prefer Spanish music, like reggaeton. So yeah, I like Spanish music the most.”

**Jamie, Ireland: Which footballers did you idolise growing up?**

“Good question! I think when you’re a kid you have a lot of idols don’t you. You have players that you’d never have imagined going on to meet one day. But now it’s my turn, in the sense that lots of youngsters are inspired by United players. But honestly, I used to love watching Zidane. I loved watching Scholes too, and talking of United, Scholes, Rio Ferdinand, what an incredible player! These are all players who were winners. Ronaldo Fenomeno, Ronaldinho Gaucho... And talking of players in my position, Gilberto Silva, Mauro Silva, Makelele… When you’re a kid you have lots of idols and heroes, lots of players that you like and lots of players who inspire you. So maybe not everyone remembers all of them, but for me, they were just the top players in the world!”

**Archie, UK: What is your favourite goal you have scored from your career so far?**

“My favourite one has to be the one that I scored against Napoli in the Champions League, but the most important one was in the Champions League Final against Juventus.”

**Furba, Nepal: How is your English coming along? Do you know any words or phrases yet?**

“It’s coming along slowly, little by little! English is really difficult, not easy at all! But the club is helping me with it a lot and so are my team-mates, but English… it’s just so complicated! But I’m on it, and I’m studying hard!”

**Mahir, UK: What would you say is your greatest attribute as a footballer?**

“The passion that I feel for the game.”

**Andrew, Nigeria: Which sports do you enjoy other than football?**

“Well I like playing electronic games, I like basketball and I love watching basketball games. I think those two things really…”

**Frederick, UK: If you weren’t a professional footballer, what job would you have?**

“I believe that since I love the game so much, I’d be working in the world of football. In any event, I’m fortunate enough to be where I am here at Manchester United, but I’d certainly like to be working in football in some capacity, it wouldn’t matter what. Maybe in… it really doesn’t matter. I’d just like to be in the world of football because I think football is in my blood and it’s my real passion.”

**Lucas, Taiwan: What’s your favourite television series or movie?**

“I’m not really one for watching a lot of that kind of stuff. I really like watching documentaries. I like to watch real-life stories, films based on true historical events that have actually happened.

[],False,,ShatteredMasque,1618400075.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_bj6oay37,False,False,"Movie 1:

* Damian (using another name than Wayne or Ghul) approaches Bruce for an interview. He's a university student who is investigating the historicity of the relation between cult-like behavior, organized crime and politics in Gotham by analyzing the surviving oral histories of the founding families of the city. During the interview Damian raises suspicion by using jargon that Bruce recognizes from the League of Shadows.
* Weeks later they meet again at a drug bust. Batman violently intervenes with a shipment of raw opium that Joker and Scarecrow's entourage came to collect. Damian gets injured. Not knowing whether Damian is involved or an innocent bystander, Batman takes him in for questioning. Before Damian comes to it is revealed through DNA testing that Damian is a Wayne, likely Bruce's son. The first thing Damian does as he regains consciousness is calling out Batman's hypocrisy. He could've made sure that the opium was used for good, but by leaving it to the authorities to deal with he is just playing to the League's hand. There's talk around town about Batman being like Robin Hood, but according to Damian he's no better than any other devil. Upon the question how they are related all Damian says: ""I was orphaned and you killed my mother.""
* Not knowing what to do with Damian - as he could easily expose the Batman operation - Alfred and Bruce keep Damian contained to the manor. Through Damian's notes Bruce learns that the League has been trafficking drugs to influence global politics since its inception. Further research indicates that this particular shipment is connected to a secretive project between Arkham and the US Department of Defense called 'Lazarus'. Utilizing Kryptonian tech and various substances they mean to develop a treatment that could reconfigure the mind. Theoretically it could cure mental illness, but also to acquire various military and espionage assets by way of brainwashing.
* Bruce arranges a meeting with Arkham's lead on the project: Hugo Strange. Who states that he is uncomfortable discussing the project with Bruce, since the largest non-governmental financial contributor is an NGO led by Thalia Al-Ghul. Eventually Thalia and Bruce meet. She claims to have left Bruce because she was secretly pregnant and did not want to raise a child with the burden of the League and Batman looming over them. Unfortunately the League found her as she was in labor and the child was stillborn. She has been forced to work for the League's public operations ever since.
* Bruce does not tell Thalia about Damian, but he does show Damian proof that his mother is still alive. Damian's attitude towards Bruce improves and he is allowed to leave the manor again. Damian meets with Strange for advice on his thesis, but Strange drugs him. He had deduced that Damian must somehow be related to Thalia and Bruce. He holds Damian hostage in order to get Thalia to give him free reign over Lazarus.
* Thalia seemingly plays along, but warns Bruce. Together they hatch a plan to rescue Damian, but since Strange also figured out the identity of Batman he already had Joker and Scarecrow waiting on them. Thalia manages to free Damian who flees to the manor. Joker and Scarecrow use their toxin and gas on Batman - who subsequently kills Thalia in his confusion.
* Joker and Scarecrow escape as the League raid Arkham to remove or destroy any trace of Lazarus. They inoculate Batman with an antidote and leave him unconscious at the gates of Wayne manor.

Movie 2:

* Several years later, Damian has moved into Wayne manor. He is working on his anthropology phd while Bruce contemplates giving up the Batmantle in lieu for a stint as mayor. Bruce doesn't get along with Damian's girlfriend Pamela Isley. He is impressed by her for being an up-and-coming biochemist, but is troubled by her recreational drug use. Joker and Scarecrow's chemical substances have shown up diluted and cut in Gotham's recreational drugs as of late. Gordon had kindly asked Batman to stand down from the case, as Gordon had the impression Batman had an emotional investment in it.
* Harvey Dent runs a campaign for DA on a ticket urging for health care for addicts in stead of conviction. The largest contributor to his campaign is Hugo Strange. With whom Dent tries to cut all ties as soon as he realizes Strange's connection to organized crime. Strange tries to persuade him using a formula derived from the Lazarus project, but it won't even take with additional doses. Strange concludes that that must be because Dent is of sound mind, so he decides to torture him. Out of the ordeal Two-Face emerges, whom kills Strange.
* Pamela is offered a lucrative research position with a joint-venture between the US Department of Health and Wayne Enterprises' cosmetics division. She would be working to develop cosmetics infused with pheromones that would aid the wearer's mental health. Damian finds it eerily close to project Lazarus, so investigates. He finds out that she is to work with a botanist who is specialized in plants from the ancestral lands of the League of Shadows. This raises alarm bells. He tries to convince Pamela to use her expertise to raise awareness in stead of developing dangerous commodities, but tensions run high and they break up.
* After being missing for weeks, Dent shows up at Wayne manor unannounced to ask Bruce for advice on how to continue his campaign with his new visage. Bruce offers a blank check for Dent to hire consultants, but Dent uses it otherwise. He hires dozens of mercenaries to dress up like Batman and eliminate the local crime bosses. In his new campaign Dent focuses on Batman as the cause of the city's strife with crime. As journalists keep focusing on Dent's new appearance, he becomes increasingly unhinged.
* Damian informs Bruce about the situation with Pamela. Bruce inquires with Wayne Enterprises about the project and comes to the same conclusions as Damian: the League might be involved. After some string-pulling Bruce manages to get the botanist fired and to re-focus the project on developing treatment for burn victims. Secretly Pamela keeps working on what she had intended to work on with the botanist anyway, but as a side-project.
* Dents gets wind of this re-focus at Wayne Enterprises. He is offended for two reasons: first, the original project could've helped addicts; second, he assumes the project was re-focused because of what happened to his face. Dent loses it and starts making public claims of Bruce being Batman. This effectively puts a bounty on Bruce's head. Which is a threat that doesn't come to a head until an assassination attempt is thwarted by Damian in a Batman costume. In a moment of clarity Dent shoots himself in the head.

Movie 3:

* A year or two later Bruce loses the mayoral election after his opponent launched a smear campaign over how people around Bruce often end up missing or dead. Meanwhile Damian thinks that with his phd research he might have uncovered a local rival to the League of Shadows: the Court of Owls. Pamela has been getting back in touch with Damian and laments the way that they broke up.
* The new mayor turns out to be a member of the Court of Owls.
* Pamela is revealed to work for the League of Assassins under the name Poison Ivy.
* Clayface - a product of experiments by the company's cosmetics division - has from the inside staged a hostile takeover of Wayne Enterprises by replacing a handful of key figures. Even killing and replacing Alfred in an attempt to kill Bruce.
* The situation pushes Damian to take vigilante action, but he does not want to be Batman or Robin. In stead he adopts the name Nightwing. Bruce becomes his mentor and man-in-the-chair.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1669565831.0,,False,0.0,{},ixzef3b,False,t3_z5nal1,False,t1_ixzef3b,True,t3_z5nal1,/r/batman/comments/z5nal1/if_you_were_to_make_a_trilogy_of_flims_around/ixzef3b/,1671070729.0,1.0,False,True,False,batman,t5_2qqt8,r/batman,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every level will take a slightly larger chunk of whatever income you're able to scrounge up, so there will be a point where you just give up on it because continuing doesn't make sense. The more better all your stuff is the longer it takes to reach that point. Typically when the elevator and warehouse reach the 1300-1400 range you'll start to feel the crunch and from there on it becomes a steadily tightening exercise in increasing your pain threshold, or at least about increasing your patience to zen levels. You can get a feel for this every week in the event mine too, that's the range when it becomes much slower to keep upgrading anything other than the shafts.

Getting strong shaft ahead SMs is the key to grinding through the middle part of continent mines. Ezio is the best, Lorenzo is the 2nd best, 3rd and 4th are probably Agatha or Henry in either order, then you have Green Idler, Turner, Blingsley, and finally Steiner. Getting rare SMs like Turner, Sue, Damian Jones, and Zi promoted at level 30 unlocks their mine income factor -passive which just overall buffs every number you see in the mine. Goodman Jr is naturally one of the most important parts of this strategy, just gather up all the moneys with these SMs and then dump them back into the bottom-most shaft with Jr and that's shaft ahead in a nut shell. Preferably all of these should be high ranked too, but for the first two continents it doesn't matter that much.

Things looked really touch and go there at times, but I think I am happy to get out of here today for a chance to go positive with SD still pending. Penn State nearly blew it, but fortunately had built up enough of a lead to hold on for the cover. Towson roared back with a fantastic 2H, Richmond couldn't quite get over the hump, while Matt Grace is not Grant Golden he is such a vital part of their offense this season and think we saw that tonight in his absence. Merrimack had a late scratch of Jordan Minor, which really torpedoed that pick unfortunately. VCU battled back and beat the trap line, which we sorely needed and South Dakota well they did not have it tonight, I was flat-out wrong there. Great slate tomorrow, probably will not have time to write unfortunately as I am driving back home tomorrow and enjoying a weekend with friends/family before I start my in-class practicum on Monday. Expect a few picks to come in the morning/afternoon. While I may not be able to write my usual paragraphs, please feel free to ask questions I will answer them all as I can! BOL as always and have a fantastic weekend, spend it having some fun!

Picks: 

Georgetown -2.5: The Hoyas had a disappointing effort earlier this week against Northwestern, but I think their usual dosage of one really strong half could be enough against LMU. This is a significantly weaker Lions team as they are predicted to finish 9th in the WCC and personally I think they lost far too much from last year's team. Joe Quintana and Eli Scott have moved on. Additionally, LMU will be without Demeane Douglas (injured) and while they brought in Justin Ahrens (Ohio State) and Michael Graham (Elon), the Lions just cannot replicate last year's production. The Hoyas on the other hand rebuilt their entire roster really and managed to put together quite a bit of talent. Jay Heath looked awesome in his first game as a Hoya, Heath had 13 points and 2 assists, which helped keep the Hoyas in the game as Brandon Murray struggled. Murray went 1 for 10 from the floor and only scored 5 points, while he can be streaky I do not expect this low of production from Murray on a consistent basis. Additionally, Primo Spears is playing extremely downhill right now and opening up a lot of stuff for Georgetown's perimeter players. I think the key match-up that Georgetown needs to expose in this game though is LMU's undersized frontcourt, Qudus Wahab has to own the paint on offense and try to use length to dominate on the block. Keli Leaupepe is a demon for LMU, but he's also only 6'6 and while he's strong as a tank I think his lack of length could hurt LMU against Wahab or even Akok Akok. Georgetown gets off to a nice start in Jamaica.

UCLA -3.5: UCLA under the lights in Vegas will look to put everyone on notice. The losses of Juzang, Bernard and Riley hurt, but look Tyger Campbell and Jamie Jaquez is a fantastic duo to lead the Bruins. Jaylen Clark and David Singleton have taken large steps forward and made it easy to insert Amari Bailey and Adem Bona into this lineup. Illinois have a very exciting team, but they are young and lack the chemistry/system that UCLA has developed. I expect Mick Cronin to masterfully navigate this game and as a short favourite, I think UCLA can cover this game by limiting their mistakes and attacking mismatches.

Rutgers -4.5: Cliff Omoruyi has been on another level to start this season and no one on Temple can match him. Jamille Reynolds cannot defend him and Zach Hicks has struggled so much offensively to start this season, these Owls do not realize what's coming. Cliff is scoring 16.3PPG and grabbing 10.3RPG, he has made it easy on newcomers Cam Spencer and Derek Simpson who have given Rutgers instant production. Aundre Hyatt has taken a large step forward for the Knights.This is a long lineup with 6'3 being their shortest starter and Steve Pikkell puts such a large emphasis on intense defense, that I believe Temple will be overwhelmed by the Knights. Spencer will be tasked with responsibility of guarding Damian Dunn who is really the engine that makes Temple go, this will be the best defense Dunn has faced all season and while he is on a heater, I am confident Rutgers will have a gameplan to throw him off his game. Mulcahy and McConnell may be missing, but the Knights have done fine with Caleb thus far and I am confident that Pikes will have the guys really hyped up for this game, Paul and Caleb are the heartbeat of this team, the lowerclassmen and Cliff will want to step up for their brothers.

Xavier +1.5: Now let me preface that I think IU is going to have an awesome season, but this is Sean Miller's spot to announce that he is fully back. Jack Nunge is one of the most underrated players in the country. He grew so much as a player last season and looks even better this season, I feel a big part of this Zach Freemantle flanking him. Freemantle and Nunge make such a lethal frontcourt and with Freemantle's play-making abilities and Nunge's floor-spacing, the X can tear defenses apart. Souley Boum has seamlessly fit into this offense, the UTEP transfer was a huge get for Xavier this off-season. Adam Kunkel looked awesome filling in for Colby Jones scoring 21 points and the working theory is that Colby could be back for this big tilt. The trio of Trayce, Xavier Johnson and Race Thompson are back to lead the Hoosiers and IU brought in some awesome freshmen, but the Hoosiers will need time to get better outside of Assembly Hall. Indiana struggled so badly on the road, they have went 7-13-1 ATS as the away team over the past two seasons and I see this continuing here.

Central Arkansas +3.5

Boise State ML +105: Now neither Boise nor Loyola-Chicago have looked impressive, but this line just feels wrong. Boise just could not get the ball to go down on Thursday and only scored 11 first half points, they still only allowed 54 points. They are going to expose LUC's horrible ball-handling and force turnovers, the transition offense will allow Boise's athleticism to shine and will help them get their feet underneath them. This is a classic get right game and I am going to trust Boise's veterans here, they have played a far more difficult schedule and are going to want to send a strong response, whereas LUC look like a project after getting obliterated by Tulsa last night.

a category shift, or, failing that, a long-overdue widening of cricket's statistical
net. We hear and read so much nowadays about strike rates and dot balls, the
keys to cricket's white-ball kingdom, but how about something more down-
home?

Anyone fancy designing an equation or algorithm about Big Players? Players
who command both the opposition and their nerves, as Stokes did at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) with such apparent ease a couple of days
ago.

So, then, big players. How about a list? By their very nature lists are provisional
and idiosyncratic, so let's begin with one from the long boundary of whimsy:
Aravinda De Silva. In the 1996 World Cup final in Lahore, De Silva, batting at
four for Sri Lanka, came in with the score at 23 for two, the Lankans chasing Australia's 241 for seven.
Wearing what looked suspiciously like his older brother's blue shirt, the tiny De
Silva batted with a plan. First, he took guard on middle-and-leg, the tip of his
left foot marginally more leg-side than the tip of his right; this opened up his
stance ever so slightly, allowing him to work right-arm over-the-wicket bowlers
(Australia had three: Glenn McGrath, Damian Fleming and Paul Reiffel)
through the leg side from middle-and-off.

Watching the video of his innings it's interesting to see how he'd pared-down
his technique to working essentials: no flourishing back-lift, no forward press,
no fuss, the perfect unity of form and function. Just a still head and a straight
blade, a blade that somehow seemed to get wider and wider and wider.

Sri Lanka were narrowly behind the scoring rate throughout their chase but the
chemistry of the contest changed in Shane Warne's last over, which went for 13,
including Warnie fluffing a possible caught and bowled from Sri Lankan
skipper, Arjuna Ranatunga.
After the damming up, so the flood. De Silva went to his hundred shortly after
the big Warne over and Sri Lanka eventually won with nearly four overs to spare
- so much for being behind the rate.

Warne's performance at the Gaddafi Stadium wasn't his finest hour. He batted
at five for a five-ball two (stumped Kaluwitharana bowled Muttiah
Muralitharan) and recorded figures of 10-0-58-0 as the sunshine yellow in the
Aussies' shirts sunk with their hopes.
But Warne was too prideful a player to be deterred by the occasional off day. A
thespian forever in search of the big occasion, by the time the 1999 World Cup
wound round, he found it in the tied semi-final at Edgbaston against South
Africa.

South Africa restricted Australia to 213 (Michael Bevan 65, Steve Waugh 56;
Shaun Pollock five for 36) and were well on their way to their target on 48
without loss in 12 overs when Waugh threw the ball to Warne.

Up stepped Mr. Big, hitting the top of Herschelle Gibbs' (30) off-stump with
such a ripper that Gibbs was reluctant to accept the evidence before his eyes.
Off the first ball of his following over, Warne bowled into the footmarks outside
a sweeping Gary Kirsten's off-stump; the ball gripped and spun wickedly and
suddenly Kirsten (18) was on his bike.

Two balls later, Hansie Cronje, the South African skipper, mistimed a flick to leg
off a fully-flighted delivery, and was caught at first slip off what appeared to be
his boot. ""It sums up what Warne can do to you emotionally,"" said Adam
Gilchrist.

Warne had bowled the ""ball of the century"" to Mike Gatting six years before but
Gilly's quip unwittingly reached for an immortality of its own. Under-statement
of the century, anyone?
Warne returned to account for Jacques Kallis (53) to record figures of 10-4-29-4
as South Africa tied the game thanks to that run-out between Lance Klusener
and Allan Donald, failing to reach the final by virtue of losing to Australia in
their previous Super Six match.

So, there we have it, contrasting sides to the same Big Player theory: De Silva, a
big player once only, a situation confirmed by his stats (308 ODI's, 11 hundreds
at an average of 34.9), with Warne the serial Big Achiever - the big player with
the big big-player habit.
The stats, of course, leave out the emotional colour of big moments, the haze of
feeling and emotion that lead to great performance. De Silva witnessed first-
hand the calling of Murali for chucking during the Sri Lanka tour of Australia
six months prior to the Lahore final. The Sri Lankans nursed a strong sense of
hurt as a result of it, one sharpened by the decision of the Australians and the
West Indies not to play in Sri Lanka in the World Cup preliminaries.

There was backstory to Warne's big Edgbaston achievement too. Matters
between him as vice-captain and Steve Waugh, his skipper, were strained. There
were even murmurings behind-the-scenes that he and others might be playing
their last game for Australia.
Warne and Waugh were even on different sides in the recreational ten-pin
bowling jaunts the team undertook between matches: Warne was a ""Julio"", one
of the cool set, while Waugh - perhaps predictably - was a ""Nerd.""

So to Stokes, bowler of that over to Carlos Brathwaite in the T20 final at Eden Gardens. Brathwaite provides the tabloid backstory to Stokes' achievement on
Sunday - the West Indies needed 19 in the final over in the final six years ago,
remember - but more impressive, surely, was Stokes' big-match composure
against Pakistan after his match-winning knock at Lord's against New Zealand
in the 2019 CWC final.


Despite a couple of early Jos Buttler cover-drives against Pakistan, England
never looked entirely comfortable chasing Pakistan's 137 for eight on the
weekend. Alex Hales played on, Phil Salt pulled a very quick delivery from Haris
Rauf meekly to Iftikhar Ahmed and Buttler wafted an outside edge to
Mohammad Rizwan to make it 45 for three.

The overs directly after Buttler's dismissal for 26 provided the stage for the big
battle of the T20 war. Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Wasim were
all bowling with big gas and Stokes looked all at sea.
He played and missed; for half an over he couldn't actually lay bat on ball. But
he wasn't perturbed; he grinned, he smiled. You fancy he said something mildly
self-deprecating to one of the Pakistan bowlers. All the while he was calm. He
didn't look ruffled, even as Harry Brook did. England's score slowly mounted.
Stokes bade his sweet time.

The turning point of the battle was Brook's dismissal, as he lofted a drive to
Shaheen at long-off off Shadab Khan. Shaheen injured his knee in taking the
catch and although he returned later, he could only bowl one ball. Iftikhar
completed the over which Stokes took for 13, including a four and a six. The break-out over had arrived - and not an over too soon.

Sensing the turning tide, new batsman, Moeen Ali, grabbed a piece of the action
in the following over, scoring consecutive fours off Mohammad Wasim, a Harry
Houdini moment as England wriggled free of the scoring rate. Stokes was the
big man but Ali gambled on freeing the shackles for once and for all. Big players
need self-sacrificing players more than they know.
So, then, what of calm, grace under pressure, poise, the temperamental bedrock
difficult to quantify so alien to statistics? Stokes had never before scored a T20
fifty but now he chose the biggest moment on the biggest stage to score his
first.

Big players loom over their stats (Stokes has a strike rate of 128 and an average of
21.66 in T20 internationals) and dwarf them into irrelevance. Come the big
moments and the defining battles and the giants of the world game simply go
their own way.

De Silva, Warne, Stokes - who are the other big players of our time? Mahendra
Singh Dhoni, surely, makes the list for his match-winning 91 off 79 balls against
Sri Lanka in the 2011 World Cup final at the Wankhede. Ricky Ponting -
remember his hundred in the 2003 World Cup final against India at the
Wanderers? - was undoubtedly a big player for the big stage, as were Freddie
Flintoff and Lance Klusener.

The list, though, has glaring omissions, one of which is Marlon Samuels, the
Jamaican who likes not to be liked. Samuels has a legitimate claim. His 78 in the
final of the 2012 World T20 against Sri Lanka came out of a collective Windies
total of 138 for seven (next highest score? Darren Sammy's 26 not out), while his
contribution to the 2016 World Twenty20 was even more impressive.

Fans remember Brathwaite's assault on Stokes - and rightly so - but Samuels, to
use a deliberately old-fashioned phrase, laid the platform with 85 not out in 66
balls. Samuels has a big claim to being a proper big player - which perhaps
accounts for why he clashed so frequently down through the years with Warne
and Stokes, both egos of note.
And what of our formula? Surely a way could be found to give preferential
weighting to spells of bowling or innings' that occur in situations of increasing
difficulty as tournaments move towards finals? This, surely, is the final arena of
greatness - and a way should be found to measure it. Perhaps this is why we still
need words, for figures only tell a hollow fraction of the big story.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1668687979.0,,False,0.0,{},iwpnf1s,True,t3_yxow7h,False,t1_iwpnf1s,False,t3_yxow7h,/r/Cricket/comments/yxow7h/the_giants_that_dwarf_the_statistics/iwpnf1s/,1671115024.0,19.0,False,True,False,Cricket,t5_2qhe0,r/Cricket,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,,paxusromanus811,1587478853.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_69pgpbij,False,True,"What I learned from one of the better losses of the season

Jacob really should be looking to score a bit more this year. He has really nice touch and is much quicker than he's given credit for. I liked San Antonio looking to him to take advantage and I hope they continue to do that throughout the year. He was tremendous on both ends particularly on offense where when he wasn't scoring he was keeping the ball moving with his passing all night 

Johnson is the heart and soul of this team. But when he's not scoring at a high level he can sometimes be a bit of a liability at this point early in the season. He's probably the weakest defender in the starting lineup and if he's asked to do more than basic passes on the move as a playmaker it usually doesn't end well. Most damning for him is a good percentage of his turnovers come down to simple mistakes like traveling moving before he catches the ball, passing to a spot where he assumes a teammate is going to be without looking first etc etc. I'm sure he'll get better but tonight was hard to watch outside his shooting and driving

Devin had a bit of a similar game though he was most certainly better defensively then Johnson. Both him and Johnson were guilty for a Solid 5 turnovers from Simply passing the ball into the third row because they didn't check to confirm a teammate was actually moving to the place they thought they would be. Like Johnson a lot of his turnovers are of the careless variety. I wish he was a bit more aggressive offensively particularly when he's playing with the second unit and the offense starts to stagnate. He hasn't been consistent with his Killer Instinct and go to mentality and tonight that definitely heard a bit when San Antonio got bogged down and he deferred instead of looking to call his own number. He did have some really good burst of shop making though and this was one of his better defensive games of the season

Trey Jones had a very typical Trey Jones game, in a good way, and that he was steady on offense and made the right decisions with the ball. On defense his hustle is extraordinary. I wish there was literally a catch-all hustle stat to measure things like tipped balls recovered loose balls deflected passes that could all come together in some kind of score because Jones would be at the top of the league for sure. He also was noticeably targeted by Portland defensively and they were consistently looking to get him on ball handlers which is become and unfortunate Trend this year and something Jones is going to have to rise to the challenge with. It was nice to have him back we look much better when he's playing well

His stats aren't going to scream and jump off the page but this was one of the top two or three performances of the season for Jeremy sohan. It's amazing how much better a 19-year-old 6 ft 8 front Court player being asked to be a lead ball handler for the first time, can look when he's being defended by Damian Lillard and Jeremy Grant instead of Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green. I thought he did an excellent job of running the offense without trying to do too much and forcing the issue. But unlike last game he wasn't nearly as passive and when the opportunities arose found his way into the paint and got the ball where it needed to go. It was incredibly telling that Greg Popovich used his rotations, and his play challenge, in a manner that made it very clear he thought Jeremy was the key ingredient for this game. They were absolutely desperate to make sure he was out there as consistently and frequently as Damian Lillard was. And I thought he did a much better job than anyone in his position had any right to. Like wow was he good on defense this game.

Richardson was.. unfortunately very similar to the Richardson of recent form which is bad. Quite bad. I thought defensively he was actually pretty solid but offensively he's just a train wreck right now. You can tell he's lost confidence in his ball handling because he won't even really try to do much off the dribble or initiate anything beyond simple handoffs are basic 15 ft passes. If that kind of action isn't available he's immediately settling for contested 18 to 23 footers. Earlier in the year he was hitting those but they've started to dry up a bit. It's a shame Blake Wesley and Malachi Branham aren't healthy/ a bit more seasoned because sending Jay Rich off for any draft collateral possible and giving the young guys some time wouldn't be a terrible idea at this point. I like him a ton and he seems like a great guy but he doesn't really fit with that bench unit right now. He needs a true point guard and we just don't have someone to allow him to play his proper role

I thought Doug McDermott hustled really hard on defense and was okay enough on offense. I'd like San Antonio to try to get him a couple of games in the next week or so or he can get up a good solid 10 to 12 three pointers and just let him empty the clip. He seems to be in a little bit of a mini slump in regards to not just hitting threes but being able to get them off. Teams are all over him when he comes off the bench and San Antonio freeing him up a bit more would go a long way towards getting their offense back to the kind of levels it will need to be at to carry this terrible defense

Kbd is without a doubt one of the most frustrating Spurs I've ever had to watch for long periods of time. He goes back and forth between just moments of individual Brilliance and intelligent play, and some of the most boneheaded basketball I've seen. The guys just a Exquisite finisher and very solid in the passing lanes. But he really struggled in one-on-one situations on D in this game, and he missed a few rotations that let Jeremy Grant absolutely get wide open looks. The epitome of the kind of stuff he does sometimes that drives me crazy was in the fourth quarter. The big Austrian who was on fire had just checked back in and kbd caught the ball on the wing with Lillard on him. Jacob put a hand up and cold for the past and instead kbd waved him off and proceeded to try to post up Lillard only to put up an extremely low and poor push shot attempt that somehow got blocked by the 6-foot to, if we're being generous, Damian Lillard. It was a momentum deflating play and there was no reason for him to try to do that. I'm all for exploiting mismatches but there was plenty of time on the clock and there were significantly better options available that should have been a plan C or D


Charles Bassey had a few moments but for the most part the Blazers were ready for him this game. Every time a shot went up there were two Blazers boxing him out trying to keep him off the glass and they did a pretty solid job. Bassey still managed a couple of really impressive blocks but he also showed his inexperience with a couple of really poor decisions such as causing a goal tending in a situation that was absolutely just not needed or excusable. Probably his toughest game as a Spur but even then he still made an impact in a few moments. I really think San Antonio should start letting him, and pushing him too, put up a few threes. Even if he doesn't hit them it'll really help a lot if he can spread the floor

All in all this was a solid game. Our lottery pick is just simply an incredible player for his age and getting better every game. Both are young stars have so much room to improve and are already borderline Elite shotmakers. These are exactly the type of losses you hope to see if the season does indeed continue to Trend that direction.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1668577725.0,,False,0.0,{},iwk5s8y,False,t3_ywkttd,False,t1_iwk5s8y,False,t3_ywkttd,/r/NBASpurs/comments/ywkttd/post_game_thread_the_portland_trail_blazers/iwk5s8y/,1671120486.0,16.0,False,True,False,NBASpurs,t5_2s53b,r/NBASpurs,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; **Updated: November 15, 2022 11:58 AM GMT**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A top government official in Kyrgyzstan has termed the construction of the first Catholic cathedral in the country as a sign of the Muslim-majority nation’s commitment to democratic values and religious freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; “Our Republic adheres to democratic principles and that of the freedom to profess one's faith. The construction of the cathedral church is proof of this,” said Valerij Dil, advisor to Kyrgyz President Sadir Japarov.
&gt; 
&gt; The official made his remarks on Nov. 9, during a press conference organized by the Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan to unveil its construction plans for the new Cathedral in the national capital Bishkek, Vatican's Fides news agency reported on Nov. 14.

&gt; 
&gt; “The construction of the new church will also have an international significance,” Dil said.
&gt; 
&gt; The official stated that the project was not only a key development for the people of the catholic faith but also for all Kyrgyz people.
&gt; 
&gt; Without revealing an expected start date the officials from the Apostolic Administration stated that cathedral construction may start during the winter months between December 2022 to April 2023 and end in three years.
&gt; 
&gt; Jesuit Father Anthony James Corcoran, Apostolic Administrator of Kyrgyzstan Pope Francis encouraged the Church's mission in the country during his recent Papal visit to Kazakhstan.
&gt; 
&gt; The Pope also blessed the cathedral's first stone during his visit to Nur Sultan in Kazakhstan in September 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; Jesuit Brother Damian Wojciechowski, treasurer of the Apostolic Administration of Kyrgyzstan stated that the present church of the World War II era was located at the periphery of the city making it virtually invisible.
&gt; 
&gt; ""In a country with a Muslim majority, there are those who do not even know the existence of the parish far from the center,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “They paved the road that leads to the church only a year ago,"" Brother Wojciechowski said highlighting the transportation and connectivity issues in the region.
&gt; 
&gt; The existing church was constructed during the Soviet era in 1969 for a small community of German Catholics who were deported during the Second World War.
&gt; 
&gt; Brother Wojciechowski also highlighted that the new cathedral would solve the space constraints that hinder the service provided to the gradually increasing Catholics in the capital city.
&gt; 
&gt; “The spaces we have now are limited and do not allow us to carry out all the activities we would like.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Thanks to the new premises adjacent to the cathedral, we will be able to propose a series of cultural initiatives, prayer and Bible reading meetings, aimed at different age groups,” Brother Wojciechowski added.
&gt; 
&gt; Church officials in the country estimate that around 500 Catholics attend church services at seven parishes located across the country. The country has a total population of 6.6 million, according to the World Bank in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite being a minuscule minority in the country, the Catholic Church has never backed down in its charitable activities for the people of Kyrgyzstan who face poverty and corruption in a rapidly growing economy, says Brother Wojciechowski.
&gt; 
&gt; “Proclaiming the Gospel also means helping the new generations to orient their lives towards building a more just and welcoming society for all,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The three main Catholic churches are located in Bishkek, Jalal-Abad, and Talas.
&gt; 
&gt; Catholics who live in far-flung parishes gather to pray in private homes and receive periodical visits from the missionaries who work in the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Jesuits are the leading group among the Catholic missionaries working in the country. The ten Jesuits hail from various nationalities including Slovenia, Vietnam, the United States, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Poland.
&gt; 
&gt; Members of other congregations include five nuns from School Sisters of St. Francis, three Consolata Missionary Sisters, and a diocesan priest from Slovakia.
&gt; 
&gt; Some nuns from the Missionary Sisters of Charity congregation founded by Mother Teresa have also arrived in Bishkek and that they would open their convent soon in the capital, Fides reported.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1999, Pope John Paul II erected an independent mission in Kyrgyzstan, and Pope Benedict XVI set up the Apostolic Administration in 2006.

2) Gradually get him back together with Stephanie over time.  Making it a ""slow burn"" and convincing the readers it is something worth rooting for and supporting is key here.

3) Avoid the ""they are cancelling MY Robin"" issue by having the ongoing series be simply called Gotham Knights and being a ""Bat Brothers"" book staring Tim, Damian, and Duke the same way that Batgirls stars Babs, Steph, and Cass at the moment.  I would also spend some time fixing Tim and Damian's relationship as they never seemed to truly work through their issues with each other on page.

3) I would send the cast off to the next small city up the coast for college (the writer can use some excuse to get Damian involved).  The city should be somehow distinct from Bludhaven and Gotham.  I would name it Miskatonic and the school Tim and Duke are attending be the prestigious Miskatonic University as a homage to Lovecraft just like Arkham Asylum is.  I would base the general aesthetic of the city around the ""Gothic"" section of Gotham rather than the ""urban decay"" part of Gotham that Bludhaven seems to have locked down so that you could have the creepy libraries and museums as cool backdrops for the series and also connect it back to the Lovecraft idea by having the crimes be slightly more supernatural based (i.e. ""that crime boss just brought those gargoyles to life to kill us"" or ""is that fraternity REALLY including human sacrifice as part of their hazing ritual"" rather than the ""Felix Faust just fired the Blue Pillar of Doom into the sky for the third time this week"").  This city could also be slightly more ""suburban"" and have dark forests and corn fields as part of its ""thing"".

^(By Tom Decent, November 8, 2022 — 3.11pm)

&gt;Florence: Wallabies coach Dave Rennie has defended some controversial late selection calls in Australia’s one-point loss to France and said he disagreed with a key call by referee Jaco Peyper in the dying minutes of the tense Test in Paris.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the Wallabies turn their attention to the Test against Italy in Florence this weekend, there is an underlying feeling of what might have been among the Australian players, who know they missed a golden chance to beat the team many regard as the favourite for next year’s World Cup.  
&gt;  
&gt;Halfback Nic White summed up the side’s frustration after a 30-29 loss in Paris.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s quiet \[in the change rooms\] because it hurts losing like that,” White told the Herald. “We pushed them right to the edge and had them there for a bit. There’s positives there, it’s just hard to see right now.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Wallabies’ grand dreams of a spring tour grand slam were all but extinguished when Damian Penaud beat defenders Tom Wright and Jock Campbell to score in the 76th minute.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few minutes earlier, Rennie had benched starting five-eighth Bernard Foley in the 72nd minute, bringing on Reece Hodge just as France kicked a penalty to trail 26-25.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hodge’s restart was a shocker - the kick didn’t get above knee height - but the Wallabies regained possession a few rucks later. Australia then went ahead 29-25, courtesy of a Hodge penalty, before falling short by a point.  
&gt;  
&gt;Former Wallaby Drew Mitchell said during Stan Sport’s coverage the decision to hook Foley was “interesting”.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think it was a poor substitution taking Bernard Foley off,” Mitchell said after the game.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You’ve got seven minutes to play and you take your key decision-maker off? \[It is\] not so much \[about\] Reece Hodge - I’d get him on somewhere - but at 10 was a poor decision.  
&gt;  
&gt;“\[Foley is\] the key communicator, the driver, the steerer of the ship. Having someone who’s not a \[specialist\] 10 come on to play 10 in the most crucial moment of the game?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Rennie explained to the Herald why he went that way in the final minutes with the game on the line.  
&gt;  
&gt;Asked if he had any regrets, Rennie said: “No. We brought Hodgey on because we were in front. He’s a bigger defensive body and has a big boot. That was the thinking around 10.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The other decision questioned by Wallabies fans was the call to bring Michael Hooper off in the 71st minute. Hooper is renowned for his ability to play 80-minute matches. When Rennie substituted him in Paris, it was the first time since August 2018 he’d not gone the full 80.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With Hoops, he was just gassed. He looked gassed after about 50 minutes,” said Rennie of his back-rower who’d only played one Test prior since early August. “There was a lot of kicking and as you know with him, when there’s kicks, he’s going full throttle. They kicked the ball 36 times. He got a second wind for a while.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We wanted to get \[reserve back-rower\] Pete Samu on. We needed Jed \[Holloway\] on from a lineout perspective with Will \[Skelton\] on the field and defensively Bobby \[Valetini\] is a bigger body. That’s why we took Hoops off.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Rennie was also quizzed about Folau Fainga’a lineout work. The hooker’s first throw was picked off by France and his last, with two minutes remaining, was deemed not straight.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was a textbook coach-killer and a golden opportunity that went begging for the Wallabies.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, Rennie said he felt Peyper got the call wrong. In his view, the ball was thrown in straight enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I don’t agree with the last call. It was on the inside shoulder,” Rennie said. “It certainly wasn’t consistent with other decisions made in the game. The first one he threw short. We picked off a couple of their lineouts too. You’ve got two competitive sides going at it.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It is what it is. \[Lineouts\] is a strong part of the game and an important part of it. It would have been good to get a little bit more territory in the second half so we could launch from up there.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1668058191.0,,False,0.0,{},ivs771m,True,t3_yr6br9,False,t1_ivs771m,False,t3_yr6br9,/r/RugbyAustralia/comments/yr6br9/rennie_defends_benching_foley/ivs771m/,1671148410.0,5.0,False,True,False,RugbyAustralia,t5_3olov5,r/RugbyAustralia,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So this is one of many theories I've thought about. What if because we were introduced to murderer or killer marker can't remember which name in part 2 of in space. Was actually the one who pushed actor Mark off the top floor of the Manor in who killed Markiplier. So hear me out.

So going back to the beginning of the first video of who killed Markiplier who do we walk up to as we're approaching the manor? The colonel and he mentioned some stuff if I can recall correctly that sounds like it's degrading on actor Mark and if you remember from the entire thing they were talking about having basically a friend group with the colonel Etc.

So I have a theory. What if after you who is I believe Damian who gets possessed later on by darkiplier because actor Mark who always has to be the hero in every movie needs to be the hero and he needs a equally bad villain so following this out just hear me out I know it's crazy this is a 5-minute Theory combined with some other theories I had. So they mentioned they were good friends and then you moved off aka the perspective of who you're looking at who's played by Ethan the cameraman. And after you moved away the group kind of fell apart and something had to do with Celine either a love triangle or something like that. So you and everybody else who was originally in this friend group plus the detective who is a big part of the story anyway it's later on all come out for a poker night at Markiplier Manor and his little key points why was the detective there also why would the detective be there if not place there already by actor Mark who had some Intel who informed him that he was going to be off the very next day because if you remember in the very first episode or second I can't keep it together you walk out of your room after having a massive hangover and he comes falling down from the second story or third story or how big that place was. So with that being said there had to been a motive of why someone was hired to do it and not only that another thing is why was the colonel there other than he was probably part of the friends group I can't remember that detail either correctly but here's the thing about that they needed a ploy who was a perfect Marksman who did all this stuff that colonel so.. if the colonel was there he's the one to take the fall why because the mayor who obviously does have the power to hire someone to take out actor Mark who was informed who had the detective there in the first place.. killer Mark was hired for the hit on actor Mark from the mayor and they needed someone to take the blame so the colonel AKA Wolford mother loving Wharf stash had to be the person to take the blame also for the fact they were arguing when you were walking on the second or third floor I can't remember which floor.. which turned the kernel into Wilford Wharf stash after he had shot you the viewer and you fell and he thought you had died but in fact that was the point where you were talking to Selena and the mayor which leads into the short video which was perfectly animated called Damian which lexian did make the video game about... my synopsis for just who did it was killer mark because he had to hit on aftermark which in fact was placed on him by the mayor because the mayor didn't like the fact that actor Mark was being mean to everybody that's an appropriate way I'm going to say it I don't know how to say it really.

1) Movies and tv series rarely go long enough to do them justice. Sure, they have had shows like Young Justice, Teen Titans, Teen Titans Go and the live action Titans, but I mean a universe where characters like Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Flash are set up for several movies or seasons, getting sidekicks along the way, and then those sidekicks team up to step out of the shadow of their mentors and make friends with newer characters like Starfire, Beast Boy and Raven. Young Justice came the closest to doing this, but I feel like the time skips hurt, especially the first one of five years.

2) They age their mentors. Realistically, Bruce, Clark, Barry and their contemporaries should be in their early forties, Dick, Donna, Wally and Roy should be in their mid-twenties, Tim, Cassie, Connor and Bart around 18 and Damian's lot around 13 or 14. But some writers seem a bit weird about making Bruce, Clark and Barry that old, even though they should be. Seriously, there are some points where it's felt like there's probably only eight years between Bruce and Dick, and other times where it has seemed like Jason might be older than Dick!

3) The constant creation of new characters. Admittedly, the Titans aren't the only ones affected by this, but they are some of the best examples. How many Robin or Robin-like characters are there running around now? How many Speedys/Red Arrows/Arrowettes? How many Kid Flashes/Impulses/Whatevers? Someone at editorial needs to reign this stuff in. Someone has a story pitch for a female member of the flash family? Tell them to make it about Jessie Quick, Avery Ho or Irey West, or they can't do it. Got a Robin pitch? There's forty of them running around somewhere in Gotham. Pick one, don't make a new one.

This is called a practical, reasonable, and logical answer in a situation of two strong differing opinions. 💯 The truth is always somewhere in the middle. 

I agree, people are overreacting, but at the same time - there has to be a point of realism - developing a recent 19 y/o, a 20 y/o, and 21 y/o who basically have no real playing time in seasons past and expecting them to make up your bench and be your 7th, 8th, 9th best players and provide key elements missing - in a seasons time. Then throw in how NEXT LEVEL teams turn up in the playoffs and the REAL PRESSURE to perform is on. 

It's just not realistic. Quite the conundrum. ESPECIALLY come playoff time.  


Was there no 1 year contract minimum vets that could have come in?  


I mean outside of our starters (and excluding Jamychal's 13 minutes per game) the average age of our bench for guys who actually see the floor is 21.8 years old!!!

Literally, just think about that.   


You have baby's mentoring baby's out there ""in real game time situations"".   
That feels like a recipe for disaster come playoff time, a bunch of kids who just became legal to order a beer. Lol. In a potential 30 game (including worse case 2 play-in games) battle royale for the 🏆.   


You need leaders out there on the floor with them, as those GPII, JTA, Damian Lee's etc. type guys that ADD SYNERGY and confidence/calm out there through there leadership/communication/self-confidence. It's contagious. We have literally Poole, trying to play Iverson out there,  leading these guys - who he himself still needs it. 

Is there no guys in FA's out there we can bring in on or trade with low assets who can at least provide veteran leadership off the bench (league minimum contract/ring chaser)?  


I mean even just for the aspect of depth. WTF happens if 1 of our starters goes down come playoff time? So confused how we didn't better address this in the off season.

I kinda like the contrary idea to the ""All Caste Champion is in town then they are gonna scatter point"", being that just few people know what the All Caste are. They are ancient and secretive. Like Blood has only heard about them in one book that was written 1,000 years ago, a few mentions from before he was even born. Xanadu can't see them due to their wards protecting them. Like most in the magic community that don't even believe they exist, which might allow Jason to stay closer to the ground than world ending cause he's not rushing to prove the existence of a sect of magic users that have already been wiped out and will probably die with him...

On that second note it doesn't surprise me per se, but does make me laugh that Damian and Bruce are having a rough time rn cause a demon from a Lazarus pit is possessing them.... like oh no if only you had a member of your immediate family that specializes in handling demons from Lazarus pits (Untitled come from Well of Sin, an ancient Pit), and who's first mystic move they ever learned was how to exorcize demons from somebody's body..... yeah Bruce....

Nothing against Cass, but I just don’t see it. Again other than NML, Cass isn’t a key player any of the real essential Batman stories. Barbara had been Oracle for 10 years by the time Cass was introduced. Batman and Oracle had been working together regularly by the time Cass came long. Barbara had already made the transition to becoming Oracle well before Cass. Cass wasn’t even a big part of Oracle’s main title that explored most of her development, *Birds of Prey*. Her dynamic with the characters of Black Canary, Batman, and Nightwing received far more attention there.

Honestly I want a creator to write a definitive Batman story which makes Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown vital to the mythos and Batman’s history. But no one really has yet.

Stephanie had a less important role narratively, but she was there -- front and center -- the whole time.  Sure -- you are correct about her having a minimal role in No Man's Land -- but she was a main character in Batman's world from her introduction up until the start of New 52.

To me, removing Stephanie is like removing Ned Flanders from the Simpsons.  Sure, I won't arue with anybody that says he's ultimately unnecessary, but... He's had a prominent role in the series since his introduction, he's been involved in some seriously notable stories, and his interactions with the main characters brougt so much to their development and the development of Springfield as a setting... Why would you take Flanders out if you're leaving in Apu and Chief Wiggum?  Forgive the very very weird example. 😅

I never meant to imply that *War Games* or *BW: Murderer?/Fugitive* were essentials.  Rather that these were well established key players for a substantial chunk of Batman's history and that the most reasonable thing to do would be to keep their histories intact.  You *absolutely* could remove Tim and nothing would change either, but I still think characters like Cassandra and Tim have earned their damn tenure at this point.

Becky Lynch 96 and Tucker 71, and so forth.  (Felt bad about flipping Asuka and Slapjack though)  Of course, I rapidly ran out of women so the midcard dudes (82-86) lucked out.

I also tried to set up match tables to have the occasional title match.  And as usual, no matter what numbers I put into the match table that means that every title is on the line every week.

Lynch lost her title immediately.  As did Nikki/Ripley.   Damian Priest has held steady, but he was never flipped.  RK-Bros flip merely brought them down to their competition's level.  Still more than enough to win all their endless matches against the Street Profits.

Brock?  Despite being Lanafied is just as dominant as ever, go figure.

Sure, they're all former World Champions, but I think there's more than a 7 point difference between longtime Jobber-To-The-Stars Dolph Ziggler and a Macho Man, Ric Flair, and Ultimate Warrior that are all supposed to be their peak versions.

Most people were giving the kind of cotton candy ""flaws but not really"" that Superman gets labeled with. People will say that his flaws are that he cares ""too much"", that he's ""too nice a guy"", and other various flaws that aren’t actually flaws but people pretend they are to avoid accusations that Superman is a Mary Sue. Here’s the thing though: he actually does have flaws. Serious ones that tend to bite him in the ass frequently. I wanted to do this post on the big one: of the Deadly Sins, Superman’s Sin is Wrath. This is something that actually is remarkably consistent across multiple incarnations of the character. Running through some of the big examples from pics I posted:

Our very first image of Superman ever from Action Comics #1? Not a wholesome happy cover depicting him smiling down on us, but a guy smashing a car against a rock in rage as onlookers gasp in terror. Golden Age Superman was not a figure to be messed with, he had no problems beating down anyone who got on his bad side. While much has changed since Superman’s debut, that anger is still present in the versions of the character since as I hope to point out going forward.

Alan Moore frequently depicted an angry Superman with a dark temper. In the classic For The Man Who Has Everything, Superman is enraged to the point of being willing to kill Mongul after he escapes the dream reality Mongul placed him in. Only seeing his Kryptonian parents statues causes him to hesitate from delivering the death blow. Another famous Superman story by Moore has Superman again enraged to the point of being willing to kill, in the famous Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? Superman gets terrifyingly angry twice. Once upon being outed in his secret identity by Toyman and Prankster, and a second time upon learning that his childhood crush Lana Lang died at the hands of some of his supervillains. Superman almost kills two times before finally crossing that line with Mxy at the end.

Mark Waid is widely regarded as one of Superman’s best writers, and he frequently writes a Superman struggling to control his temper. In his origin for Superman, Birthright, Superman in a rage fires a bullet at a gun seller who sold guns to a school shooter (itself a callback to an old Golden Age story). But I wanted to focus on what is likely Waid’s most famous Superman story: Kingdom Come. Here Superman’s struggle to control his anger is pivotal in two key moments. First there is when Magog kills Joker and the public supports him for it. Clark is pissed off at this to the point he quits being a hero entirely, and bears a grudge over it to the point he taunts Magog about his failures in the nuclear wasteland of Kansas. Second is after the UN nukes the heroes in a bid to rid themselves of superhumans. Clark believes he is the only survivor and promptly loses his shit, going straight to the UN where he seals everyone in and almost bring the house down on their heads Samson style. Only the intervention of the preacher’s appeals causes Clark to regain control of himself again.

All-Star Superman, the most wholesome of all Supermen. No way would this guy have a temper right? Wrong. Upon learning that Superman has a terminal illness, Atlas and Samson attempt to move in on Lois Lane in hopes of getting her to ditch Supes for them. After putting up with their crap for a day, Clark finally gets fed up with them, takes them both on in a game of arm wrestling, and breaks their arms for trying to take his girl.

Another long term writer for Superman, Dan Jurgens wrote a story about Superman dealing with domestic abusers. Superman once threw a wife-beater out a window to scare him (calling back to the Golden Age story where he did this), which inspired the wife to try to leave her husband... only for the husband to kill her. Superman is not happy when he hears about this, tracks the husband down, and is seriously considering killing him in retaliation, only for the wife’s surviving family to intervene and ask Supes to spare the husband which he does.

Ah Superman Rebirth, a book well loved for it’s wholesome vibes. It’s also a run with a Superman who isn’t afraid to break out the heat vision when he’s angry. Aside from immediately letting loose with said heat vision in rage after spotting Manchester Black, the other big case of Superman giving in to wrath is finding out Damian abducted his son Jon. Clark is pissed and thinks the Waynes are running experiments on his son, and is ready to beat the hell out of Batman in retaliation, Jon has to unleash arctic breath in order to get his dad to cool down.

Alright so a lot of these examples show other people intervening to stop Superman, I thought it was important to demonstrate that Clark is capable of stopping himself too. I know you guys think Bendis sucks, but he wrote a perfect example of Clark struggling with rage yet being able to reel himself in. After being dragged into the Phantom Zone, Superman is resentful towards the place and fantasizes about destroying the whole dimension. But he knows this is wrong, and his conscience in the form of his Earth parents appears, and gently reminds him that life is testing him, and it wouldn’t be a test if it wasn’t difficult, calming him down. Great moment there.

What’s So Funny About Truth, Justice, and The American Way? Is an iconic story of a wrathful Superman. At the end he beats on the Elite pretty badly, both to drive home his point that power without morals leaves you at the mercy of those stronger than you, and also because frankly? He really hates Manchester Black’s guts and wants to kick his ass.

Kurt Busiek is another fantastic Superman writer and writer in general. His best Superman work in my estimation is Secret Identity which focuses on a “what if Superman was real?” premise. At one point Clark gets captured by the feds and is trapped in a lab. He breaks loose and on his way out, he finds a lab full of the bodies of others who got powers and were captured. One of the corpses is a baby, which absolutely enrages Clark. He burns the compound to ashes in retaliation, dragging the soldiers out so they won’t die in the blaze.

Geoff Johns’ Superman oscillates between being Chris Reeve and a guy you don’t want to mess with. Upon finding out that the government has a Kryptonian child in their custody, Supes forces his way to the compound where the kid is, and lets the military know they better not try and keep him, or else. Doesn’t earn him any friends, but Clark doesn’t care, he’s furious at the idea of the kid being locked up.

Phillip Kennedy Johnson who is currently on Action Comics and is on his way to being in my top 10 Superman writers, also features a Superman who can let his anger get the best of him. Mongul knows that Superman is weakened after being exposed to a Breach in space, so he baits Superman to come to Warworld by sending him some Phaelosian (Kryptonian offshoot race) slaves, with their presence alerting Clark to the rest of their people still trapped on Warworld. Having lost the ability to call on the JL to follow him, Clark is forced to build a new team to make up for his loss in power, and even then they still end up losing to Mongul. Clark was angry enough over learning about the slaves Mongul had that he rushed in without proper backup and preparation, and ended up spending a long period as a slave as a result.

The last one is some delicious irony that I only recently found out and had to share. Remember DC Universe Online? Well it had a tie in comics series just like Injustice although it came out before Injustice. In that series Superman is tricked into unintentionally killing Lois. Both of them were infected with nanobots by Brainiac that laid dormant until they met each other. When they did, the bots in Lois sent a signal to the bots in Superman that triggered his heat vision, burning Lois to death. Obviously, he doesn’t take it well, and almost kills Lex for his role in causing that to happen. Only Wonder Woman is able to talk him down (too bad her Injustice counterpart was an evil bitch). The artist for this is the same artist for Injustice and Tom Taylor, writer for Injustice, wrote the last two issues of the series which I thought was hilarious. But it’s an example of Superman’s rage almost costing him his morality, but this incarnation was able to pull back from the brink in a way his Injustice counterpart was not.

I could keep going but I think I have enough examples to make my point. Superman’s Wrath is a consistent enough character trait that it feels weird to not see it appear. Writers have incorporated it into their stories often enough that I think it’s an essential component to who he is, especially since it can be traced back to his creators Siegel and Shuster. Superman has other flaws of course, but when it comes to his biggest? Wrath is it.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1665815296.0,,1665815590.0,0.0,{'gid_1': 1},isdziim,True,t3_y4gie8,False,t1_isdziim,False,t3_y4gie8,/r/superman/comments/y4gie8/supermans_deadly_sin_wrath/isdziim/,1667943317.0,22.0,False,True,False,superman,t5_2qrwe,r/superman,public,,1.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twitter created what we now recognize as ""a hashtag movement,"" meaning that a single hashtag can do anything from crash company stocks to establishing real societal change. This is the power &amp; terror of Twitter. 

Here are the movements that are most beneficial for writers &amp; creatives:

1) **Writing prompts.**  This is a fun way to make your writing more concise through practice, plus it gives you free publicity for your pinned tweet (which should be your website or one of your books). 

Follow the accounts **PromptList** &amp; **PromptAdvant**. These accounts retweet listed prompts on any given day, such as:

*#Madverse, #SunWIP, #SeduceMeSunday, #Whistpr, #Vss365, #VssPoem, #VssDaily Porridge, #VssHumour, #VssMystery, #VssMurder, #horrorprompts, #VssHauntedHouse, #WeirdVSS, #SatSplat, #AchtenWrite, #writerslife #lovewriting, &amp; #writeeveryday for example.* 

There is literally a hashtag for every genre &amp; subgenre. Be sure to retweet the work of others &amp; also the prompt post itself to gain traffic to your account. Scan the community of each hashtag, see if you like them &amp; have fun.

**Other writing hashtags of note:** *#writingadvice #writetillyoudrop #writer #writeradvice #adviceforwriters #advice #tip #writertips #tipsforwriters #nanowrimo, #amwriting, #iamwriting, #writingcommunity*

**For songwriters:** *#songwriter #singer #music #musician #artist #newmusic #producer #singersongwriter #hiphop #love #musicproducer #rap #song #rapper #guitar #spotify #beats #instamusic #livemusic #musicvideo #pop #art #guitarist #rnb #unsignedartist #youtube #rock #soundcloud #studio #songs* 

*(Also I heard Damian Keyes might be a good resource through his website; if not, just see who he follows on Twitter &amp; follow those accounts instead to learn).*

2) **The #WritersLift hashtag community.** It's not true that writers just create an echo chamber. Writers are also readers. The Twitter writing community will purchase, support &amp; hype your work as long as you return the favor. Authors there have been known to make record sales in a day or land high-paying gigs just because they participated in a #writerslift hosted by a popular account. 

3) **Open call submission/pitch hashtags**:  Literary Agents, Magazines, &amp; Publishers have been holding open calls on Twitter for years. In fact, there are several literary publications that accept submissions exclusively through Twitter or Submittable. Even email has gone to the wayside with the industry. 

**Ones to know:** \#DVpitch, #IWSGPit, #PitMad. 

**Submission hashtags w/ upcoming deadlines:**  

OCT 20 #pitdark, OCT 27 #PBpitch  
NOV 03 #moodpitch  
DEC 10 #pitlight  
\--2023--  
JAN 25 #IWSGpit, JAN 26 #KidLitPit

That should get you started. And remember: Twitter works best if you are having FUN and making actual FRIENDS on these hashtags communities. This is also practice for being an active literary presence in your local community. 

Hope that helps.

But I'll go a step further and say that Warriors is a decent answer even if we want to know which team will have the most efficient offense this season:

(1) First it bears mentioning that Offensive Rating is not a perfect measure of efficiency. A team could send 3+ guys to the offensive boards regularly and up their ORTG significantly. They could also release guys on the opponents' shots (or more extreme: leave a guy in the backcourt) to score more easy transition baskets and so help their ORTG.  However these are bad tradeoffs most teams won't make.  TS is not really an improvement it suffers from the same problems and also doesn't count turnovers.  What we're really after is offensive efficiency with context. 

(1a) The Warriors are 29th in OREB, partly a talent issue, partly because they prioritize getting back on defense.  They are also 2nd in defensive rebounding and Kerr has often preached the need for 5 guys to box out because of their size issues. The net effect of these two sensible choices is a few points of ORTG a year.    

(2) In 2021-22 the Warriors dealt with a number of key injuries - Klay for 2 months with 3 more months of shaky ramp up, Dray for 2 months plus 5 bad games when he came back, Steph for a month. Technically also Wiseman but it's unclear if that helped or hurt them. Soaking these minutes, among others were 2 rookies, Damian Lee, Bjelica, JTA, and Chioza Those 6 players had the worst O-RAPTOR scores on the Warriors last season and combined for over 5500 minutes.  This year the rookies and Wiseman should be and look improved and the other 4 are gone. On top of that JP continues to improve and the Big 3 should play more minutes.  

(2a) In the playoffs when they were relatively healthy the Warriors had the #4 ORTG despite facing the #2 (BOS), #4 (MEM), and #6 (DAL) teams in DRTG during the regular season (DEN was #15 not great but not terrible as people imply). Their offensive rating in the playoffs was 115.2, which in the regular season would have been 3rd behind only Utah (blown up), and Atlanta. Obviously playoff minutes for starters are higher but the Warriors played deeper in the bench through the playoffs than any other team and their Big 4 averaged 34 mpg in the playoffs.  OTOH adjusting for quality of opponent will raise that ORTG by at least as much as discounting a few mpg would.  

(3) All of that said, DEN and ATL would also have a case just as good if not better.  But GSW isn't a bad choice, I'd expect them to be top 4-5 in the league.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1665407965.0,,False,0.0,{},irraf5p,False,t3_y01yt1,False,t1_irraf5p,False,t1_irq311c,/r/nbadiscussion/comments/y01yt1/gm_rankings_vs_media_or_fan_rankings/irraf5p/,1667967805.0,32.0,False,True,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,r/nbadiscussion,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,,raiph,1250026792.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3l1mc,False,False,"&gt; My own would certainly be considered toys when compared with popular, mainstream languages with large ecosystems, libraries and communities. Probably 95% of what people expect now from a language would be missing from mine.

I'd say that's a different aspect that's orthogonal to the toy vs tool axis.

One of the advantages of creating languages with Raku is you can leverage its ecosystem in the same kind of way JVM languages can leverage that ecosystem. So a toy language can actually get a mature ecosystem's power more or less for free.

(Except with Raku you gain much greater benefits.¹)

&gt;Yet I have used older, even cruder versions to write commercial applications. People have used the associated scripting language to create add-on products. The two languages sustained a product generating perhaps $1m a year in business.

Absolutely. I recall creating a mini language system in 1985 which my employer used to make many times the cost of my salary for the 9 months I spent creating it.

&gt;So they could definitely get real stuff done. It just shows the gulf between a language that can be implemented in a few dozen lines (even on top of the doubtless greater number of lines to make that possible), and those C++s or Rusts is even more massive.

Yes, a toy can be made in an hour but a tool is a whole different kettle of fish.

A programming language can be either a toy or a tool.

I responded to someone asking this sub ""How do I create a programming language?"". Imo such a question invites comments guiding them to consider starting by making toys, especially if the tool they're using to create the toys is also great for creating industrial strength tools and languages.

&gt;&gt;Rakudo, an industrial strength compiler, is written with the same tools. That said, its git repo shows it's had over 36,000 commits over a 15 year period. Like I said, years, even lifetimes, of blood, sweat, and tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;I heard once that an Ada compiler would take 50 man-years to create, and a C++ one (this would have been in the 90s when it was a lot smaller) some 10 man-years.

Yes. While Raku has a tiny core as a language, it took a large group of folk (nearly 1,000 are credited in the first official release of Rakudo) more than a decade to nail down alongside a huge rich standard library that worked well and battle tested the core. Indeed that process is still ongoing; Raku was designed from the start with the notion of languages as evolving things that never stop evolving.

&gt;&gt; I don't mean your implementations are so great you'd win awards -- I don't know, maybe you would  
&gt;  
&gt;They wouldn't. Mainly they were created on the side when I was supposed to be getting on with other things. They targeted only the platform of interest, and concentrated on the features I used. I worked around the bugs and omissions.

This is the truth of most programming and programs. I see no reason why programming programming languages should be any different.

Raku the language and its standard libraries, the Rakudo compiler, the MoarVM vm, the Comma IDE, and so on, all have tons of known bugs and no doubt far more unknown, and it will always be that way. Same goes for cpython, javac, ghc, and on and on...

----

¹ Except with Raku you gain much greater benefits:

* It was designed from the ground up with the notion of ""Let any and all languages and language devs cooperate"". It took two decades to get Raku to its current state of polish, and it'll take another to make it really shine, but a key thing is that it's language interop design was there from the get go, not bolted on at the end as happened with the JVM and Sun's original vision of Java.

* Raku's culture will always be a world of radical FLOSS luminaries like Larry Wall, Damian Conway, Audrey Tang and Jonathan Worthington. Contrast that with the way the Java/JVM/Graal/Truffle ecosystem is dominated by Oracle's desire to control it and make huge amounts of money from it.

* Raku extends language interop to working with existing PLs and their existing implementations, which is why/how Raku programs, and languages created using Raku, can use all those existing modules.

Normally it’s the league’s quietest month. Everybody is on vacation until Labor Day, and then they start ambling back into the gym in the days and weeks that follow. Transactions? Sure, for two-ways and Exhibit 10 guys, but nothing that will meaningfully change the team’s trajectory.

And then there are the 2022-23 Boston Celtics. They left August as a favorite to win the NBA championship, with a still-young team that lost in six games in the NBA Finals, a hot coach entering his second season and a reloaded roster that added knockdown shooters Malcolm Brogdon and Danilo Gallinari.

Then September happened, when the Celtics:

Lost Gallinari to a season-ending knee injury at EuroBasket.
Lost Robert Williams III for the start of this season (at least) to a second knee surgery.
Lost coach Ime Udoka after he was suspended for the 2022-23 season for “violations of team policies.”
I can’t recall a team having three losses of this magnitude in September like this; it felt like a retaliatory karmic curse for the Pierce-Garnett trade, or maybe for continually playing Neil Diamond in the arena.

Additionally, these three losses compounded upon one another. Frontcourt depth was already looming as a bit of a problem for the Celtics heading into the season, but the addition of Gallinari with their taxpayer midlevel exception should have solved that issue. Gallo can occasionally masquerade as a five but more importantly could have soaked up enough time as a stretch four to let Al Horford man the middle for extended minutes. Meanwhile, losing Williams for at least the first several weeks of the season — plus the expectation that it might be a long road back after two knee operations in six months — further weakens the Celtics up front.

Finally, Williams and Udoka were the two keys to the biggest change Boston made last season. Udoka shifted the Celtics to a much more switch-based approach on defense that suffocated opponents throughout the second half of the season, while Williams was the mainstay of said defense. When healthy, he was a more valuable piece even than Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart. Even when Golden State seemingly solved Boston’s defense in the finals, that mostly happened in the non-Williams minutes; he was just too injured to play longer.

The Celtics shouldn’t panic: Even without Williams, their seven best players are better than yours. They still have two All-Star-caliber wings in Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown and shored up the backcourt rotation with an elite shooter in Brogdon. In addition to Smart, they have top-tier role players such as Horford, Grant Williams and Derrick White. The trade for White at midseason was a master stroke that solidified the rotation, with Boston zipping to a 28-7 finish to the season.

Brogdon seemed to be another massive acquisition after Boston’s backcourt proved a bit too tepid offensively in the playoffs. Last time he was able to be a role player on an elite team (the 2019 Bucks), he shot 42.6 percent from 3; he’s also one of the game’s best foul shooters. (His 88.1 percent career mark is topped only by Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving among qualifying active players.) Trading a late first and a slew of fungible players for him was an absolute no-brainer.

Deeper on the bench are two other decent options in Grant Williams and Payton Pritchard; Williams becomes very important now, as he’ll need to soak up frontcourt minutes with Gallinari out and Robert Williams uncertain. However, the backcourt is now crowded enough that one wonders if Boston should trade Pritchard for more size.

The problem is that you can’t get through a season with seven players, which is why we can add one more bullet to the slew of late-summer negatives above:

Why didn’t they sign any more basketball players?
In the 20-20 hindsight view of Boston’s 2022 offseason, this is going to be the biggest question. Fresh off its NBA Finals disappointment, the Celtics got to business right away by acquiring Brogdon and signing Gallinari with its taxpayer midlevel exception … and then they just kind of stopped. Even though they had five open roster spots.

From July 15 to late September, the Celtics didn’t make any moves on their main roster. In early July, they did re-sign Luke Kornet to a partially guaranteed deal and Sam Hauser to a minimum. While these aren’t really the minimum-contract veterans whom contenders look to add, that took their roster to 12 players … and then they called it good. (As a reminder, league rules require 14 roster spots filled, and teams can carry up to 15.)

What looked like a minor quibble for an otherwise surefire champion favorite turned into a major problem once the September woes hit. Heading into training camp, Boston’s only players taller than 6-foot-8 were the 35-year-old Horford and Kornet, who played 103 total minutes for three teams last season. Boston backfilled with the late addition of Blake Griffin — the same guy they tortured in the first round of the playoffs last season — but the Celtics likely could have done significantly better had they expended much effort in this direction earlier.

It’s the most dumbfounding offseason move that nobody is talking about. Even as other teams filled out their rosters with veteran players signing for the minimum or intriguing “second draft” players, Boston stood pat. It’s not clear to me if the Celtics were trying to finesse the luxury tax (they’re already in deeper than this franchise has historically gone) or something else happened, but now it’s a problem. Suddenly, Hauser is their ninth-best healthy player. My fellow Wahoo shoots well enough that he has a chance to be something, but this isn’t a flier anymore. He’s somebody they’re counting on.

After 12 years in power, the party is fragmented and in a perennial argument with itself over the right way forward. The rapid turnover of Tory leaders in recent years has left a legacy of former ministers kicking their heels on the backbenchers. 

  
And as this week’s party conference has shown, many of them are not afraid to criticise the Prime Minister who left them marginalised.

  
When Parliament reconvenes on Oct 11, Ms Truss will find out just how easy or difficult it is going to be to get her most contentious legislation passed into law.

  
Here we examine six of the groups that will be key to Ms Truss’s survival.

  
**The hard Right**

Ms Truss’s most natural constituency is among the hard Right wing of the party which wants low tax, low government spending and tough immigration policies.

  
Leading lights including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Baker and Suella Braverman have been given ministerial posts, and they will become the Prime Minister’s Praetorian Guard when her back is against the wall.

  
The mini-Budget was aimed at them, but they are annoyed that the Prime Minister and Kwasi Kwarteng made such a hash of the 45p tax rate cut that it is likely to be off the table for a generation. 

  
There is a large overlap with formal factions such as the Common Sense Group of Tories, led by Sir John Hayes, and the anti-lockdown Covid Recovery Group, led by Mark Harper.  
If this faction starts to turn on Ms Truss, her premiership will be over.

&amp;#x200B;

**Disaffected Sunakites**

While Ms Truss won over Conservative Party members, she did not win over MPs, who preferred Rishi Sunak’s more cautious economic approach and who believe they have been vindicated by the turmoil of Ms Truss’s premiership.

  
As well as Mr Sunak himself, they include such big names as Dominic Raab, the former foreign secretary, and Oliver Dowden, the former party chairman. Many of them believe their ministerial careers are over and that they will either lose their seats or stand down at the next election, so they have little reason to show loyalty to Ms Truss. 

  
Some are talking about “damage limitation” – showing their constituents that they do not agree with the Prime Minister in the hope that they can minimise losses at the next general election.

  
Others believe that if they quietly bide their time, Ms Truss’s premiership will come to a premature end and Mr Sunak will get another chance to govern. They are notably absent from the party conference.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boris mourners**

Surveys suggest that about a third of party members would still prefer Boris Johnson to be prime minister, and there are those on the Tory backbenches who agree with them and are not afraid to say it.

  
Chief among them is Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, who has done Ms Truss no favours by saying this week that she should call a general election to win a mandate for her policies, and that she was “baffled” at the party’s decision to drop Mr Johnson, “one of the world’s great leaders”.

  
Other Johnsonites include Conor Burns, the trade minister and Nigel Adams, a former Foreign Office minister.

  
Like the Sunakites, there are die-hard Johnsonites who believe that he could be the next prime minister if Ms Truss drops the baton, though no Tory leader has made a comeback since Andrew Bonar Law in 1922.

&amp;#x200B;

**Serial rebels**

All political parties have their fair share of serial rebels. In the Labour Party, it used to be Jeremy Corbyn, before he was elected leader, and the Conservative Party has its own naughty step for those who make a habit of defying the Government.

  
Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defence select committee, has become one of the Government’s most vocal internal critics in recent years. Others, including Sir Roger Gale and Andrew Bridgen, have been among the first to submit letters of no confidence in prime ministers.

  
A total of 91 current Tory MPs did not publicly back Ms Truss, Mr Johnson or Theresa May in the first round of the past three leadership elections, meaning that a significant number of them have never had a leader who was their first choice. The danger for Ms Truss is that they will feel disenfranchised, disillusioned and will do little to prop up her administration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Red Wallers**

  
Largely overlapping with the Northern Research Group, led by party chairman Jake Berry, Tory MPs in former Red Wall Labour seats are among the most jittery about the prospect of a Labour landslide at the next general election.

  
They will be among the toughest to convince that Ms Truss’s proposals to increase benefits in line with wages rather than inflation are the right way forward, and some have spent conference telling glum tales of constituents apologising in advance for not supporting them at the next election “even though you’re a good MP”.

  
Like the Sunakites, some might decide to abstain from key votes, or even oppose them, in order to appease their electorates, in the hope that they might be able to cling onto their seats at the next election by bolstering their credentials as constituency MPs rather than Tory MPs. Some are even said to have held talks with Labour about crossing the floor.

  
**One Nation Tories**

  
One of the most clearly defined factions within the Conservative Party, the One Nation group includes Cabinet ministers Robert Buckland, Chloe Smith and Tom Tugendhat and is chaired by Damian Green, who was Mrs May’s de facto deputy.

  
About 30 MPs and six peers are currently members of the caucus, which represents the moderate, centrist wing of the party and will act as a handbrake on some of the Prime Minister’s more radical policies, such as expanding the Rwanda plan for illegal migrants and deregulating business, agriculture and finance.

  
Like many of the other factions, the group contains MPs who regard themselves as overlooked talent, including the former business secretary Greg Clark, who had hoped to remain in the Cabinet when Ms Truss took over; Matt Hancock, who is still eyeing a ministerial comeback after resigning as health secretary last year; and David Mundell, who had hoped to return to his old job as Scottish secretary under Ms Truss.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1664955878.0,,False,0.0,{},ir4hivx,True,t3_xw434i,True,t1_ir4hivx,False,t3_xw434i,/r/ukpolitics/comments/xw434i/the_conservative_party_has_broken_up_into/ir4hivx/,1667991920.0,26.0,False,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aside from the non-stop gossip about how long Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng will keep their jobs, there is a more troubling question on the lips of delegates at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham: has the party itself now become ungovernable? 

After 12 years in power, the party is so riven with factional divides, so full of disgruntled big beasts and so ill-disciplined that Ms Truss faces very real uncertainty about whether she can get any of her key policies through the House of Commons.

This week conference-goers have barely been able to avoid stumbling into one fringe event or another where the ever-present Michael Gove is openly calling on his colleagues to rebel, like a fox who has legal rights of entry to the henhouse.

He and his backbench acolytes have caused such mayhem that Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng have been forced to abandon their 45p tax cut plan and flip-flop on bringing forward November's spending review as a conference that should have been a victory lap for them turned into humiliation.

Now even Iain Duncan Smith, who ran Ms Truss’s leadership campaign with Therese Coffey, is rebelling against her plans for a real-terms cut in benefit payments.

This is, partly, a Truss problem: she is pursuing policies for which she has no electoral mandate, and therefore MPs do not feel duty-bound to back them.

But if Rishi Sunak had been elected as leader and plumped for a less radical economic policy, it is entirely likely he, too, would have faced serial rebellions from a party that has resolved its Europe problem but has found new ways of falling out with itself.



“The party is much more febrile than under Boris Johnson,” said one Whitehall veteran. “Maybe that’s inevitable after more than a decade in government, but it does feel really cliquey at the moment.”

One of the biggest problems for Ms Truss, or anyone who had won the last leadership contest, is that three different prime ministers in the space of little more than three years has meant a vast churn of ministers and supporters, leaving the backbenches packed with big beasts and others who have tasted - and lost - power.

If they feel overlooked by the current regime, and if they believe their ministerial careers are now over, it is all but impossible to whip them into line. Most of them also believe they could do a better job than their successors, and are not afraid to say it.

Research by the Institute for Government shows that there are currently 119 former ministers on the backbenches, meaning that more than two thirds of all backbench Tory MPs have held a ministerial post.

They include two former prime ministers in Boris Johnson and Theresa May, former chancellors Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid, and other big names including Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Priti Patel, Matt Hancock, Iain Duncan Smith, Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps.

**Party has begun to take power for granted**

All of them are capable of causing huge problems for the Prime Minister, and rallying fellow MPs to their cause. On Tuesday, Ms Patel, the former home secretary, broke her brief post-Cabinet silence to tell a fringe event at the conference that Ms Truss was “spending [money] today with no thought of tomorrow”.

The problem for Ms Truss, as with Mr Johnson and Mrs May, is that she has been thrown straight into the job of Prime Minister at a time when the party has started to take power for granted. In contrast, David Cameron had been party leader in opposition for five years by the time he entered Number 10, meaning he had had time to mould the parliamentary party and went into Government leading a party hungry for power and easily disciplined. It is not difficult to find die-hard Conservatives at the conference who privately say the party now needs a period in opposition to rebuild, reunite and reinvigorate.

A total of 91 current MPs did not back Theresa May, Boris Johnson or Liz Truss as their first choice for Prime Minister, meaning that around a quarter of all current MPs have never had the leader they wanted. The most disgruntled among them are the disaffected Sunakites, including Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Gavin Williamson, who argued throughout the leadership campaign that Ms Truss was promising an unachievable “fairy tale” economic miracle just to get elected, while their man was the honest broker who was punished simply for telling the truth. They remain so bitter about the leadership election that they will feel no compunction about voting against the Government. Some of them are still convinced Mr Sunak will get another chance to lead.



Ms Truss’s natural constituency is the hard Right of the party, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, John Redwood and Steve Baker, but the majority of MPs belong to other formal or informal factions which are already plotting how to pick off the policies they do not like.

There are the Boris mourners, led by former culture secretary Nadine Dorries, Ms Patel and Conor Burns, who remain convinced the party should never have got rid of Mr Johnson, and have little enthusiasm for his successor.

The red wallers, led by Jake Berry, the party chairman, are concerned they will lose their seats if Ms Truss presses ahead with benefit reforms, as are the One Nation Conservatives, including Damian Green, Robert Buckland and Tom Tugendhat, who represent the centre ground and will be a natural handbrake on Ms Truss’s more radical ideas.

There is also a group of serial rebels, including former defence minister Tobias Ellwood, and backbenchers Roger Gale and Andrew Bridgen, and there are more formal factions such as the Blue Collar Conservatives, led by former minister Esther McVey, the Common Sense Group, led by Sir John Hayes, and the Northern Research Group, though there is much overlap between the informal and formal groupings.

Spread throughout all of them are MPs who regard themselves as overlooked talent, such as Grant Shapps, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, all of whom have made their voices heard at conference.



If the party was already difficult to govern, Ms Truss has made it doubly so thanks to the decisions she made in her first few days in power.

“She has not created a unity government,” said one party source. “It was a huge mistake to freeze out everyone who backed Rishi. It’s mad that she hasn’t got someone like Grant [Shapps] in the Cabinet because he is a great communicator. 

“Even Number 10 is very factional. There are people who are in favour and information flows well, but if they are not in favour they get cut out.”

Even with a working majority of 71, Ms Truss is vulnerable to rebellions. Only 36 Tory MPs need to vote with Labour to defeat a government bill, and Mr Shapps, whose ability to predict the outcome of votes is legendary within the party, is now hunched over his spreadsheets, helping to keep track of the size of rebellions. 

It was because Ms Truss had been warned that she did not have the numbers to get her 45p tax cut through the Commons that she was forced to drop it late on Sunday night, and when Parliament returns next Tuesday, she will find out just how governable or otherwise her party really is.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1664903217.0,,False,0.0,{},ir1erzo,True,t3_xvkkrw,True,t1_ir1erzo,True,t3_xvkkrw,/r/ukpolitics/comments/xvkkrw/has_the_tory_party_become_ungovernable_liz_truss/ir1erzo/,1667995238.0,3.0,False,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ITV will use the 2022 Fifa World Cup to launch the replacement for ITV Hub, the streaming platform notorious for infuriating football fans left staring at frozen screens.  
  
Viewers welcomed ITV’s announcement that the Hub, derided for its unwelcome habit of crashing during live events, will be scrapped this autumn.

The commercial broadcaster has invested £160m in replacement on-demand service ITVX, built with a “completely new technical and user-experience architecture.”  
  
New dramas will premiere on ITVX nine months before running on the broadcast ITV channel, and viewers are promised 9,000 hours of content, including 300 blockbuster movies.  
  
Sport will be a key attraction on the new platform. In a risky move, ITV plans to launch ITVX to coincide with the World Cup, which begins on November 20, with a major marketing campaign targeting football fans.  
  
Advertisers have been briefed that the World Cup will be the “perfect introduction” for a service designed to bring casual TV viewers to ITV content and then persuade them to stay.  
  
Its predecessor infuriated viewers with its inability to cope with major live events. During one Euro 2020 football game, the Hub picture froze for nearly 30 minutes.  
  
Love Island fans condemned a “shambles” last year when the Hub crashed, showing an error message, just moments before the series was due to return.

With millions of England and Wales fans set to watch the World Cup on mobile and laptop screens, it’s vital for ITVX’s credibility that it avoids a repeat of those technical failures.

Figures from software company Amdocs found that while most (73 per cent) viewers plan to watch the World Cup on live TV, 44 per cent of millennials and 38 per cent of Gen-Z fans plan to stream games.  
  
ITV will show England’s group game against the USA and will have picks one and two of the round of 16 and first pick of the quarter-final stages. ITV is also showing Wales’ group match with the USA and clashes featuring Brazil, France, Argentina, Spain and the Netherlands.  
  
Dame Carolyn McCall, the ITV chief executive, promised a “simplified and seamless experience” compared to the Hub and executives are confident that “it’ll be alright on the night.” Kelly Williams, commercial managing director at ITV, said: “People will come in and think: ‘This is a better and stronger service proposition.’”  
  
The World Cup will be accompanied by 20 themed pop-up FAST channels, offering instant highlights, interviews and additional content.  
  
Rhys McLachlan, ITV’s director of advanced advertising, told media website The Drum: “It’s not a lipstick-on-a-pig, ITV Hub 2.0 job – it’s a proper transformative experience. It’s like going from a Nokia brick to an iPhone.”  
  
“We are going to come from being average in the field to leagues ahead – it’s going to be way better than \[BBC\] iPlayer,” he predicted.

Aimed at a mass audience, ITVX will be free-to-view, with adverts surrounding programmes. There will also be a subscription tier, with a monthly fee yet to be announced, which will offer advert-free viewing and an additional 6,000 hours of content.  
  
Bosses want ITVX to become a portal for live viewing, rather than a catch-up service. It will be the home of Big Brother, when ITV brings back the “original” reality show next year in a bid to reach a younger audience.  
  
“Our goal with ITVX is that it becomes, in its own right, a place you go to look for programmes,” said Deep Bagchee, chief product officer, ITV.  
  
He told a media conference: “Our goal is to double our monthly active users to 20 million; to double the number of streaming hours on our streaming services to 2 billion; and double subscribers over the next five years.”  
  
However, ITVX is launching into a saturated streaming market with new platforms including Discovery+ and Paramount+ battling for viewers with the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Apple TV.  
  
Netflix will launch a cheaper ad-supported tier for its streaming platform next month as the company tries to stem the loss of over one million subscribers in 2022. Disney will follow suit in December.  
  
Kevin Lygo, ITV’s managing director of media and entertainment, said ITVX’s advantage would be that “it is free, and as we head into difficult times that’s going to be a compelling reason to watch it”.  
  
ITVX will have exclusive premieres this autumn, including Kim Philby drama A Spy Among Friends, starring Damian Lewis and Guy Pearce. In Litvinenko, David Tennant plays the lead role of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian Federal Security Services and KGB officer who was murdered in November 2006 by polonium poisoning, creating a security and diplomatic crisis.  
  
ITVX also boasts a “Rosetta Stone” in consumer data gleaned from the broadcaster’s 35 million registered users.  
  
Adverts will be personalised, with viewers’ gender, date of birth and postcode matched with content consumption and social media usage harvested from consumer data firm, Experian.  
  
Niall Sloane, ITV sport director, said: “The World Cup is now in focus and we’re delighted to be able to bring viewers coverage of what promises to be some of the standout games of the tournament across ITV channels and our new free streaming service ITVX, which launches this autumn.”

He spent days searching for an affordable lighting system and a proper table to fit the corpse on for proper display on camera. The table that just arrived cost so much, Damian thought, that success today was imperative, and key to that is active engagement. Things have changed since the last course he gave, six months ago. He was new, and the market competition is fierce. And this time, he took the time to properly research and test the the needed material.*

*Doug gave the camera's battery one last glance, before focusing on the screen, where the counter showed around eighty people waiting for the standby screen to fade into black and,*

*""Welcome everyone, to the Intro to Rapid Biological Revitalization course! Known in many forums and online communities as Necromancy 101,"" The viewers watched a young, charming-looking man in his twenties, wearing a lab coat, and sitting on a desk with a heap of paper, and shelves full of strange-looking books in the background. And next to him was a lying male body, which, if you purchased the premium bundle with full HD video quality, may appear to you having slight mold on different parts of skin.*

*Damian was careful to gently regulate his breathing as the tutorials showed. ""Now, you should be able to see the different certifications on the top left of your screen. These were awarded from the top platforms in the business, as well as respected universities that support our work, so I am truly glad that you all managed to get the 20% discount for the entire course! Now as written in the email, the body must be in the direction of the sun depending on your personal location. Viewers watching in nighttime will unfortunately have to wait for daylight, as direct exposure to vitamin D is essential for our work,"" Damian managed to maintain his confident voice as he brought up a reference book in front of him ""but don't worry, the session will be recorded and sent to you all tonight.""*

*He began by explaining some of the theory that will be used in this course, then proceeded to ask the viewers to start rubbing various joints of the bodies to facilitate the next steps. As the clock ticked on, he went on to perform certain movements on the corpse he brought, rubbing him with water and salt, and placing a peculiar stone and some powder in his mouth, before quickly redirecting the camera to himself.*

*""Now,"" a sweaty Damian explained ""with correct execution, the effects should have already started within the body thirty minutes ago,"" he gazed at the man leaving the room, before returning his eyes to the camera ""They should appear physically now, but pay attention because the symptoms are classified into three types. Firstly, the body may show aggressive physical movement for a few seconds, so do be careful around the body at this time."" He looked at the paper in front of him, ""The second type is speech: Some of you may find the deceased not moving at all but muttering something, it could be just blabber, but remember: The mind regains control of the body gradually. Excuse me,"" He forced himself to look away for a moment, struggling to contain his gasps, before stumbling upon a piece of paper on the desk with ""remember to breathe"" written on it.*

*Damian managed to bring his face back to the camera: ""And the third type of symptoms, which is the most common today, is a slight movement of a limb. It may be quick so pay close attention to the body – You don't wanna miss it!"" He eagerly went on ""Next time will be the last session where we will use all the knowledge and preparation done in this session to finally bring back the body to life. If anyone has any questions, feel free to jump aboard on the chat at your bottom right.*

*""His eyes kept switching between the blank chat and the camera: ""I see some of you have experienced the speech symptom. Madison asks if the body can hear speech as well - Not yet, but certainly in the next session!""*

*Moments passed heavily, before the text started flooding in:*

Sorry to hear you're having this issue with Superblend. I'm actually the CEO at Form so thought I'd reach out.

As you say I think you chose well (!) but clearly something isn't agreeing with you. As others have mentioned there are a number of vegetable and fruit powders in there - one of which might not agree with you.

Also some (very few) people are sensitive to pea protein - do you know if you've had pea protein before without issue?

A few people mention thickeners/emulsifiers - we don't use them at all, we spent a long time developing the formulation to use grades and blends that make them unnecessary.

I would suggest trying our Performance Protein - this is actually higher protein per serving (30g) but without all the added greens and fruit powders etc. It might help narrow down for you what you might be sensitive to.

If you'd like to get in touch with customer service on [hello@formnutrition.com](mailto:hello@formnutrition.com) and let them know Superblend is not agreeing with you they'll be happy to send a bag of Performance to see if that agrees better with you. Say you spoke to Damian!

Finally also make sure you're mixing it with something good, eg a very clean nut milk or just water. 

Ease on the stomach, lack of bloating is one of the key things our customers choose us for - so it would be great to help and get you sorted on this also.

And I would argue that it's disingenuous to just leave the conversation at just 'role players' because it pits Jimmy against both Lebron and AD.  It's a 2 on 1.

&gt;  It's not to say that Butler is expected to be better than Lebron and AD together. It's that the strength of the heat was their depth vs. the strength of the lakers was their star power. You won't be able to make direct comparisons because both teams chose to allocate their cap space in different ways and made very different teams. The overarching point is that people seem to have the idea that has moreorless carried the Heat during his tenure, when his team was more like the 00s Knicks (a very deep team with a clear leader, but succeeded based on significant contributions throughout the roster) than the AI 76ers (a team the leaned heavily on the offensive strength of a singular player). So again to be clear, it's not to say that Butler failed because he couldn't match Lebron and AD's impact, it's more to make the common sense argument: yea the Heat had the deeper team and the Lakers had the better star power, obviously the Heat failed once their depth faltered (due to injury in the finals).

Don't one of AD/Lebron also contribute to the Lakers' depth?  

I wouldn't say Jimmy carried them *to* the finals, but he definitely carried them *in* the finals.  

If the Heat were so deep, why did they only get the 5th seed in the regular season?  They were literally one game ahead of the Sixers.  They had an SRS of 2.59.  

Depth *shines* in the regular season.  It seems incongruent to call them a deep team.

&gt;  That's my fault again, I was looking at his rebounds in the WCSF, skimmed across too quickly.

Alright I forgive you.

&gt;  The video explains a change in their defensive strategy, but it's not like AD wasn't playing and then he was playing.

So what's the implication here?  The Lakers did better but it didn't manifest into starkly different tangible results because of sample size?

&gt;  AD was the anchor for the Lakers elite defense, which was what made the team fairly elite. So him changing the series would show up on and off the court, where he led the lakers in defensive rating. You'd have to go into the specific finals line ups to get better data on the defense without him on the court.

And where do we find these stats?  The video doesn't bring them up.  

&gt;  Correct. Butler's luxury was all time depth which faltered in the finals when key contributors got injured and so the Heat failed

An ""all time depth"" team is the 73-win Warriors, or the 72 win Bulls.  The Heat won 44 games in the regular season, let's pump the breaks lmao.

&gt;  As a reminder, the original point you're responding to about Butler's help compared to Damian Lillard's

I know, but the point I specifically took issue with was how both Lebron AND AD were better than Jimmy in the finals.  

&gt;   I agree it's harder to win a championship on depth because you really need everyone to stay healthy (2004 Pistons; 2010 Mavericks) but Butler statistically had the type of statistical contribution form his supporting cast that had historically won championships until they got hurt.

To be clear, I don't think those two were bad but I think the cumulative impact of the Heat role players was better than the cumulative impact of the Laker's role players

&gt;Also I think it's unfair to lump the super star duo of Lebron and AD together and pit them against Butler when comparing the rest of their cast. 

It's not to say that Butler is expected to be better than Lebron and AD together. It's that the strength of the heat was their depth vs. the strength of the lakers was their star power. You won't be able to make direct comparisons because both teams chose to allocate their cap space in different ways and made very different teams.

&gt;Ok bro at this point I think we're getting our stats from two different sources lmao. Where are you getting 4 rebounds from? I'm showing a 2.4 difference per game. In fact, Jimmy and AD were pretty damn close in offensive rebound %!

That's my fault again, I was looking at his rebounds in the WCSF, skimmed across too quickly.

&gt;Source? Not trying to sound like a jerk but you've have stats incorrect twice now, so I'd like a link.

Throw in playoffs, 2019-2020 and sort by Defensive RAPTOR

&gt;Did it? The Lakers were 2-1 in the series before the 'strategy' and went 2-1 afterward.

The video explains a change in their defensive strategy, but it's not like AD wasn't playing and then he was playing. AD was the anchor for the Lakers elite defense, which was what made the team fairly elite. So him changing the series would show up on and off the court, where he led the lakers in defensive rating. You'd have to go into the specific finals line ups to get better data on the defense without him on the court. A quick assessment, might be Dwight who came in for him at times, and the team defensive rating with Dwight at center was 117 (with AD, it was at 108).

&gt;And he benefited greatly with playing with the literal 2nd greatest player of all time.

I use one red(x10)-1h on 25mineshaft because this was first time when i was problem to max shaft to 800 so i decide to use bonus to make this faster. And i make 800 lvl and i have more then 4h barrier time to end so probably i was able to make this without this red(x10) income bonus. But i need to make dinner and other thing so i was better for me to make this a little bit faster. After last barier i use Blue(x2), Red(x10),Green(x5),Grey(x20) And two Times Purple(x50). And this was enough to finish. I dont remember how many this bonus i use. All on 1h so probably 2 or 3 something like this.

2-Dangerous Shores Mine-Time 10:14  
Like before from start only blue(x2)bonus. This time game was a little bit harder because with this bonus i get 702lvl before barier after 15 mine shaft ends.  
At shaft 20 i get to 756 before barier ends.  
At shaft 25 i use first red(x10) bonus from start. And i need to use another one and few red(x10) -5m and green(x5 )-5m to make 25 shaft on 800lvl.  
After last barier ends i use at start 4x green(x5), red(x10),grey(x20) on 1h. and i few Purple(x50) to add some bonus when i have Turner and Blinsley.  
When i finish mine i have 35 bonus income left. So 30 shaft take 3,5H to make.  
On this mine there was less ecutive managers for uprgrade cost reduction.

3-Impossible Shores -Time 10:34  
I start with 10 blue(x2). This mine was a lot harder. Before every barier i stuck on 702-740 shaft lvl. On shaft 25 i use two extra 1h green(x5) and red(x10) and after this few 5m same colors to extra 45m bonus income time. Mainly because i was tired three days in row on impossible mines and i needed few hours break from playing on last barier. I make this 800lvl on 25 shaft and i have break.

When last barier ends i put 2 green(x5), grey(x20), red(x10) 1h bonus income and 3x Purple(x50) on 15 min. After this i use a lot of instant cash for quick bonus. When this 2h bonus time  was near to end i put  more instant cash to finish mine. And i make this 30lvl in less then 2h time with this. At the end i have 10m left.

Summary:

I dont remember how many this income  boost i use but probably something like this:

33 blue(x2) on 1h  
6-7 grey(x20) on 1h  
6-8 green(x5) on 1h  
10-12 red(x10) on 1h  
6-8 purple(x50) on 5m  
30-40 red() on 5m  
20-30 green(x5) on 5m  
80-90 instant cash on 30m

Zero supercash

Main problem with this mines was barier time. I use bonus from Investor Earpice, Limitless Drive -8% Barrier Time and -4% Barrier Time. When you use super cash and more income bonuses you should make this quicker. I wait probably too long but im happy with results.

Maybe this help some1 decide when start this impossible

JIFF regulation is that each team must field an average of 16 players per game who have resided in France for 3 years at least, or are not an international of another nation across a full season. 

So basically the 23 has to have 16 French players across the year as an average. But since you need squad rotation, and each team's best players are all different, and it's a season average, you end up with different teams having different permutations. So some might field a lot of youth players away to an opponent deemed really strong or weak, maybe more than 16, because they don't have a lot of good French players and they have a lot of good non-French players. Pumping up their JIFF average to enable their best team to play the most important matches of their season. 


Racing's issue is they have lost Vakatawa and signed Sailli to replace him. Means they're down 1 JIFF qualified player than before. I reckon they're already riding the JIFF qualification as close as they dare, Woki will have helped, but so many of their core players and key men are not French. Nyakane, Russell, Imhoff, Jones, Bresler, the two Georgian props, Gelant now in on a big contract, as is Regan Grace the Welsh speedster. Then the Fijians Kamikamica, Tuivaka, Narisia, Volavola and the Tongan Poloniati. To make JIFF they're probably already working out the permutations and deciding which youngsters need to play more etc. 

The other thing is Penaud will likely become available, so Wade could easily be a 1 yr deal to get Damian in, who is JIFF qualified and top class anyway. Duhan you'd be bringing in on a longer term deal I think at his price range. Wade is cheaper, older, been out for a few years now in the NFL, and ultimately, may be using this year just to market himself for a Prem deal and move back to England.

- being saddled with 5 years of Kenny Thomas $10m cap hit.   he scored 1536 in 5 seasons, half coming in 05-06 when he started all 82 on what seemed like a pretty good team. 
- drafting Quincy Douby 2 spots ahead of Rajon Rondo and 5 spots ahead of Kyle Lowry.  Maybe none of this ever happens if they drafted the heir to Bibby in that draft, but they missed like a lot of teams.  
- firing Rick Adelman. I mean, all the guy did was never have a losing season in 8 years with the team.  The series of coaches that rolled through from Eric Musselman, to Reggie Theus, to Paul Westphal (3yrs!) to Keith Smart  could have ended up in the middle of the road with even above average talent on the roster.

With Kemba walker, Brandon Knight, klay Thompson, and Kawhi Leonard there, it looked like a cant miss spot, but the kings opted for Jimmer in a move that pleased wipipo in the greater Sacramento area, but set the team back years.  Imagine Walker and Cousins on the same team (the most likely scenario on that board at the time).  Might have even made Paul Westphal look good.
- draft Thomas Robinson 1 spot ahead of Damian Lillard. Welp.
-draft Ben Maclemore with the following 8 on the board: KCP, Trey Burke, CJ Mccollum, Michel Carter Williams, Steven Adams, Kelly Olynyk, Shabazz Mohammad, and Giannis.  For the second year in a row they draft a guy tumbling down the board. 
- firing Mike Malone.  Best coach they had in years. They gave him one season and booted him after an 11-13 start with one of the worst rosters they had seen in the while stretch.  
- pick swap w the 76ers led to Fox instead of Tatum.  Not the worst, but Tatum looks like hes on a star trajectory. Same trade left them without a 2019 pick.

Neither Loid nor Yor will create that possibility to succeed a plan in the end. Otherwise most of this series wouldn't make sense if Anya is not the key to everything. Anya randomly getting stars or (I assume) Damian getting some interesting character do make the main plot progess. It's some small steps (though some chapters are complete comic relief of course) but it does seem to progress.

Well, as a massive supporter of PFF, I've listed numerous indicators that have been shown to be particularly strong with predicting outcomes for players. You... haven't. PFF information is part of the puzzle. I would point out that PFF's own lead draft analyst doesn't rank Dameon Pierce within 40 spots on his big board of KW3 and Hall, and has also stated that he believes SEVERAL back in next year's class are greatly superior to the highest ranked players in this class. 

So PFF, about the highest reputable source I've seen on Pierce, ranked him as the #95 Prospect in the country. 

&gt;Injuries are also irrelevant beyond the fact that nobody is a guranteed long term product.

That isn't the point. You were making a false argument that his value only has one way to go. 

&gt;Treylon Burks isnt definitely going to be a better player than Dameon Pierce in 5 years.

Ja'Marr Chase isn't 'definitely' going to be a WR1 next year even with health. We bet on it because of past information and indicators.

Because Elijah Moore has had very good games as a rookie and might be the #1 target on his team.

1. your wrist should snap a little more on the release for more consistent follow through- seems like your wrist doesnt fully follow through leaving it in almost a fist on sideways/down, instead of fingers alligned down with the hoop.
2. i'd try to keep both feet parallel and square (not necessarily together/in line)
3. elbow should be a bit more locked on the transition into the release. could be fixed by bringing the ball closer to your face.
4. the forearm doesnt have a strong upward 90 degree angle so it looks like your pushing it a bit, making it easier to block.
5. how does this jumpshot look off the dribble?

overall your jumper has a solid base. kind of reminds me of a hybrid between Damian Lillard/Anfernee Simons with the flat forearm. a few tweaks (in my opinion) and it'll look close to textbook.

1988 NYC. A Chelsea loft showing on a rainy day. Downtown It Girl Mitsu finds herself sparring with bad-boy Wall Street trader Damian over who’s going to buy it...and fighting the overwhelming urge to kiss that arrogant smirk right off his gorgeous mouth. In his bed and arms, the banked embers of her heart catch to flame. Through caffeine-buzzed days and neon-lit nights, the young lovers spin dreams of building their empire together—she’ll be the cultural icon and muse, and he’ll be the finance titan.

Then Damian puts money over their relationship and shows Mitsu how ruthless and dangerous he can be. Wounded and reeling, Mitsu responds by cutting him out of her life…no matter what it means for her future.

Decades later, they’re both guests to the same destination wedding on a tiny, remote island. There’s no escape from each other…and their shared past.

If Anya either doesn't do well or simply refuses to go to school, then Loid will lose his only access to Donovan and stopping the war. To me, that's why we see a lot of Anya's life; to see how she's doing and think about how it'll affect the mission.

&gt;!However, considering the fateful meeting between Yor and Donovan's wife in the manga, Anya's role seems to have diminished. Even though Melinda initially wasn't considered to have been worth investigating, Yor's interaction might change everything. That might be why we're seeing Loid at the hospital now.

You were trying to paint criticism of Jace as something unique. It isn't.

That's the OP and some other commentor's effort, I was strictly about Dick &amp; JPV.  
Becuase I think they weren't poorly received &amp; they genuinely had a shot at becoming Batmn. I think initial backlash for a passing of the torch is inevitable, Kyle fans werent keen on Hal &amp; vice versa, but it is not necessarily an indicator of the end of the title, the key factors imo are time &amp; the previous incarnation being off the board.   
I think JPV had a shot of fans being convinced, on account of just that period of time in the 90s when he took over, Death of Superman  being midway through, Hal Jordan shortly a few months after going Parallax, Wonder Woman had something I don't remember, but Artemis was Wonder Woman for a bit. And Bruce got his back broken.   
Dick in Prodigal was not a correct start on account of the fact that you knew from the start it was a short term situation, Bruce was gonna prepare and come back and he had only shortly returned to stop JPV. Dick &amp; Damian in Morrison's run was a better shot since Bruce was adrift in time, Morrison could have taken their own time to return him to present day. Morrison once said, they could have written Dick-Damian stories for 10 years and that might've been interesting to see. Dick also being the sidekick &amp; as old of a character as Bruce is also something that is a plus in this occasion.   


I do think that Batman's mythos is as you say about one man's creation of a nightmare, but I think that the decision include a Robin in his mythos indicates his own hopes to grow beyond that, and it would be interesting to see if someone had a clear vision and the green light to just go see what that might be.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1661401325.0,,False,0.0,{},iloy6z3,False,t3_wvszo2,False,t1_iloy6z3,True,t1_ilo57cf,/r/DCcomics/comments/wvszo2/who_or_what_is_overhated_by_dc_fans/iloy6z3/,1662613052.0,1.0,False,True,False,DCcomics,t5_2qlmm,r/DCcomics,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;As far as I can tell, I have no information about Alexandar other than he's an asshole.

Alexandar is Lucian's last living son, and was head of the Divine Order until his ""death"" at the end of Act 1. He's godwoken like you, and is competing with you to ascend. People look up to Alexandar, and everyone expects him to fill his father's massive shoes, so he does what he does out of a sense of obligation instead of malice. He feels that he NEEDS to ascend and solve all of Rivellon's problems. If you let him live, there's a persuasion check down the line where you can get him to admit that he doesn't actually want to be the divine, and will support your bid to ascend. He temporarily joins your party afterward. 


&gt;Alexandar is the key to understanding all

The source lake and the academy are locked up, and you don't start out knowing how to get inside. There are multiple ways to find out, and one of them is to help Alexandar, so he tells you in exchange. 


&gt;He isn't Damian

Damian was Lucian's other son, and a very prominent antagonist in one of the older Divinity games. Unlike Alexandar, he was genuinely villainous, and died for it. 


&gt;Now this guy wants me to forget his assasination attempts and just kill what seems to be my destined soulmate (not that I can't enjoy some elven action on the side you know), because... reasons?

As multiple NPCs explain to you during the prince's storyline, lizards are directly descended from dragons. When you first find out in Act 2, all you're told is that somehow lizards eventually devolved into what they are now, but if the Red Prince and Red Princess have children, those children will be born dragons instead of lizards. What the Shadow Prince reveals to you in Act 3 is that the other races grew fearful of the dragons, and banded together to kill them en masse until eventually there were very few left. The survivors devolved into lizards after spending too much time in hiding. The SP is concerned that if Red Prince and Sadha birth new dragons, it'll happen again and result in mass lizard genocide, so he begs you to kill her instead. The reason he tries to actually talk to you is that at this point he's tried and failed to kill you NUMEROUS times, and has basically given up. Reasoning with you is his last-ditch effort. 


&gt;So this is the ancient academy of the Eternals"". What? Is it? How do I know that? Was I looking for that? Wasn't I looking for the fountain to become Divine?

If I was given the keys to the DCEU Kingdom, I would have introduced Tim Drake as the new Robin in a solo Batfleck movie. Batfleck in BvS actually has a a lot of similarities with Batman in the comics just after Jason died. That Batman had become more violent and unhinged in the wake of Jason's death. Tim brought light back into Bruce's life and helped stabilize him once more. 

I would also have Dick Grayson already be Nightwing. Say him and Bruce had falling out and he left to do his own thing as a solo vigilante. Like the comics, I would have Tim figure out Dick's identity which leads directly to Bruce by proxy. 

I would also have the dead Robin be Jason. Why Zack Snyder insisted on Dick being the dead Robin is something I will go to grave never understanding. That makes no sense when you already have an entire lore around Jason being the dead Robin.

[],False,,ACuriousBagel,1519653209.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_7zaoed,False,False,"&gt;For some reason I get a persuasion check to tell Gareth not to kill him? Why? I don't have that part of the game in front of me, but one of my lines said something like ""Alexandar is the key to understanding all"". What? Why?

I don't remember the line about being the key to understanding all, but it might be because Alexander knows how to access the area where you can ascend to the divine.

I always interpreted the persuasion check as being for Gareth's benefit rather than Alexander's, or at least as an option to not go scorched earth.

&gt;He isn't Damian"". Again, what? I've barely heard that name the entire game

Damian was a major character in the original game, *Divine Divinity*. I haven't played it myself, but I gather that Gareth (and Ifan)'s backstories tie in heavily to events in that game. He's being brought up because, like Alexander, he is son of Lucian the Divine - and he was a villain that Gareth may be projecting onto Alexander. 

You don't have to dissuade Gareth from killing Alexander. The option is there if you would like to have a response to conflict that isn't ""kill them all"" (or maybe you want to kill him yourself, or maybe you want to offer him up to Ifan, knowing what that means to him).

&gt;this guy wants me to forget his assasination attempts and just kill what seems to be my destined soulmate, because... reasons?

I found his reasoning compelling, to the point I wasn't sure how to proceed. 

&gt;basically, every villain's ""reasons"" are ""you don't get it, I'm doing bad things but they're for the greater good"".

Generally, the villains are trying to manipulate you to do their bidding. How much they believe what they're saying is open to interpretation. Personally though, I much prefer my villains to have believable motivations and **not** be childish cartoon villains. The deconstruction of this genre of storytelling, moral ambiguity and complex characters is part of why I love DOS2 (and Chris Avellone's writing in general). If you prefer your storytelling to be more black and white, this may not be the game for you.

&gt;I imagined some conflict might've arisen around that issue; a persuasion chack seems a bit lame

I've never not made the persuasion check, but I think the conflict happens if you don't succeed. It may also work differently if you're playing co-op.

&gt;""So this is the ancient academy of the Eternals"". What? Is it? How do I know that?

I can't remember what clues you get about this, other than those that come from Fane. There's a lot of story context that Fane delivers if he's in your party. All of the characters have lore/context that you'll miss out on from not having them with you, but Fane's in particular is tied to &gt;!The Eternals, the Voidwoken, The Seven,!&lt; and the world itself.

&gt;by now I feel like I should have a better idea...

In his bed and arms, the banked embers of her heart catch to flame. Through caffeine-buzz days and neon-lit nights, they spin dreams of building their empire together; she’ll be the cultural icon and muse; he’ll be the finance titan.

Then Damian puts money over their relationship and shows Mitsu how ruthless and dangerous he can be. Wounded and reeling, Mitsu responds by cutting him out of her life…no matter what it means for her future.

**Sometimes the second time’s the charm**.

**Present Day**:
Decades later, they’re both guests to a destination wedding on a tiny, remote island. There’s no escape from each other…and their shared past.

He smiled as he pulled a slice of pizza from the box sitting beside him. 

""The souls are pouring in today."" He announced to no one in particular. On the screens in front of him, hundreds of humans shuffled along the gleaming halls, with no clear destination in sight. Some seemed oblivious, some huddled together in groups, and others passed blithely through any one of a hundred different doorways. The high ceilings and multiple levels seemed to create an optical illusion, stacking one scene of aimless misery atop another.

Damian clicked a button and all at once the main screen showed a different scene: souls lined up for the reckoning, their faces plastered with a weary resignation. Damian grinned, there were a lot of them today; hollowed-out husks of humans, choosing their fates in a twisted circus of torture. For a moment he felt a pang of empathy, a flash of sorrow for all those tired souls down there.  *No,* he thought, *they wanted this, they* asked *for this.* His eyes narrowed slightly as he watched. 

In the cool, dimly lit room, the glow of the screens cast their ghostly light on Damian's face. His eyes took in a silent panorama of hidden knowledge, playing out across multiple angles, and always with the same ultimate end: reckoning. Even then, it was never over. Damian noticed the same souls kept cycling through, day after day, hour after hour after hour. A hellish cycle from which they would never break. Damian yawned. 

He turned, suddenly curious. A laptop sat on the side of the table, the newest model, provided by the big guy upstairs. *Whatever it takes to keep us happy, I guess.* Damian thought to himself as he sedately tapped on the keys. After a bit of searching he found it: attendance was up 47 percent. 

""Man, this world really is going to hell in a handbasket."" Damian once again declared to no one in particular.

""Good for us. Job security, right?"" Lucy quipped as she slipped in the door. 

""I guess, but why do they keep doing this to themselves? I mean, yeah, I'll watch, but damn."" Damian said as he offered the pizza box. Lucy's eyes lit up as she took a piece and pulled another black leather chair up to the ghostly blue glow of trapped souls. Lucy settled in as she took a bite and motioned to the live feed in front of them. 

""They don't know any better,"" she said with a mouthful of pizza. Lucy swallowed and smiled, ""they made their choices, this is their life now.""

""Yeah, I guess."" Damian sighed. He rubbed his eyes as Lucy pressed another button. ""Fucking ghouls.""

Suddenly something on Damian's shoulder caught Lucy's eye. 

""Uh Damian, you need to get your shit fixed up there, if the big guy sees that it'll be hell to pay on all of us."" Damian looked down at where Lucy was pointing. The patch on his uniform was frayed, and the colors were faded. Lucy pointed at her own shoulder, the patch there was clean and bright. ""This is what's expected of Twin Pines Mall Security staff. You need to be setting an example."" Damian looked at her for a moment before they both burst into laughter, falling back into their chairs and tittering uncontrollably. 

""Oh shit, that was good, you had me going there for a second,"" Damian giggled ""there's definitely a special place in hell for you, Lucy.""

Lucy nodded and motioned at the room.

16- He and the ""Fab 5"" create the Teen Titans, is still Batman's partner though.

18- Goes to College Pre-Law. Teen Titans have disbanded for ""reasons"". Batman and Robin's partnership is still strong.

21- The Titans are formed due to larger criminal threats and organizations all over the world.  Titans are a serious Hero organization and are well respected, not some loosey Teen club like the Teen Titans were. But they still see each other as family.

Dick and Bruce break their partnership due to Bruce not liking how Dick is splitting time between protecting Gotham and leading the Titans.

22- Dick becomes Nightwing after Bruce makes Jason Robin. Public never knows that Nightwing was originally Robin the Boy Wonder. Wears the blue and gold costume. Most in the Superhero and Supervillain community do not know that he was Robin either outside of the Titans.

Titans first encounter Slade Wilson, Deathstroke the Terminator, 

25- Graduates Law School, passes the Bar. Titans have become one of the greatest superhero teams, rivaling the Justice League.

26- Titans disband due to ""reasons"". Dick moves to Bludhaven. This is his first time alone. Fights crime as Nightwing and builds a name for himself as a solo hero/crimefighter. Changes Nightwing costume to Black and Blue. Cleans up most of the organized crime during his time there. Also builds a successful career as an Attorney.

28- Deathstroke tries to blow up Bludhaven, Nightwing stops him and Bludhaven is not destroyed. Bruce and Dick reconcile.

I think from a play style standpoint that Bones could be a discount version of Damian Lillard.

With AG though idk. I'm not going to discount any shooting progress he made this year since he backed it up with his best FT shooting and most confident midrange shooting of his career. I think he shot surprisingly well on above-the-break 3s this year moreso than corners, but that would kinda support what you're saying since ATB 3s are worse on average than corner 3s.

I just have a hard time not looking at Gordon's off-ball low post game when Jokic is on the floor and not seeing anything other than mismatches. AG only really struggles inside against bigger, heavier defenders with length. If you match AG up with equal size AG will win inside. Problem is, how many teams can put size on AG while also putting size on Jokic and maybe even MPJ.

I think everything AG did off ball to set himself up to get the ball under the basket this year is 100% replicable even with Jokic + Murray actions taking place at the top of the key. If he's got an open dunk set up, both Jokic and Murray will find him.

Damian, the circus master.

Lore: he owns a circus but he himself works in there, doing all sorts of stunts for the audience. Then something... bad happened and now he is fighting in the summoners rift.

Passive - They love me!: every time he lands an ability on an enemy they hear a loud applause and cheer for Damian for 2 seconds. Every ability landed increases the volume of applause and cheer by 0.5 decibels. It scales infinitely until the applause is literally the only thing the enemy can hear when he gets hit.  The sound of this ability is coded apart from voice lines and effects so it cannot be silenced in settings. Only counter is take off headphones or turn off speakers. Also, while an enemy is listening to this cheer the dmg they do to Damian is reduced by 20%

Q - Cartwheel: Damian does a cartwheel moving in the direction of the cursor. It goes through minions and monsters doing dmg to them, the cartwheel keeps going on for up to 3 seconds but colliding with a champion stops the cartwheel and does bonus damage in area. 

W - Harness flight: Damian summon a harness and rope which suspends him in the air for 3 seconds and gives extra move speed, pass over terrain and dodge ground based attacks (Maphite Q, ChoGat Q, Talia minefield, etc) 

E - Target practice: Damian starts juggling 10 knives in the air, this can be channeled for up to 10 seconds. The longer the channel the more dmg each knife does. During this channeling he loses 10% move speed and cannot use another ability until he uses all the knives. Once you press the key again he shoots the 10 knives in the direction of the cursor at a speed of about 3 knifes per second. If he channeled the ability the whole 10 seconds upon firing the 10th knife he shoots another 12 knives simultaneously around him in each direction of the clock.

R - Animal tamer: Damian will summon 3 circus animals to use as projectiles which can be aimed at a small area where they land with big impact doing AOE dmg. The first key press will load the animal onto his back, the second key press will fling the animal in the direction of the cursor.  After this impact they remain on the field for 5 seconds but each one does something different.   

First a lion, this one scales off AD damage, after the AOE burst he will seek the closest champion to bite him, if several champions are near he will choose the one with lowest HP.  

Next a bear, this one scales off AP dmg. After AOE dmg he will seek the nearest enemy champion to go hug them, immobilizing them for 2 seconds. If several champions are near he will chose the one with lowest magic resist.

Lastly an elephant, this one scales off adaptive dmg and after reaching the area and doing its AOE dmg it will keep rolling until it collides with terrain. Neutral units and enemy units including turrets and nexus will take dmg from being hit by it before it is stopped by terrain.

The ""Lean Dog"" is what the military used to look for at the time of Bond's conception. (At least that's what the French call it. Le Chien Maigre).

Get rid of much of the fat but don't build too much muscle. You want to be lean and effective.
To get there, you have to run a lot, do sensible body weight training and then run some more.

The fat surplus is what is going to disappear first and then the rest should follow.

Long distance running means you are actually training for endurance. Because that's the key, you have to be able to go for a long time. Running for a long time is going to make you burn the fat you don't need and train your body to be able to go for a long period of time. Not only if you need to run but also if you need to stay awake, lift another man, hold heavy weaponry and so on.

A good way to train that is the Obstacle Course. That's when you'll have to mobilize your muscle in the best way. During an obstacle course, the only thing you lift is yourself, the only thing you move is your body. It helps coordinatation and it makes your work on the important parts. Legs, arms, shoulder and core. But not in an excessive way. 


The last thing would be Hand to hand combat. That helps build the right physique in the military and it's a good way to get some more cardio in. In the 60s that would have been some mix of judo and wrestling, nowadays Krav Maga is the most well known martial art used in the military but not the only one.

I feel like Bond being a military man and being part of a government agency, this would be his workout routine. The most effective one for a soldier, which he is at the core. 

In this training regiment, eating is almost not a factor. The stress you put on your body is enough to get you lean. What the army want you to eat are slow acting sugars and energy boosting food. Nothing is aimed at your physique but only at your energy level. 

Brosnan is a good exemple of what Bond would look like I feel. Lazenby too. 
Dalton has IMO almost the perfect physique.

**Shaft Behind** is when the Total Transportation rate of your elevator / warehouse is significantly higher than any of your mineshafts.

As a result, in this situation, your elevator and warehouse SMs will be able to produce significantly more income than any of your mineshaft SMs.

One key difference is that your mineshaft SMs can run independently, without the need to stockpile resources, as they draw income directly from the mineshaft.

Elevator and Warehouse SMs require you to stockpile resources - using SMs like Sue, Chester / Gordon and Wolfgang to stockpile in the crate for elevator SMs to draw on, and Lee or Damian to move that stockpile up to the elevator for warehouse SMs to draw on - in order to generate income. If there's nothing stockpiled, there's nothing for them to draw on when they're active, and they makes no income.

Dear Patrick,

Friday night falls over Tulane. The bald cypresses sway in the zephyrs coming in off the coast, casting longer shadows than the students who traverse Newcomb quad. They move in electric little groups, primed for a wild night. They’ve formed friendships in the plush beanbag chairs of the e-sports club, in the moonlit tents of the outdoor adventures club, in the lively editorial room of the Hullabaloo. They’ll cement them in the hedonistic dance halls of the Big Easy, swaying to triggaman beats and sipping silky smooth hurricanes. On this holy Friday on St. Charles Street, they’re dressed for the occasion. They’ve swapped their tees and sneakers, for satin dresses and button downs, stilettos, and topsiders. 

They could stop in at a get-together hosted by one of Tulane’s 24 fraternities and sororities, perhaps a round of rage cage at Kap Sig or 90s night with A Chi O. They could belt out Karaoke at the Cat’s Meow on Bourbon Street before sauntering down to Canal Street and the Masquerade Nightclub, to cut a rug under a 50 foot night sky ceiling. Tulane’s party culture is built on camaraderie, relaxation, and a thirst for good times. Magnify that by the larger than life scale of New Orleans, and you start to get a sense of what life here is like.

I won’t lie to you; you’re going to run into some NBL alums at these parties. Tevin Lewis, Jheryl Fee, and Kerwin Buckley will drop by when their teams are in town. You’ll spot them from across the room as each stands over 6’7. It’s emblematic of what Tulane alums in the NBL look like, and what they don’t. During my tenure, we’ve supplied the league with a steady stream of pro-ready wings and big men, defensive anchors like Kerwin, post scorers like Tevin, glass-eaters like Jheryl. 

For all their brilliance, nothing captures the imagination like a floor general at the peak of his powers, the ball handling mastery, the passing prowess, the spectacle of watching the shortest guy on the floor loom the largest. I’m talking Davin Carter at Duke, Tanner Hunter at BC, Pete Maravich at LSU. The kind of backcourt mastery that sears into the memory of college and professional fans alike. 

At the peak of my professional fandom, I remember watching Chris Paul sell insurance, Damian Lillard sell beer, and Steph Curry sell shoes. It clicked for me when I realized that point guards are so marketable, so relatable, because they’re normal-sized human beings working incredible magic in the land of giants. Kids know they’ll never be as tall as Steven Dillard, but they might be able to dribble and pass like Jarvis West. It would do wonders for this program to have a superhero of human proportions among our NBL alums. If every slight kid with a slick stepback and killer crossover wanted to be the next Patrick Tilghman, it would put Tulane on the map like nothing else could.

This program is no stranger to the scouts, the front offices, and the media circus around the draft. I’ll help you navigate that process. In return, you’ll captivate the imaginations of Tulane and NBL fans with dazzling guard play they’ve never seen come out of this program. 

That starts next year. It has to. All our starters are gone. Our five leading scorers and four leading assist guys are out the door. We took pride in forcing the 3rd most steals in the nation last year, but the four guys who averaged 1.3+ steals aren’t returning. We need you to get into the teeth of the defense and get high percentage looks for yourself and your teammates. We need you to quarterback a transition attack that had us top 10 in pace and in makes at the rim and from 3. We need you to sprint over screens, harass ball handlers, and gum up passing lanes. 

To whom much is given much is required. We’d be ecstatic to construct a system around your rare skill set, playing you 18+ minutes a night as a freshman before ceding center stage to your brand of defensive savvy and on-ball creation. You could be an offensive hub and defensive leader at any school in the country. Why not do it at a school with a consistent track record of excellence?

 I took over a program mired in mediocrity, 50th in prestige. We enter 2067 21st, on the strength of five straight tournament appearances, 4 NT wins, four straight 30+ win seasons, and the most SEC wins in the last half decade. You can point out that we haven’t finished outside the top 15 in SawPom in the past four years, but even that doesn’t quantify the fear we instill and the respect we command, year after year. 

Next year is no exception. We’ll win with finesse, behind the pure perimeter strokes of Jeff Hornsby, Eddie Blackwell, and Carte’are Hines. We’ll win with power, leveraging the menacing paint presences of Joseph Whipple and Parker Battle. We’ll win with experience, leaning on key role players from our Elite 8 run, and with youth, drawing on the contributions of our 4th consecutive top 10 recruiting class. We’ll win because it’s all we’ve done for the last half decade, because it’s muscle memory, because it’s in our DNA.

But I remember 2061 vividly. My second year in New Orleans. I had racked up my first few dollars in late fees at Howard-Tilton memorial library. I was charting my morning jog past the live oaks along Newcomb quad. I had perfected my craft with the waffle makers in the Commons dining hall. 

And we couldn’t buy a win. We returned home from a drubbing at UCF with our record at 4-15. At our next home game, a team mired in the doldrums took the floor to deafening applause, as a raucous crowd lifted us to a convincing win. I got chills at the final buzzer. As the Green Wave faithful lifted their voices, I recalled Tulane’s motto; non sibi, sed suis, not for oneself but for one’s own. The kids in the stands weren’t there because they were dying to see a doormat. They were there as members of a tight knit community, bound by an unbreakable kinship. I was captivated. People make this place my home. 

That’s why I stopped cutting players the next year, why I’m signed on through 2072, why I’ll never coach anywhere else. Because it’s not about me, it’s about us.

As you may now know, Damian noted that while PPI and PPR had functional overlaps, each had major advantages over the other depending on the kind of application.

My reaction to it 5 years ago was that it seemed miraculous, but almost no one seemed interested in it at the time, and I wondered why.

One key consideration is that the Perl regex engine can only store a few hundred captures at once. So you are at risk of blowing past that limit with even a relatively simple nested capture of some block of code. To the degree I'm right, if you want a robust solution, and you're using PPR, then it had better be as a recognizer, not a parser.

It seemed to me you would have a great vantage point for outlining PPI/PPR differences, perhaps specific to `PPIx::Regexo`, in the context of what the OP was after, and to bring attention to significant positives or negatives of PPR, with the consideration I mention, if it's as I thought it was, being perhaps the #1 thing.

Hence my intention, if you were now aware of it, was to ask you what you thought about it.

If you want an inspiring exposition of PPR's potential as Damian saw it in 2017, watch the last 10 minutes [starting at 56 minutes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob6YHpcXmTg#t=56m), where he begins:

&gt;I had given myself the power to alter Perl reality. To make Perl code do anything that I wanted.¹˒²˒³

If you like what you see in those last few minutes, and/or love to watch incredible presentations, watch the full hour of his presentation [starting 8 minutes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob6YHpcXmTg#t=8m).

¹ While Damian has a wonderful sense of humor, he was no doubt fully conscious of the vague/absurd hyperbolic/figurative language he was using. But what he said was a more substantially true statement than you might imagine. (It was definitely not a mere [pedagogical facilitation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjyXcLDd9M#t=1m40s) (Damian's fun 15 second definition)!) To be clear, PPR is just about altering Perl's *syntax*, not *any* aspect of Perl, but still, with PPR the possibilities for altering/extending/customizing Perl's syntax are impressive.³

² PPR was ostensibly driven by the desire to emulate features found in a Perl offshoot, now named Raku (since 2019). Raku began with the idea of improving Perl. One key piece was allowing anyone to alter the language's reality as Damian describes. Indeed, one of the ideas was that Raku could be altered to essentially *be* Perl and vice-versa. (This was one of the reasons why Raku's original name was Perl 6.) While in some respects this has been achieved, in others it has not. And there are those who love Perl precisely because it is ""capable enough"", ""powerful enough"", and ""workman like"" (as Damian says of Perl near the start of his presentation). Arguably a much better strategy was/is to directly improve Perl, and thus was born PPR, a key tool for lisp macro like capabilities.

³ It's not just Damian who can alter Perl reality to make it work however they wish it to. Instead anyone -- you? -- can easily wield PPR. The motivating case was to allow clean emulation of the big ideas of what's now named Raku. But the result was much more general.

Actually, that's one thing that actually fits in when you realise the actual sequence of events. The thing is, Damian wakes up from the sleeping drug while he's hidden in the chamber. He's still groggy, but realises something is wrong there, and swallows the key as a premature safety precaution. Then, L'Belle disguised as Nine-Tails opens the door, realises he's awake, and then knocks Damian out again, this time with the statue, breaking the cup and scrambling his memory. Damian's Mood Matrix session is based around that point, making him remember the events. Granted, it could be better explained, but it's not a plot hole at all. 

Oh, and as for the topic itself - I found the case alright on first replay. Nothing super amazing, maybe apart from Blackquill's shenanigans, but nothing horrible as well, maaaaybe apart from L'Belle's motive. But I found a pretty good essay on this subreddit that pointed out that this case is really good at making the player mislead themselves about the identity of Nine-Tails, and I gained a little bit more respect for it.

If someone asked me to describe this case, I would say that The Monstrous Turnabout is the synonym of an unimaginative clusterfuck. Sorrry for the vocabulary, but this is my least favorite case of this whole damn franchise.

First things first, L'Belle is an stupid culprit. Not in a ""so stupid that is kinda charming"" way like a certain character in TGAA2, but just stupid and annoying. Florent lacks charisma, but it's not only that, he severely lacks some brains. His plan is convoluted and completely unnecessary, which leads me to believe that 5-2 added things just for the sake of it.

Secondly, we have the rest of the cast, and boy oh boy, is everyone forgettable here. If you do not put an ounce of effort into remembering everyone in the franchise, you will probably forget about Jinxie, Phineas and Damian. Those three are bland as hell, and even Damian, the best character in a cast that is completely subpar, is a victim of writing that is not good at all: protecting his daughter is cool, but pretending to be Tenma Taro and the court *believing in it* completely got on my nerves.

Finally, the mystery of this episode is a clusterfuck because the writers add twists for the sake of it without realising what the changes that those twists provide entail. For example: Damian *eats* the key (okay?) to prevent the intruder from entering...after he was knocked out. L'Belle bonks Damian with a statue...after the latter was already unconscious due to a sleeping drug. Jinxie is a sleepwalker...but this twist changes *nothing at all*. Instead of a cohesive chain of changes in the plot, we got an amalgamation of twists, where everything piles onto anything, but nothing changes at all.

To sum up, I hate this case. Simon and Athena are neatly introduced here, but aside from that, everything is either mediocre or just downright bad. Anyway, hope you enjoy the remainder of DD, OP ;)

I hope this note finds you well.  

It is my pleasure to be writing to you this morning to confirm that the club has finalised a two-year contract extension for Brett Ratten as Senior Coach of our AFL team. 

As the leader of our men’s program, Brett has secured significant buy-in from his fellow coaches, staff and players alike. In addition to his strong football IQ, our players appreciate his ability to develop strong relationships, which he uses as a foundation to challenge each individual to get better and to deliver their role for the team. This balance, and the ability to unite his coaches, players and staff in a relentless quest for excellence makes Brett the best person to lead us towards our much longed-for second premiership. 

We have seen Brett adapt and grow since assuming the position of Senior Coach ahead of the 2020 season. His re-entry into the senior coaching chair has not been easy, tackling two years of COVID interruptions, hub life and the unavailability of players and staff through injury and illness. However, his focus on the continual improvement of not only our players, but his fellow staff and himself has been ever-present. 

Over the past four years, changes to our men’s football program have been steady and purposeful. This focus on growth and sustained development will remain at the core of our decision making, now bolstered by a senior coach three years into his journey with the club.

We will continue to be bold and aggressive in our list management decisions via all avenues available to us – trade, free agency and the Draft. In this pursuit, we have brought in some talented players from other clubs – Howard, Hill, Butler, Jones, Crouch and Higgins, to name a few – and look to have found some emerging talent in last year’s Draft – Wanganeen-Milera, Windhager and Owens.

We have invested in our off-field personnel - most recently Damian Carroll as Head of Development, Nick Walsh as Head of Conditioning and Corey Enright as a Senior Assistant Coach - to reinforce the development and levels of professionalism we require. We want our leaders to drive standards on and off the field, making sure our opponents know that every time they face the Saints, they have their work cut out for them.

Our club hasn’t always been in a position to completely focus on and fully invest in football for myriad of reasons. That is no longer the case. Our record membership and sponsorship levels have strengthened our off-field position, and by the end of the year we expect to have halved the club’s historical debt. This all coincides with the establishment of the Danny Frawley Centre back at our spiritual home of Moorabbin at RSEA Park.

We must be unrelenting and embrace each day as a chance to improve. Brett exemplifies this urgency daily, not only through his coaching, but through the transparent and authentic way he draws the best out of those around him. His genuine belief and deep understanding of where we all want this club to go is clear in each decision he makes, and even more so by the way he brings others along with him.

We know this journey won’t be linear. There will be bumps along the way – like our disappointing performances against Essendon and Sydney recently. There will be times when it seems too hard. There will be instances where others will doubt us and our decisions. But, we believe that we are on the right path and with the right people in the key roles to drive this club forward.

Brett and his family embody the spirit of the Saints, and I am proud to have him leading us forward.
 
Go Saints.

“Zahawi told Mr Johnson that his situation is 'not sustainable'.
Until now, Johnson had rebuffed calls by his Cabinet to step down in the wake of several ethics scandals.

A group of Johnson's most trusted Cabinet ministers visited him at his office in Downing Street Wednesday, telling him to stand down after losing the trust of his party. But Johnson instead opted to fight for his political career and fired one of the Cabinet officials, Michael Gove.

It is rare for a prime minister to cling on to office in the face of this much pressure from his Cabinet colleagues.
But by Thursday morning the man who has built a reputation for wriggling out of political controversies was forced to admit the reality of his situation. 

A Downing Street source said Johnson has spoken to Sir Graham Brady - the chairman of the parliamentary group the 1922 Committee, which plays a key role in deciding the Conservative party's leadership - and agreed to stand down, with a new party leader set to be in place by the party conference in October.
A spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister will make a statement to the country today.'

It was not immediately clear Thursday whether Johnson would stay in office while the Conservative Party chooses a new leader, who will automatically replace him as prime minister when selected.

The leader of Britain's main opposition Labour party said Johnson's expected departure as prime minister was 'good news'. But Sir Keir Starmer added that just changing the leader of the Conservative party was not enough. 'We need a proper change of government,' he said.

Johnson, 58, remained in power despite months of scandal that saw Johnson fined by police and criticized by an investigator's report for allowing rule-breaking parties in his office while Britain was in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.

Johnson urged his party and country to 'move on' and focus on the UK's economy and the war in Ukraine. But two thumping special election defeats for Johnson's Conservative Party and allegations of sexual misconduct against a senior party official sealed the fate of a politician whose ability to survive scandals was legendary.

Recent disclosures that Johnson knew about sexual misconduct allegations against Chris Pincher, a Conservative lawmaker, before he promoted the man to a senior position turned out to be the last straw.

Last week, Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip after complaints he groped two men at a private club. That triggered a series of reports about past allegations leveled against Pincher - and shifting explanations from the government about what Johnson knew when he tapped him for a senior job enforcing party discipline.

Although he stopped short of resigning, Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Zahawi tweeted: 'Prime Minister: this is not sustainable and it will only get worse: for you, for the Conservative Party and most importantly of all the country. You must do the right thing and go now.' 
Education Secretary Michelle Donelan, who was installed in post at the same time as Mr Zahawi, also declared she is quitting, barely two hours after Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis fell on his sword.

At 6.47am, Mr Lewis tweeted that he could no longer continue without 'honesty, integrity and mutual respect'. 
Minutes later Treasury minister Helen Whately followed suit saying 'there are only so many times you can apologise and move on'. 

Security minister Damian Hinds and science minister George Freeman had followed by 7.30am, and pensions minister Guy Opperman by 7.50am.
Meanwhile, Wales minister David TC Davies publicly announced that he had refused a promotion to take over from Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, who quit last night. The Attorney General, Suella Braverman has called for Mr Johnson to resign and said she is only staying in place to keep the government functioning. 

With the resignation tally now standing at 52, the government was unable to find a minister willing to go on the airwaves to speak up for the PM this morning…”

Because he plays in a spread pick and roll offense, Lillard is a far more traditional point guard.

What to watch: Anfernee Simons

Simons is at the forefront of the Trail Blazers' rebuild.

Because of the roadblocks of free agency and trades, the former first-round pick's development will play a big role in how quickly this roster improves.

Simons is a restricted free agent, and the Trail Blazers have made it known how important he is to their future.

""A core piece, definitely,"" general manager Joe Cronin told The Washington Post's Ben Golliver. ""We wanted to create a runway here for him.""

The runway Cronin mentioned are the trades of CJ McCollum and Norman Powell at the deadline, along with playing more of a feature role because of Lillard's injury.

Simons is one of four players -- including Kevin Durant, Tyler Herro and Kyrie Irving -- to average at least 20 points and 40% from 3 since Jan. 1, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information. He also attempted 10.4 3s per game (converting 42%), second most in the NBA behind Fred VanVleet. In 2021-22, he shot 46.6% on catch-and-shoot 3s, the highest rate in the NBA among players with 200 attempts. Simons had the biggest increase in points per game (+9.5) from the prior year this season.

As for a new contract, the five-year, $90 million deal that Powell signed last August is a comparable salary. An average of $16 million per year appears as an overpay, especially when you consider Simons started only five games before this season.

However, Simons will be only 23 years old when the season starts, and the development he showed in 2021-22 -- and the fact that teams like Detroit and Orlando have significant cap space to make an offer sheet -- means Portland will need to take an aggressive approach.

The Prime Minister is preparing to hit several developing countries with new “safeguard” import limits designed to protect UK manufacturers from a “flood of cheap steel” from overseas.

At the same time, ministers will announce a two-year extension of steel tariffs already imposed on developed countries and China.

The moves, being finalised for an announcement this week, will expose Mr Johnson to allegations that he is breaching World Trade Organisation rules in order to protect the British steel industry.

They are the changes cited by Lord Geidt, the Prime Minister’s former ethics adviser, when he quit earlier this month and said he was put in an “odious position” of being asked to “license” a breach of the ministerial code, which requires ministers to abide by international law.

But Mr Johnson, under mounting pressure over his leadership of the Conservative Party, is gambling on the move being backed by Labour – which has previously pushed for steel tariffs – and winning support among Red Wall voters and MPs.

A Number 10 source said: “We will act in the national interest.”

Some senior government figures are also concerned that imposing tariffs on further developing countries could lead to a trade war, with retaliatory measures applied to UK exports such as whisky. They also worry that it will damage British manufacturers who rely on imported steel.

A government figure opposed to the extension of tariffs said: “This is going to screw the economy. It is a total violation of the WTO rules. The Prime Minister said he had recognised that we have to govern as Conservatives, but this is anti-Conservative, anti-free market and anti-capitalist.”

The move has been informally agreed by key Cabinet ministers, but final details will be signed off in the coming days. Friends of Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, said he is “instinctively anti-protectionist” but understands the desire to protect UK jobs and industry.

Red Wall Conservative MPs have been lobbying Mr Johnson to impose the measures amid fears that a “glut” of steel from abroad is severely undermining British firms.

Tata Steel, the UK-based metals giant with production sites in Hartlepool and Corby, has told ministers that if imports “continue to flow into the UK at [the] same pace, let alone grow, it may cause irreparable damage to the UK industry”. It has accused “certain developing countries “of abusing their position”.

The move comes amid growing anger among Tory MPs over the party’s by-election losses in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton. Many backbenchers and ministers now fear for their seats and are considering another attempt to oust the Prime Minister.

In other developments:

Mr Johnson claimed he was making plans for three terms in Downing Street – meaning he would remain Prime Minister until the mid 2030s.
A poll suggested voters are turning on the Government and the Bank of England over the cost of living crisis, with almost one in three saying excessive public spending is “significantly” to blame for high inflation.
Writing in The Telegraph, Damian Green, the influential leader of the One Nation Conservatives caucus, warned that the Government was becoming “ineffectual” in helping with voters’ “day-to-day lives” and urged the Cabinet to “[show] leadership qualities”.
In another article for The Telegraph, David Davis, a former Brexit Secretary, attacked Mr Johnson for claiming that the only policy change demanded by his critics is to rejoin the EU’s single market. “The biggest policy difference is that we want our Government to stop talking about tax reductions and actually deliver them,” he wrote.
Therese Coffey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, used an interview to announce that benefits claimants will have to work longer hours in order to be released from job centre visits, under a crackdown devised with Mr Sunak.
Steel products fall into 19 categories, all of which were protected by anti-dumping safeguards until last summer to keep out cheap competitors. Last year, the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) recommended scrapping these safeguards on nine products.

Following a battle with Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, who is in favour of the safeguards, Ms Truss, who was then Trade Secretary, decided to ditch the protections on only four categories, which are not mass produced in Britain.

Now, with those protections due to expire this week, the TRA has advised Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Ms Truss’s successor, that there is “evidence that supports a conclusion that extending the safeguard measure where possible at individual product category level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury or threat of serious injury to UK producers”.

The TRA has also advised Ms Trevelyan that India, Tunisia, Vietnam and Turkey have all exceeded an imports quota for developing countries, meaning that they should also be subjected to the tariffs already applied to other states, for some categories of steel. Sources said Brazil and South Korea would also be hit.

Ms Trevelyan’s “proposed approach” is set out in a government document that states: “The Secretary of State has taken into account the TRA’s findings and concluded that the maintenance of TRQs [tariff rate quotas] is necessary to remedy serious injury. The Secretary of State also recognised that adjustments were required to certain TRQs to better reflect trade flows.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1656232468.0,,False,0.0,{},idsah4e,True,t3_vl04uc,False,t1_idsah4e,True,t3_vl04uc,/r/neoliberal/comments/vl04uc/boris_johnson_imposes_steel_tariffs_to_win_back/idsah4e/,1656865724.0,1.0,False,True,False,neoliberal,t5_2sfn3,r/neoliberal,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Stephanie:** I notice that Stephanie has two personalities that writers often default to: Tim Drake’s girlfriend, and overly immature rookie. These are acceptable as long as they are not her entire personality. She is deeply optimistic about the world, and she tends to be more interesting when she is written as more responsible. Even if this is early career Steph, there should be some sort of genuine determination and capability, even if she can be very amateurish at points. In regards to her relationship with Tim, you can do what you like, but try to add more dimensions to it. Do not make it pure romantic love *Tynion* ,and make her more independent beyond just being attached to Tim.

**Cassandra:** Cassandra should strike a balance in terms of characterization. Typically, she is somewhat difficult to write due to her disability (being mute and mentally impaired due to her childhood). If handled improperly, it can result in very poor characterization. So, I feel that Cassandra provides many great opportunities for emotional moments and more intimate stories due to the tragedy of her character. Writing her disability well is the key to writing her well. But, at the same time, that should not be her entire character. Cassandra is actually quite happy despite everything, and she can allow for many lighthearted moments. So, just strike the balance between comedy and tragedy with Cassandra, and understand her mental state well.

**Barbara:** So, are you writing Barbara as Batgirl or Oracle? I will give general Barbara advice, but I would appreciate clarification. Barbara is a very confident and competent person. Yet, unlike Stephanie, she has more experience under her belt. She sees herself in Stephanie, and she can serve as a role model for both her and Cassandra. Still, she is an independent character, and I feel the problem many writers have is that she is defined solely by her relationships with other characters. Give her unique traits and distinct struggles. If she is Oracle, you can explore her relationship with her disability, whether she accepts or despises it depending upon her stage in life, and her role as the connective tissue of the Bat-Family (second to Alfred, of course). 

**Tim:** Give Tim a personality beyond tech genius. Please. He can have genuine tactical intelligence. He can struggle to properly connect with other people due to dedication to the mission (forming a rift between him and his loved ones). Alternatively, he can be witty and charming. He can be a poor fighter, hence him using technology to compensate. You can explore his bisexuality and him coming to terms with it given how recent it is. Just give him deeper characterization than “tech genius who drinks coffee”. Tim having genuine insecurities that he faces over the course of the story can significantly help in making him more interesting, I listed several examples here. So, start there and build him up.

**Damian:** I have noticed as of late that Damian has been repeating the same arc of learning to have empathy for those around him constantly. So, while you could do that, you could also try to evolve him beyond that. While coming up with a new story for Damian would take a fair amount of brainstorming, one idea I have is somewhat of a meta commentary. Damian always comes back to the same cycle over and over again. The League’s teachings still remain within his mind. So, why not do a story about Damian’s mental health? Damian starts addressing that he keeps falling into this cycle, and we see him start dealing with it. I do not know how often we have explored Damian’s life outside of superheroics, so an exploration of that would be an interesting new direction. Have Damian develop more supporting characters, and see him balance his lives as a superhero and a person.

***
##**Stip Explanation**

* **Robin**

 * In Robin (2021) Damian entered a fighting tournament ran by ""Mother Soul"" and her ""League of Lazarus"".  The tournament occurred on an island where all the tournament contestants had 3 lives, and all matches were to the death.  Damian explicetly didn't hold back in this setting.  The stip places Damian into that mindset when he only had one life left.  Basically he will murder people if its the most efficient way to beat them.

 * Gives Damian Goliath, a Bat-Dragon he raised, and the gear listed above. 

* **Batman Beyond**

 * Composites Terry's default armor and the X7 prototype armor

 * In Neo-Year Terry is fighting an AI that is the entire Gotham City, and he downgrades his tech by removing any form of ""smart"" connection his suit may have.  The stips says to ignore these downgrades.

 * Gives Beyond standard gear basically, just limits quantities of some things

***
##**Justifications**

* **Robin** - Damian is comparably fast to Bow, and has comparable durability, outside of that their similarities end.  Damian has a wide array of esoteric weapons, some capable of one shotting Bow, while Bow has his arrows which Damian is generally vulnerable to.  Essentially at range Bow has a distinct advantage as Damian's ranged attacks are more limited.  In CQC Damian has more of an advantage, especially due to his high skill, but Bow probably has superior striking. 

 * Damian's stealth is drastically less effective due to Bow's tracker

 * Goliath is notably slower than Bow and not super duper great vs. Piercing (outside of the minimal amount of armor he has).  He would fuck up Bow if he could land a hit. 

* **Batman Beyond** - Terry is stronger and more durable, however he's slower than Glimmer.  Like Damian his ranged attacks aren't spectacular compared to his opponent, mainly relying on thrown Batarangs. Glimmer's energy blasts can definetly deal some degree of damage to him.  In a straight fight between the two Glimmer would likely win, however with Beyond's decent stealth/invisibility and esoterics factored it shifts it more in his favor

* **Team** - Bow's anti-stealth tracker takes the thunder out of a key advantage my team has - stealth.  Bow is virtually useless vs. Terry, but Glimmer can still take him out as in a 1v1.  Glimmer's bolts probably will struggle to hit Damian repeatedly, but he's still vulnerable to Bow's arrows.  Basically their best shot is to revert to who they are paired against in a 1v1.  

 * Glimmer's teleportation give her and Bow a strong ability to blunt any ambush or guerilla tactics Damian and Terry might try as they can instantly reposition to a more advantageous location

 * Glimmer/Bow maintain generally better ranged capabilities",True,False,,,,,0.0,1655916028.0,,1656781476.0,0.0,{},idbmxat,False,t3_vi8ub0,False,t1_idbmxat,False,t3_vi8ub0,/r/whowouldwin/comments/vi8ub0/adequate_argument_contest_2_signups_great_debate/idbmxat/,1656879493.0,5.0,False,True,False,whowouldwin,t5_2s599,r/whowouldwin,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been ALOT of them and it didn't start in 2012, some people are still saying Onyx got the shaft and consider her to at least be extended family. Not to mention people like Squire and El Guacho who just kept popping up for years. I think that u/LanternRaynerRebirth's comment about people gatekeeping really just coming down to who they thought was 'worthy' is spot on. I think that the earlier characters were more obviously 'Batman adjacent' but that Harper, Luke, and Duke felt more like DC was trying to add to the 'family'. So between roughly 1974-2004 (Roughly) there was only one net addition to family being Tim. Then in between 2004-2014 there was Jason, Damian, Harper, Luke, Batwoman, Huntress (Bertinelli), Catwoman grew closer, and arguably this is when Steph joined the family too. I think its nothing to do with Duke as a character, imo he has more staying power as family than a lot on that list. Duke came in at a time when people started to get tired of introducing new characters is all. I would argue that everybody gatekeeps in some sense, I don't care to ever see Harper, Luke, Batwoman, Huntress, or Catwoman as part of 'the family' (they can be adjacent or Batman Inc). Personally Duke didn't impress me until I read the new writer showcase story about him and Jason but now I like him and just wish that he would feel more constant. I haven't read too much of him but he isn't as well defined and his powers seem to do different things (but that goes for Damian and Jason too. hard to compare new characters to ones that have been slowly refined over the last few decades).

There is the other thing about some people just not caring to have a meta bat but that's neither here nor there for me.

Offensively, he wants the Lakers to deploy a four-out, one-in system, emphasizing passing, player movement off the ball and transition offense — the latter of which he mentioned multiples times in various interviews throughout the day.

“We have to get the ball on side to side,” Ham said. “You heard the term play with the pass, share the ball, make it easy on yourself. Instead of going one-on-four, one-on-five, you go play with your teammates, and also three-on-two situations, or two-on-one situations, caused you just moved the ball. You didn’t sit, hold it, dribble 18 times. Like, there has to be a rhythm of all the body movement.”

Ham, a defensive-leaning coach according to those who know him, will lead with that end of the floor. Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer was notably meticulous with his defensive strategy and that quality rubbed off on his protégé.

“Defensively is where you’re gonna see our biggest leaps and bounds,” Ham said. “It starts on the defensive end, and from there, we’re gonna build back to it on offense.”

Ham’s comments offer a blueprint into the types of players the Lakers will pursue to fill out their roster. As a reminder, here are the Lakers currently projected to be on next season’s roster:

Anthony Davis
Wenyen Gabriel
LeBron James
Stanley Johnson
Austin Reaves
Talen Horton-Tucker
Kendrick Nunn
Russell Westbrook
The Lakers are light in the interior and on the wing. That could obviously change, as Westbrook, Horton-Tucker and Nunn are trade candidates in an attempt to upgrade the roster this offseason. But assuming the current roster remains, here are the player archetypes — as well as some free-agent targets — the Lakers should pursue with their taxpayer midlevel exception ($6.3 million) and minimum contracts to maximize Ham’s plans.

3-and-D wings

Targets: Otto Porter Jr., Bruce Brown, Nicolas Batum, T.J. Warren, Wesley Matthews, Caleb Martin, Cody Martin, Danuel House, Taurean Prince, Gary Harris, Joe Ingles, Amir Coffey

The Lakers need to add at least a couple of players — ideally, in the 6-foot-6 to 6-foot-9 range — that can defend multiple positions, make 3s at a 35-plus percent clip and help grease the wheels offensively when needed (cut, push the ball in transition, attack closeouts, crash the offensive glass, etc.).

It’s difficult to find players for the taxpayer midlevel exception that check every box. Half of the above players will likely make more than that. But the Lakers need to prioritize this archetype after striking out so badly this season. They can offer a starting frontcourt spot, significant playing time and exposure that most playoff teams can’t match.

Part of the reason for the drop-off in last season’s defense was losing Kentavious-Caldwell Pope, Kyle Kuzma and Alex Caruso — players that fit this skill set, to varying degrees. This is the lifeblood of the new NBA. Look at the teams that made the conference finals: The Golden State Warriors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks. They each have multiple 3-and-D players and small-ball lineups that are versatile and switchable.

The Lakers just don’t have those types of players. Their current wings can’t shoot and/or are undersized.

James fits the mold, of course, but he’s overqualified, will be 38 years old next season and has to carry a heavy scoring and playmaking load. Davis can slide down and defend wings — as he’s done against the Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard and Paul George — but that often takes him away from the paint, where he’s a monster help defender, and it’s physically taxing.

They need help. The Lakers need better wings.

Stretch-5s

Targets: Mo Bamba, Chris Boucher, Bobby Portis, Dewayne Dedmon, Thomas Bryant, Jeff Green, Serge Ibaka, Nemanja Bjelica, Mike Muscala, Gorgui Dieng

With three scorers that live in the paint — James, Davis and Westbrook — one of the easier ways to create driving lanes and maintain spacing is with a stretch-five. A four-out, one-in offense doesn’t have to mean only Davis on the interior. It can also be James, who’s a mismatch nightmare in the post, or Westbrook, who can still expose smaller guards and weaker wings. A stretch big is an easy way to open up the floor.

Aside from Marc Gasol, the Lakers haven’t had a stretch-five in the James-Davis era. They’ve trended toward more athletic, rim-running bigs. The blueprint worked in 2019-20 with JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard but fell flat in 2020-21 with Andre Drummond and 2021-22 with a washed-up DeAndre Jordan and an older Howard. Perhaps it’s time to rethink their approach.

Depending on who they’re able to sign, this type of player could potentially start alongside Davis, allowing the Lakers to keep him at power forward while remaining bigger defensively. But the key, in that case, is finding a player who could protect the rim, too. Not all of the above names can do that — in fact, some are defensive liabilities.

The Lakers have limited spending power, though. Barring Myles Turner or Brook Lopez becoming available via trade, L.A. will likely be adding a fringe starter or third/fourth big.

Mobile/athletic bigs

Targets: Kevon Looney, Nic Claxton, JaVale McGee, Isaiah Hartenstein, Damian Jones, Bismack Biyombo

This is the type of big the Lakers have preferred in the James-Davis era, as they’re traditionally better at finishing in the paint, rebounding and protecting the rim than the stretch-five archetype (there are exceptions, of course).

Assuming Davis starts at center as the primary “in” player in Ham’s offense, their backup center may be the only traditional center on the roster. The Lakers can still make these types of players work within Ham’s system, but they’ll need younger, more athletic and more effective options than Jordan and Howard.

At a minimum, they need one athletic, defensive-minded backup center as Davis insurance.

Defensive-minded guards

Targets: Gary Payton II, Victor Oladipo, Ricky Rubio, Delon Wright, Jevon Carter, Austin Rivers

The Lakers’ backcourt heavily trends toward scoring. Westbrook, Nunn and Horton-Tucker are shoot-first ballhandlers and playmakers. Reaves is the only plus-defender, and even then, with his current frame, there are certain matchups he can’t hold up in.

Los Angeles needs better backcourt defense. It’s more of a secondary need than a primary need, as Reaves and Johnson — and possibly Nunn or Horton-Tucker — can use their length against smaller and quicker ballhandlers. But there will come a time when the Lakers need a specialist who can lock in for at least 15 to 20 minutes a night against a star ballhandler or a spark-plug scorer.

As Ham said in his introduction, good defense generates good offense and vice versa. If the Lakers can add a player or two who can pressure the ball, play passing lanes and generally wreak havoc, they’ll have a shot to recreate the fast-breaking identity that made them so imposing during their championship season.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1655009043.0,,False,0.0,{},ic1z0cr,False,t3_vae4yw,False,t1_ic1z0cr,False,t3_vae4yw,/r/lakers/comments/vae4yw/the_player_archetypes_the_lakers_should_target_in/ic1z0cr/,1656918844.0,86.0,False,True,False,lakers,t5_2qhv6,r/lakers,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4. Rerolling can be valuable, as mentioned above. Hiring both Gordon and Chester early on in probably the biggest mistake one can make, I'd say. Later on some SMs are less desirable than others. For example, if you have Santa, you might not want Jade Kim, since she's worse. Each re-roll on a new hire will increase in cost though, so be careful. For now I'd say just reroll on Chester.
5. Just complete the mine and move on to the next, don't worry. There's nothing to lose.
6. I'd say no.

Pretty completely disagree that any of them are ""done"". You may nitpick these as not worth it, or whathaveyou, but all would be directions id be quite happy to see explored and given full attention/background development/anywhere in between in demonstrating their lifes and characters continue to grow. 

For demonstration purposes and to keep the comment limited enough, I'll keep it to 3 developments per character. 

**Dick**: 

- Thanks to this season, we now know that Dick has been using the Dan Danger identity to return to his roots as a circus performer. This opens up a whole new range of possibilities; but I'll give just one. What happens to Halys Circus when Jack Haly dies? Hes gotten quite old so its only a matter of time, in some cases, he leaves it to Dick, but what happens to Dicks escape would invariably require some work from Dick. One of the only people from Dicks life before he was involved with the bats.

- Barbara and Dick got together after Orphan crippled her. While everything seems as though its fine, understood and forgiven, Dick has more reason than any of the Bats to hold onto some semblance of an animosity towards Cass, and it wouldn't be overly difficult to bring something that he's tried to bury to the surface. Whether it be a complication to Barbaras injury that sees her need further treatment, Cass being adopted by Barbara or being given her mantle as Batgirl, plenty of opportunities both positive or negative could bring up old wounds; which Dick would have to deal with.

- The way that Dick had been a mentor to Tim had been very clearly influenced contrastingly to how he'd handled Jason. Jasons return is going to bring back a flood of things to work through and the processing of Robin-generational trauma. Which, I think would be exemplified if we have a 4th non-Damian Robin just beginning at the same time. Someone for Dick and Tim to clash over and bring out their issues before Jason opens the whole system up. 

**Kaldur**: 

- We got a glimpse of Kaldurs childhood in his arc, how he was forced to grow up and really block back his emotions. He has begun to relax, sort of, now. But I feel this could easily be only a first step into Kaldur becoming Kaldur. We certainly havent had substantial emotion since his arc, just focus. Him not being the one to make the sacrifice in Boom Tube (in contrast to failsafe) was a nice touch, but there is easily more here and now that his parents are more solid supporting characters, plenty to do there. 

- In the Prize, it was pretty clear that Kaldur and Black Manta's relationship isnt Done, and with Kaldur being the most confrontational vs Amanda Waller, there is plenty of plot to go there. I think a key development, would refer to how in Kaldurs arc he says Calvin Durham is his father in every way that matters. That sentiment, and the behaviour that matches that sentiment (so, not calling Black Manta ""father"" when face to mask), being made firm to Manta, is I think an important thing that Kaldur has yet to achieve.

- What does Kaldur do when he's not being a hero? The answer here, I think is made clear by his arc, that he hasnt actually found anything for himself yet. Algae chewing, equivalent to drinking, isnt exactly a sustainable past time. Just relaxing with loved ones, is nice and great to see, but can lead to codependency. With how interesting Atlantis is, even something as mundane as this could be a full interesting plot I believe, and I have a suggestion for what it could be. In Kaldur's arc, we see that he sort of breaks in the Leviathan of the undersea. How about we see Kaldur take time working with animals, which due to Atlantis, are spectacular and offer plenty of danger and thrill. Jurok Byss, would be an excellent figure to introduce as a mentor in such a capacity. And theres no shortage of designs, all it takes is looking at the original Aquaman comics, where Orin and Aqualad's regular opponent was some strange sea creature.

**Conner**

- I find it quite curious someone here says, that Conner's now ""human"". My view is completely the opposite; since S2, through M'gann's arc, he's been rejecting labels like Earthling as he prefers to identify with his Kryptonian half. Dying to Krytponite, I viewed as a beautiful validation of that. That launched him into the one place where he could truly explore Kryptonian culture, and while the season may end with a rejection of *that* manifestation of the culture, I don't think that's likely to be the full case. With some elements likely to be left over, that exploration I feel can only continue and continue to be meaningful. In any case, he certainly hasn't explored what it means to be ""Half Human Superboy"", even if the Kryptonian half were to be done.

- With his death, Clark reflected considerably upon his initial treatment of Conner. Now, though Conner's back, Clark has a secret - one that he likely wont be telling Conner. These factors, particularly the secret given the themes of the show, I feel could very easily impact their relationship. Conner, could easily view Clark being overly protective of him - not letting him be in volatile situations, while also being distant enough to not give up the secret, as Clark not trusting him - a reversion to their original relationship, due to the ""reset"" and his involvement with the Zods. Not the case, but misunderstandings over secrets leading to tension and personal development, is certainly within the show's repetoire. 

- His relationship with Jonny, avuncular as it is, I feel is pretty signficant and as Jonny grows (and develops his powers, as he has been this Season which wasn't something Superboy found out), it is only going to increase in significance with them being the only two human-kryptonian hybrids (so far). 

**M'gann**

- We now have the excellent addition of Em'ree to M'gann's life. While these two are good now, she opens up a lot of other interactions that could be possible. Even putting aside their Other siblings, all of whom could have differing dynamics with M'gann, we have the fact that Em'ree has been married twice. I think it is moderately likely to be a polyamorous situation, which will bring in two characters whose relationship with M'gann is undefined and could develop and compound the dynamic that exists between Em'ree and M'gann (and if polyamorous, have M'gann question her own relationships (though I'm certain she'd end up remaining monogamous)).

- Now that we've got the the Zeta Tubes active between Earth and M'arzz, I feel it likely to have further repercussions on M'gann's actions. We've seen G Gordon trying to stir anti-Martian sentiment when they made the Comms Satellite in Season Two, he's been absent this season, but could easily come back to greater antagonisation; especially if partnering with the likes of R'ess E'dda for separatist. 

- M'gann's identity and appearance congruent with her identity, are essentially complete now. But that isn't necessarily the end to that; although she's happy with herself, others won't necessarily be and dealing with that can always be a thing she has to deal with - just as many others who go through such identity and appearance finding processes. And, I feel with her role as a guidance councillor at Happy Harbour, she could expound upon her journey in assisting other characters who can go through similar. Making her journey, and the steps that she took to get there, more explicit, while stepping her identity from a self-fulfilling role to something that helps others as a mentor figure. 

**Artemis**

- Lets begin with Artemis' new relationship with Jason Bard. He's someone who, although arguably a hero in his own right, is not a part of The Life. While Artemis, being raised by Sportsmaster, was never *not* part of The Life (though she was on the other side of it till S1). When some of her earliest friendships were with Icicle Jr, while her relationships with Wally, Zatanna, the rest of the Team, define most of her adolescent and young adult life, this is unfamiliar ground. As we see with the reticence with introducing her sister. It will be good for her, I think, but it is something she'll need to deal with. 

- Cassandra Savage played on a sympathy that Artemis has towards the disabled with her glamour charm. Though they weren't explicit with it in the arc, I feel it is something that could be more greatly explored. Jason, is missing his leg. Her mother, is wheelchair bound. Barbara who I'd say is fair to call a close friend, is similarly wheelchair bound, while Cass Wu-San who reflects Artemis journey in many ways, is mute. Exploring Artemis feelings on this or even just the betrayal in using that against her, I think could easily be significant. 

- Should Jade return to living with Will, while Artemis has gotten into a reflexive routine with her family there, what becomes of Artemis? While I'm sure she wouldn't be kicked out, she may feel as though its not her place anymore and need a balancing of the dynamics before settling into her new role. And of course, there's a the question of how Jade's time with Ra's, which Artemis is said to be visiting, will affect things.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1654569467.0,,1654576405.0,0.0,{},ibfz1cd,False,t3_v6ga3p,False,t1_ibfz1cd,True,t3_v6ga3p,/r/youngjustice/comments/v6ga3p/basically_all_the_character_arcs_for_the_main/ibfz1cd/,1656937856.0,1.0,False,True,False,youngjustice,t5_2t3l1,r/youngjustice,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],False,,its-just-the-vibe,1648944085.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_lgs4gtsw,False,False,"Perth property price rises have ground to a halt since homeowners saw their first interest rate rise in more than a decade.New data released on Wednesday shows across Australia, home prices fell for the first time since the start of the pandemic, dropping 0.11 per cent in May according to the PropTrack Home Price Index.

Perth house prices grew only marginally in May, with the median value growing just 0.24 per cent while unit prices have continued to fall across the city, dropping 0.2 per cent.Many regional parts of the country, including WA (-0.43 per cent) recorded falls.PropTrack economist and report author Paul Ryan said while May housing market activity was disrupted by the federal election, price growth had been slowing for some time.“Conditions have now shifted rapidly from 2021,” he said.“This follows expectations of sharply higher interest rates in 2022, which will erode the affordability of existing prices.

“The speed of official interest rate hikes and wages growth remain the key unknowns for price growth moving forward.

“Perth has experienced a smaller cycle in the post-pandemic period than much of the rest of the country.

“However, it is still experiencing growth, by contrast to the large cities on the east coast.

“Regardless, like the rest of the country, Perth has seen a slowdown in growth in 2022 as expectations for interest rates have increased significantly.”

Ryan said he expected the Perth market to experience a period of modest growth due to increasing inflation and further rate rises.

“There is some divergence between financial markets, which are pricing in further hikes of more than 2 percentage points in 2022, and major bank forecasters, who believe rates will be closer to 1 percentage points higher at the end of the year,” he said.

“These rate raises will make a difference for buyers.

“The RBA will be closely watching the performance of the economy, wages growth, and the continued effect of supply constraints and other international factors on inflation in judging how high interest rates need to rise.”

Independent economist Saul Eslake said as interest rate hikes added up it would put downward pressure on property prices in all cities.

“But it will probably take more than 25 basis points we have seen so far,” he said.

“It’s almost impossible to say with any confidence whether the falls in Sydney and Melbourne property prices over the past two or three months, are largely or even in part due to last month’s rate rise, or to earlier fears of rate rises.

“It could be that buyers in those cities where prices have fallen have simply concluded that prices there are already too high.

“Perth prices fell for several years in the aftermath of the end of the mining investment boom of the early 2010s so they may still be seen as more sustainable despite rising rates.”

Eslake said while Labor’s “help to buy” scheme would in principle put upward pressure on house prices, its limit of 10,000 participants, income test and ceiling on the value of properties that could be acquired under the scheme would have a limiting effect.

A national survey conducted by Perth property advisory Momentum Wealth found two out of five active investors – those planning to buy in the next 12 months - nominated Perth as their preferred property market.

Managing director Damian Collins said Australia-wide, investor confidence in Sydney and Melbourne was experiencing a decline, while Perth and Brisbane are gaining traction as preferred investment markets.

“Perth in particular offers investors considerable value for money,” he said.

“The latest Housing Affordability Report by the Real Estate Institute of Australia confirms that in the December quarter of 2021, 26.2 per cent of household income was needed to service a home loan in WA, compared to 37.3 per cent in Victoria and 46.5 per cent in New South Wales.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1654035358.0,,False,0.0,{},iaprk2f,True,t3_v21mqq,False,t1_iaprk2f,False,t3_v21mqq,/r/australia/comments/v21mqq/interest_rate_rise_puts_brakes_on_perth_property/iaprk2f/,1655327854.0,5.0,False,True,False,australia,t5_2qh8e,r/australia,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],False,,Geminii27,1299046039.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4wrg1,False,False,"**Understanding Disability**

The first thing you’ll want to do is understand that [Autism is a disability](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137428318_14). Now, not every Autistic person agrees with this claim — the term “disability” is loaded, and its definition is complex. It’s one of those words that is particularly subject to cultural baggage — it means something a bit different in Europe, for instance, than it means in the United States, in ways that can be hard to quantify.

So let me give you this quick pointer: if an autistic person says “[Autism is not a disability](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/jul/16/autism-doesnt-have-to-be-viewed-as-a-disability-or-disorder)” they are correct and you should believe them. If an Autistic person says “Autism is a disability” they are also correct, and you should believe them. I release you from the perceived obligation of reconciling these claims — just understand that this is a complex subject and both “Autism” and “Disability” are hard to define in objective terms.

But I want to be clear about one thing: to call Autism a disability is not to call it a pathology. Autism is a valid way of being, and while there may be certain pathologies that only affect Autistic people it’s not the case that we are [intrinsically broken](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-10810-001).

But that doesn’t mean we aren’t disabled, and in American culture at least it’s important to understand the ways in which the disabled community is let down by journalists if we want to understand how to do better by Autistic people. So.

To many people disability [evokes feelings of revulsion or pity](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/705748) — disability sounds like a bad word to people who don’t have to deal with it. In reality, somewhere [between 15%](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/factsheet-on-persons-with-disabilities.html) and [25% of human beings](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html) are disabled and most humans will spend at least some portion of their life with a disability.

A lot of media coverage of Autism fails in the way that news coverage of all disability fails — it uncritically embraces the [revulsion and pity](https://neuroclastic.com/autism-autistic-solidarity-theory-of-mind-relating/?amp) that the author may be feeling. We can feel this when it happens, it’s really obvious. This may make for journalism that abled readers can relate to more easily, but it does so by treating the disabled people as objects of pity and revulsion rather than as full, complex human beings with their own perspectives.

There are a lot of ways to learn more about disability, and one way in may be [this thread](https://twitter.com/mykola/status/1471495169274826765) I wrote on twitter that polls abled people about some questions relating to disability and then analyzes their responses. But my key advice here is really simple:

**Key Takeaway: Interview Disabled People**

You can mitigate almost all of this (unintentional! understandable!) harm by making sure that your interviews include the actually disabled people, not just the people in their lives. Sometimes this may seem complex — not all Autistic people can speak, for instance, and even if they can they aren’t necessarily treated by caregivers as trusted narrators of their own experiences and you may experience pushback simply for asking for their perspective. It is still your job to seek out authentic and relevant disabled voices for your piece.

**Key Takeaway: We Are Not A Monolith**

Every disabled person is different. Every experience of disability is unique. It’s often not enough to interview a single disabled source, especially if that’s juxtaposed against a dozen abled sources. That way lies tokenism. The truth is if you want bonus points you can find disagreement within the disabled community, and use that to enrich the complexity of your reporting in a way that doesn’t pick sides but recognizes that these issues aren’t black and white.

**The Double-Empathy Problem**

There’s a fascinating bit of research by Damian Milton that up-ends a lot of assumptions that a lot of people make about Autism, and it’s called the “[Double Empathy Problem](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/double-empathy-explained/)”.

Let me put this in no uncertain terms: if you do not understand the Double Empathy problem you have no business writing anything at all about autism for general consumption. This is not because you are a bad person — it’s because you have missed [the most important memo](https://noncompliantpodcast.com/2020/01/04/we-need-much-better-standards-of-research-in-autism-intervention-an-interview-with-dr-damian-milton/amp/) in Autism research in decades.

The Double-Empathy problem conclusively demonstrates that the communication breakdowns that Autistic people experience are not one-sided. Rather it turns out that allistic (not autistic) people struggle to understand Autistic people just as much as Autistic people struggle to understand allistic people.

In other words, it is NOT THE CASE that autistic people have a communication deficit; rather, it seems to be the case that the more two people diverge in terms of the way they experience the world the less able to understand each other they both become.

Because most people in the world are not Autistic it seems “obvious” that Autistic people have a communication problem; what’s really mind-blowing is the realization that it’s not a property of Autism but rather a property of expectation mismatch between Autistic and non-Autistic communicators.

**Key Takeaway: It’s Not a Deficit**

This means that anyone talking about “deficits” in Autistic communication is blaming Autistic people for a systemic problem that exists squarely in the interplay between Autistic and non-Autistic expectations. We are not broken, and we are not responsible for the fact that our communication style is different. We must be respected as such.

**Key Takeaway: Notice the Emotional Labor**

The implications here are staggering. It means that Autistic people have taken the blame for these communication breakdowns wholesale, and we spend our lives trying make up for what we’re told is a deficit on our end. Nobody grants us the same benefit of the doubt and interpretive generosity that we are trained to give others — we have to get it right on the first try or we’re seen as problems.

⁠**Identity-First Language**

You probably learned to refer to disabled people using something called “person-first language”. This means if you’re referring to someone with diabetes you’ll say “Person with Diabetes”, not “Diabetic Person”. This is valid, and many people with e.g. Diabetes want to be referred to this way.

You should always defer to the individual when referring to them, because some people feel strongly about this. Some people with Diabetes will prefer to be called Diabetics, even if they’re a minority, and their will should be respected too.

In the Autistic community we often feel differently about person-first language. Many of us have a lifetime of trauma from parents, caregivers, teachers, friends and partners trying to separate the “problematic” parts of us from the “real” parts of us. “Person with Autism” is the language of someone who wants to think of the Autistic person in their life as experiencing an external challenge that can be overcome.

We overwhelmingly prefer “Autistic Person”, because it turns out our Autism is not some pathology that interferes with the functioning and expression of the “real” us — it is in fact a core part of our identity, and trying to erase that truth is in fact a way to erase important parts of our experience.

**Key Takeaway: Individual Choice Matters**

My next “key takeaway” is going to be to tell you that there is [overwhelming support](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-020-04858-w) for “identity-first language” in the Autistic Community. Please note I am not saying “There is unanimous support”. Plenty of Autistic people DO feel like their Autism is a pathology that they don’t want to identify with, and prefer PFL. Their individual choices must be respected too.

**Key Takeaway: Overwhelming Autistic Preference**

That said, most Autistic adults on [poll](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26134030/) after [poll](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-020-04425-3) say that they prefer “Autistic Person” to “Person with Autism”. So when you write or talk about Autism in your coverage one thing we all look at is whether you chose to use IFL or PFL. It’s not that choosing PFL is that big a deal in the big picture (though some people feel strongly about it!) — it’s that by choosing PFL you are signaling to your readers that you either don’t know or don’t care that most Autistic adults prefer IFL, and most of us will read your coverage accordingly.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1653732838.0,,False,0.0,{},iaaqd4x,False,t3_uz0832,False,t1_iaaqd4x,True,t1_iaapo99,/r/AutismTranslated/comments/uz0832/easily_the_best_article_ive_ever_read_explaining/iaaqd4x/,1655357858.0,1.0,False,True,False,AutismTranslated,t5_zlszm,r/AutismTranslated,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Authors:** Tom Cowie and Benjamin Preiss

&gt; Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce stood high above the Murray River, ready for day one of the election campaign.

&gt; He was in the seat of Nicholls, prime Nationals country, to open a $324 million bridge, replacing an antiquated crossing that first joined the river towns of Echuca-Moama more than a century ago.

&gt; Joyce’s presence on the Victorian border indicated his party was sufficiently worried about losing a seat with a 20 per cent margin that he needed to shore up votes.

&gt; “There’s no such thing as a safe seat,” he said, as paddle steamers chugged behind him.

&gt; Attention during this federal election has focused on Liberal strongholds in inner Melbourne, where the “teal” independents are threatening to defeat government MPs.

&gt; The Coalition is also staring down serious challenges in the bush, leading to a fight to prevent seats from becoming marginal – or worse – losing them altogether.

&gt; Nicholls, which takes in the central and northern Victorian towns of Echuca, Shepparton, Seymour and Yarrawonga, is a prime example.

&gt; #""I do think it’s one of the most likely to be won by an independent, it’s a stronger chance than some of the urban seats."" ABC election analyst Antony Green

&gt; Several circumstances have put the former seat of Murray in play: the retirement of popular sitting National MP Damian Drum, a prominent cashed-up independent in Rob Priestly, and the Liberals and Nationals both contesting the seat.

&gt; “I do think it’s one of the most likely to be won by an independent, it’s a stronger chance than some of the urban seats,” says the ABC’s election analyst Antony Green.

&gt; Priestly needs a minimum 30 per cent primary vote to win, Green says. Preferences become crucial, he says, because leakage between the Coalition partners could help elect the independent.

&gt; “There is a bit of a history that Liberal preferences flow more strongly to National than the other way around,” he says.

&gt; Once lost, the seat may prove difficult to regain – neighbouring Indi elected Cathy McGowan in 2013 and is still independent three elections later.

&gt; Independent MP Suzanna Sheed also won the state seat of Shepparton in 2014, the same year [major employer SPC was knocked back for assistance by the Abbott government.] (https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/spc-ardmona-pm-rejects-request-for-help-20140130-31pqn.html)

&gt; “People are open to the idea of an independent,” she says.

&gt; While voters want their fair share of spending, as shown by the wrangling over credit for the new Dhungala bridge spanning the Murray, it’s what flows underneath that can make or break politicians.

&gt; The Goulburn Valley is among Victoria’s food bowls, producing vast quantities of stone fruit, apples, tomatoes and dairy.

&gt; Water policy is vitally important here, with local anger simmering over the Murray-Darling basin plan and water buybacks.

&gt; “A lot of people are making money out of water,” says Rod Mauger, a 66-year-old undecided voter who spoke with The Sunday Age on Wyndham Street in Shepparton this week.

&gt; “The important thing for me is that water should be used to actually grow food.”

&gt; The potential recovery of 450 gigalitres of water from irrigators, to be directed back to the environment downriver, is a key concern.

&gt; The Nationals sought to scrap the 450 gigalitre component of the plan in parliament but lost that fight with the Liberals.

&gt; Shepparton is not a typical election battleground, but the town is awash with advertising putting Priestly’s name front and centre in voters’ minds.

&gt; All major candidates were visible in corflutes on fences this week, but paid marketing such as billboards clearly favoured the independent.

&gt; Priestly points out his fundraising is entirely grassroots, with donations coming from local farmers and businesses.

&gt; Seeking to win over a conservative electorate, Priestly says he does not have the support of Simon Holmes a Court’s Climate 200 fundraising vehicle or the local Voices for Nicholls advocacy group.

&gt; But, like the city independents, he backs climate action, including an emissions cut of up to 50 per cent by 2030, and a new federal integrity commission.

&gt; Priestly has taken leave as a councillor at Greater Shepparton City and spruiks his industry credentials, which includes his successful Gouge Linen business.

&gt; He dismisses criticism that independents would create dysfunction.

&gt; “If there are more people with real-world experience in parliament as independents that can only be good for democracy,” he says.

&gt; He says locals have been let down on water: “We’re still in a situation where that is hanging over some heads of this community.”

&gt; Indi has provided the playbook for a rural independent taking it up to the political establishment – even down to the orange branding being used by Priestly.

&gt; Liberal candidate Steve Brooks says he is encouraged by those voting early this week.

&gt; “I could count on one hand the number of negative interactions I’ve had,” he says.

&gt; The pomegranate grower, who has worked as a commodity trader and teacher, says the Liberals previously held the seat for 20 years until 2016 and can do it again.

&gt; Brooks says the electorate desperately needs more healthcare workers, citing the Coalition’s promise of $19.5 million for a new clinical health school in Shepparton.

&gt; #Three-cornered contest in Nicholls

&gt; Rob Priestly - INDEPENDENT - On independents holding the balance of power: “If there are more people with real-world experience in parliament as independents that can only be good for democracy.""

&gt;Sam Birrell - NATIONALS - On voter frustration with major parties: “I understand that but we have to find a way to govern the country.”

&gt; Steve Brooks - LIBERAL - On meeting voters at pre-poll this week: “I could count on one hand the number of negative interactions I’ve had.""

&gt; He rejects suggestions Nicholls is overlooked, arguing former Liberal MP Sharman Stone successfully attracted significant funding.

&gt; Brooks agrees water management is a major issue, insisting the additional 450 gigalitres only be recovered if there is no economic or social impact.

&gt; Nationals candidate Sam Birrell, who resigned from his job as Committee for Greater Shepparton chief executive to contest the election, believes he has a reasonable chance of helping scrap the 450 gigalitres from the plan.

&gt; A poster on his campaign office reads: ‘KEEP OUR WATER HERE’. “I think we could negotiate it out in a Coalition government and that’s what I’ll be trying to do,” he says.

&gt; Birrell dismisses any suggestion that an independent could achieve the same outcome as “farcical”. However, he acknowledges voters are frustrated. “I understand that,” he says. “But we have to find a way to govern the country.”

&gt; While Joyce has visited several times, the Nationals leader doesn’t appear on local campaign material. Birrell says Joyce is not a drag on the vote.

&gt; “If he’s coming here to make announcements and help me deliver things that make the people’s lives of Nicholls better, then that’s an advantage.”

&gt; Meanwhile, in the south-west of Victoria, another regional independent is hoping to tap into major party malaise.

&gt; Comedian and former Triple J radio host Alex Dyson is taking on Wannon Liberal MP Dan Tehan, who has a 10 per cent margin.

&gt; Dyson collected 10 per cent in 2019 after his [video performing a dance before jumping off a pier dressed in a suit went viral.] (https://www.facebook.com/alexanderedwarddyson/videos/474610580025120/)

&gt; “My first campaign was small, but I had young people behind me,” he says.

&gt; This time, Dyson is serious. Stronger action on climate change, integrity in politics and tackling regional housing shortages are resonating with voters, he says.

&gt; He is backed by Climate 200, which he says will contribute about $60,000. He has also raised more than $20,000 locally and is tipping in a lot of his own money

&gt; Although Wannon isn’t marginal, Dyson thinks he can win, particularly if he can at least double his primary vote.

&gt; But Tehan, the minister for trade, tourism and investment in the Morrison government, appears relaxed about the challenge. He says he defeated five independents in 2010.

&gt; “This is something that’s been going on since federation and will continue,” he says. “Isn’t it wonderful? We live in the best democracy in the world.”

Licensing beats:  
You can go to Soundclick or Beatstars for this  
Most beatmakers offer 2 for 1 deals or 3 for 1 deals, so use them when they exist.  
Different levels of licensing: wav, mp3, with stems, how many radio stations you are allowed to play on, whether you can can use the beat for live performances, how many streams you're covered for, whether the dj's tag is on the beat.  The lower licensing deals are usually like $20-30, the mediums are usually $100, the highs are usually $200.  
You’ll get a license document to download when you buy the license.  
If you really blow up, your limited license probably won’t cover you and you’ll probably have to split the revenue 50/50.  
When you're still an absolute novice, you may not yet be at the stage where you need to worry about licensing beats for professional use.  Go look for free beats somewhere.

Room Treatment:  
Those egg crate looking things people use are room treatment.  It's not soundproofing like some people think.  The point of them is so that your echoes get absorbed and the mic doesn't pick them up.  There are different budget things you can use for room treatment like blankets, clothes in your closet, etc.

Microphone:  
You'll want some sort of USB condenser microphone.  The first one I bought was like $40 and it had a quiet buzzing noise that ruined the songs.  The next one I bought was a HyperX Quadcast, which was like $120, and it sounds pretty good.  You will want a mic stand and a pop filter.  Also some headphones.

DAW (Digital Audio Workstation):  
This is the software where you will be recording and mixing your tracks.  
There are multiple free DAW's.  The one I use is Waveform Traktion 11.  
Plug-ins are software that can alter the sound of your vocals, and they're an essential part of making hip hop.  DAW's come with a default set of plug-ins, but you will probably want to add some third-party plug-ins to the repertoire.  
Sync-up the DAW meter with the beat.  That'll make editing easier.  
Set your mic gain -18 to -6 so that it doesn't clip.  
Experiment with best distance from the mic based on voice, because different amounts of bass in voice will lead to different ideal distances from the mic.  Usually about 5 inches away.  
Sing directly into the microphone.  Make sure that you aren't singing off to the side of it.  
Keep recording your vocal takes until you have completely perfect takes.  Maybe break it up into 4 or 8 bars at a time instead of trying to hit the whole verse in one take; because you will make more small mistakes than you think.  
Sing loudly enough.  Singing loudly and further away sounds better than whispering close-up.Also remember ad-libs after your track.  
After vocals are recorded comes vocal editing (fading, deleting breaths, pops, EQ, moving words on-beat).  
Vocal tuning, mixing, and mastering are three separate steps that you might do yourself or hire professionals to do to your tracks after it's recorded.  
You may want to save a vocal preset of how you like your plug-ins set by default for each track.

Writing:  
Keep your verses relatively short, like 16 bars or less, so that it's easier to deliver without getting jammed-up with saliva or running out of air.  
Write your verses with breathing breaks built right into them.  
Try to make sure that your song is catchy and easy to remember.  Songs that are harder to remember are harder to perform live.

Tax considerations:  
You might be able to write-off certain expenses on your taxes; like equipment, a room in the house used as a studio, and advertisement (and materials related to publicity and advertisement).  
If your itemized deductions don't exceed the standard deduction, then there may be no point in trying to write them off.

Distribution:  
To upload your songs to every streaming platform at once (iTunes, Spotify, etc.), use a distribution service, like Distrokid, which is $20/year.  You will also need to get Spotify For Artists (I forget why, but I think it's in order to pitch your songs to editors' playlists).  In order to pitch your songs to playlists, you will need to schedule them for a release date like 4 weeks in the future (need some sort of premium membership to do that) and then pitch the song.  You can only have one song pitched at a time, so basically you'll be dropping each single at least like 4 weeks apart.

Promotion:  
I've never been very successful at promoting music, but I can tell you that you can buy youtube ads for increments of $50, have some very basic levels of audience-targeting, and your song will get about 600 ""views,"" although it's basically a view if they watch it for more than 5 seconds before clicking skip.  But using a whole song as an ad might be less effective than creating a clip that is designed to be optimized for advertisement and has the catchiest parts of the song plus your artist name.  
Twitter ads I think are also in increments of $50.  You probably won't get nearly as many impressions this way, and probably not as many views of your song.  But it could help you get some Twitter followers (unlikely to get many), and the people who do play your song could be a little bit more seriously engaged rather than forced to hear 5 seconds of it.

Monetization:  
A distributor like Distrokid will automatically monetize your track.  You make something like $1 per 3000 streams.  
In order to get monetization on youtube, your channel needs a certain amount of streams, hours streamed, and subscribers.  In order to achieve this, it's impractical to have a channel that is just song uploads.  You will need to find a way to upload absurd amounts of interesting and easy-to-create content.  For example, chess masters have channels where they upload chess games all the time, and it's pretty low effort to just record and comment on chess games while you're playing them.

2. Use MLE wisely as it's our best way to get a decent role player. Primary target is Otto Porter Jr. If not, try to get Kyle Anderson or resign Monk. Key point is to try to get a bigger 3D wing.

News Corp can reveal female umpires have been touched and grabbed during matches, overheard lewd discussions at training about their “boobs”, and received explicit photos.  
  
Other complaints include female umpires being forced to share change rooms with naked goal umpires described as “grandpas” and being racially vilified in the workplace.  
  
The damning revelations have been exposed in a secret report obtained by News Corp – “Girls and women in Australian football umpiring: Understanding registration, participation and retention”.  
  
The extensive research into an extreme shortage of female umpiring, conducted by The University of Sydney in 2020-21 and funded by the AFL, was published last August.  
  
The AFL did not want the findings made public.  
  
The 62-page document – compiled by former AFLW field umpire and researcher Dr Victoria Rawlings and former AFL community umpiring development boss Damian Anderson – includes accounts from 27 umpires (26 females and one non-binary) across four focus groups from Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales and ACT.  
  
The interviews reveal a toxic, male-dominated culture as well as women being subject to sexual harassment from spectators, umpire coaches and fellow umpires.

One female umpire told the report: “I used to receive messages of nudes that other umpires would send to me.  
  
“And umpires during games would inappropriately touch me, like when we’re umpiring together and things like that.  
  
“That’s what made me quit.”

Another was quoted as saying: “I openly overheard a group of guys talking about my boobs at training one night … I was walking up the stairs, and I overheard them being literally like, ‘Oh my god, have you seen (her) tits?’”  
  
The report makes 11 recommendations to create safe conditions for recruiting and retaining female umpires, including better education, more accessible reporting tools, adoption of inclusive change rooms and improved coaching.  
  
Females represent only 10.8 per cent of umpires nationally and, as of 2019, 2.6 per cent at AFL level, despite AFLW triggering an enormous uplift in player participation.  
  
The AFL did not explain why the report had not been released.  
  
But in a statement the league said: “The report has been a valuable resource for our team in prioritising the key initiatives to accelerate the growth in women and girls taking on umpiring roles”.

Victoria is football’s heartland but it has been slow to increase the number of female umpires, adding only 18 per cent from 2015-19.  
  
Eleni Glouftsis, the AFL’s only female field umpire, is frustrated by the lack of progress and wrote a scathing foreword in the report.  
  
“In reading this research, I felt frustrated that girls and women in umpiring roles are still facing the same obstacles and challenges that I faced almost 16 years ago,” Glouftsis said.  
  
“I had hoped things would have improved. They certainly should have.”

The first female AFL goal umpire, Chelsea Roffey, said the report made her “blood boil”.  
  
“Looking back, scenarios that related to my gender ranged from those I regarded as innocuous, waved away as signs of ignorance rather than ill-intent, through to those that made my blood boil,” Roffey said.  
  
“This research legitimises and reflects many of the thoughts and emotions I’ve experienced. This report identifies the need for meaningful action if female umpire numbers are to increase.  
  
“But its recommendations not only improve the landscape for girls and women; they serve to make umpiring a truly inclusive space, a better space for all. In doing so, they bring umpiring in line with the expectations of broader society and best practice.”

The AFL this year banned elite players from showing dissent by throwing their arms out in frustration at decisions as part of a crackdown on respect for umpires, citing a shortage of 6000 umpires at grassroots.  
  
But this research project, which received ethical approval from the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee, reveals the true depths of what is a full-blown national crisis.  
  
Last week News Corp revealed umpires in Queensland threatened to boycott because a player was not suspended or sent to the tribunal for touching an umpire in 2021.  
  
Leaked documents showed the AFL signed off on the Match Review Officer’s decision to set the player free, only months before it was determined to have Greater Western Sydney captain Toby Greene suspended for six matches for a similar incident.

**AFL STATEMENT:**  
  
We are committed to ensuring that women and girls of all ages can take part in our game in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment, and while we have seen a doubling of the number of girls and women playing football since AFLW was introduced, we have not experienced a similar growth in the umpiring ranks. To better understand this trend, we commissioned a report to look at all the elements that lead to girls and women continuing to be under-represented in umpiring at all levels.  
  
As part of that ‘Girls and Women in Australian Football Umpiring study’, current and former umpires were interviewed and provided valuable feedback on all the physical, cultural and environmental barriers that impacted the pathway for girls and women umpiring at community and the elite level.  The important findings and recommendations of the report have formed the basis for a number of initiatives that have been included in the ‘Women and Girls Game Development Action Plan’ which is in its final stages of completion.  
  
The initiatives in the plan are designed to increase representation of women and girls in all parts or our game from players to umpires to coaches and administrators and are aimed at ensuring a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for women and girls, including to lift the number of women umpires to 40%.  
  
In order to achieve that growth, we will introduce a number of policy directives including developing and publishing the ‘Community football guiding principles for equity’, which will comprise initiatives such as umpiring appointments, access to multi-gender or shared space facilities,  establishing female mentoring programs to accelerate the pathway for women and girls and helping to achieve more gender-balanced leadership in all community football leagues and clubs.  
  
The report has been a valuable resource for our team in prioritising the key initiatives to accelerate the growth in women and girls taking on umpiring roles across the country and ensuring we have a safe and welcoming pathway that allows women and girls to progress from community to AFL and AFLW level.

&gt; However, in Batgirls she's in the book just to prop Steph and Cass. From being an active hero being able to do everything herself, or even the all-knowing Oracle, she's reduced to cooking dinner for the other Batgirls, giving them nerdy scooters that they abandon immediately, and being constantly ignored by them. She's portrayed as an old, pathetic suburban mom in Batgiirls. At the same time, however, in Nightwing, she and Dick have a cool young couple vibe, and she's treated as a fun young adult, completely competent, ordering the Titans, saving their dog from armed robbers, and being able to escape kidnapping. It's like she's two completely different characters in these two books, with maybe 20 years apart between them.

Yeah, I think it would be less muddied if they didn't change her back to her a peppy teenager when New 52 happened and left her character progression intact the way that they did with Dick, Tim, Jason, and Damian.  It's low-key embarrassing to me that even a brand-new character like Damian had his character history respected, while an O.G. all-star like Babs was just callously regressed to the character she was thirty years ago.  The Babs in ""Batgirls"" is the way Babs should be, imo, because it's the version of Babs which acknowledges her history of character development.  Young peppy Babs should be saved for flashback stories, the way we save young peppy Dick for flashback stories (and use old peppy Dick in current continuity lol :-P).

&gt; Anyway, I believe I'm not the only one who hated Babs' portrayal in Batgirls, because the book seems to be doing a rapid course-correcting

You keep deferring to general opinion.  An appeal to popularity is a fallacy.  I'm not telling you that your opinion is invalid, so I don't need to be told that other people share the opinion.  I disagree with it, no matter how many people agree with it.  I'm not telling you you're wrong to feel the way you do.  What's going to convince me you position is more reasonable than I currently consider it is a well-reasoned argument, not an appeal to popularity.  With all due respect.  :)

&gt; Cass and Steph should be competent enough to do the job without her. 

One second you're arguing she should be in the book more and be more like old-school Babs, the next second you're arguing that she should be in the book less and be less like old-school Babs... I don't see a consistent point, with all due respect.  :)

&gt; As for the way Babs, Dick, and the rest of the batfamily were portrayed in Detective comics - that's a different can of worms, and I won't be surprised if that's part of the reason Tamaski is leaving the book after only one year writing it.

Dick Grayson- first Robin, grew up in the circus and he, like his parents, was an acrobat. One day, the trapeze were sabotaged by a mobster in Gotham and his parents fell to their deaths as he watched. Bruce Wayne (Batman) sympathized with the traumatized 9 year old and adopted him. 

Barbara Gordon- basically like, she’s inspired by Batman to clean up Gotham and her dad is commissioner Gordon. She does solo stuff til Batman kinda trusts her enough to work with her. 

Jason Todd- street rat from the slums of Gotham, tried to steal the tires off the bat mobile when it was parked in an alley and Batman caught him. Long story short, he takes Jason in and Jason eventually becomes Robin. He’s angry, more tough on criminals than he should be because of trauma from living on the streets, and eventually, his hotheadedness gets him killed by the joker. Edit- Jason stans can analyze all they want, this is JUST a general description. 

Tim Drake- he’s a genius, smarter than Bruce in my opinion, and when he was like a really little kid, he went to the circus and met Dick the night his parents died. Soon after, he started noticing Robin having similar moves to the acrobats from that night and connects the dots and figures out Batman and Robin’s identities. After Jason died, he approached Bruce and asked to be Robin because “Batman needs a Robin” (meaning, Bruce went apeshit with grief and was a menace to society up until that point). Eventually, Bruce agrees. Edit- ah yes, he is also rich, as someone uselessly pointed out. 

Stephanie brown- she comes in around the time that Tim does, her dad is a criminal and she wants to take him down so she dons the alter ego “spoiler” and Batman is having nONE of it. However, Robin (Tim) takes a liking to her and kinda trains with her, she has a teenage pregnancy thing and gives the kid up for adoption, half way through the pregnancy she starts dating Tim, Batman finally accepts her. 
ThEN, Tim runs away or whatever, and she becomes Robin for a brief time. Very brief (she starts a gang war) and then she goes back to spoiler. 

Cassandra Cain- abused child assassin, she wasn’t taught to speak, her dad was an abusive asshole but then again so were like.. half of these batfamily kids’ dads, her mom is Lady Shiva and she’s literally a better fighter than Batman. Eventually she switched sides and Bruce takes her in, they help her with speaking and signing, and now she’s a very happy, sweet, caring person. 

Kate Kane- technically Bruce’s cousin. She was an army brat, her and her sister were kidnapped, sister died, Kate Kane took that personally and eventually became a Vigilante. She’s known for her nice sarcasm, lesbianism, and bright red hair  in costume. Edit- because some people are petty, to clarify, she is also a redhead under her wig 🤩


Damian Wayne- bio son of Bruce and Thalia Al Ghul (supervillain and daughter of THE crazy ass evil cult leader Ra’s Al Ghul), he was raised from birth to be the perfect assassin, and was meant to eventually take over the league of assassins and be Ra’s Al Ghul’s heir. Eventually, at the age of 10 he is revealed to Bruce and put in his care where he is “reprogrammed” to like.. not be an evil murder baby, and becomes Robin. It’s important to note that Dick Grayson was Damian’s Batman, as Bruce soon after meeting Damian, was lost in a time stream. 

Duke Thomas- just Google him bc I’ve been getting mixed opinions on what his correct origin is. I’ve looked on Wikipedia, consulted my own library of comics with Duke, and asked my friends what they though it was, and we also came up with different things (with proof) so it’s gonna be an issue of indecisive comic writers, sorry.

Here's a PDF with all 12 keys written out for you. **Print this out.** Do the exercise above in all 12 keys.

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/kes4f3p1mclddrf/Closed-Inversions-as-Letters.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kes4f3p1mclddrf/Closed-Inversions-as-Letters.pdf?dl=0)

**Figure out your own fingerings.** That's part of the exercise. I only included first example to show how you're supposed to move up the fingerboard (as opposed to finding the inversions in the same position). This helps you to ""hear"" the inversions better (since they're always rising). Some of the fingerings get tricky with the flat 5 and sharp 5. That's part of the exercise. Figure out what works best for YOU.

**Use a metronome, and GO SLOWLY.** This exercise should take you a year or so to build up speed. This is NOT about speed. This is about finding the inversions, HEARING the inversions, and UNDERSTANDING the function of the scale degrees. GO SLOW, but use the metronome to keep you on track. This is not a speed drill. This exercise works you BRAIN. Don't be frustrated if this exercise takes a few weeks/months/years to really lock in. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

**SING the scale degrees** (1,3,5,7... 3,5,7,1... 5,7,1,3... etc...) while you're doing the exercise. This will help you discover how the function of the degrees changes as the chord qualities change. (Or you can sing the note names (C,E,G,B) if you're just trying to memorize the chord spellings, or fretboard.) But singing the DEGREES (1,3,5,7) will help you more with THEORY.

**(OPTIONAL EXERCISE)** At first it's best to practice this as above: inversions moving up the neck. BUT once you learn them, you can also practice all the chord QUALIITES in one position (in one inversion). So:  


Root Position, All at 3rd fret  
C Maj7  
C Dom7  
C minor7  
C min7b5 (ø)  
C Aug7 (+)  


First Inversion, All w pinky on 7th fret  
C Maj7  
C Dom7  
C minor7  
C min7b5 (ø)  
C Aug7 (+)  


Second Inversion, All at 10th fret, etc..  
Third Inversion, all at 14th fret, etc...  


(You'll notice, **if you printed out the PDF I linked above, you can just read ACROSS the lines of the grid to find these spellings, instead of straight DOWN the page.** The grid works both ways, like a spreadsheet)

\---

**Once you can do these exercises above with ACCURACY and CONFIDENCE** (after about 6 weeks or so), check out these Damian Erskine videos, and practice finding these inversions IN ONE POSITION by reading chord charts for jazz standards. (e.g. try to find all the chord tones for Autumn Leaves in the first 5 frets. Then the same exercise from frets 5-10.)

## Peer-reviewed analysis of 2,500 pets finds vegan dogs visit the vet less often and require fewer medications

Vegan diets are healthier and safer for dogs than conventional meat-based diets, according to the largest study to date, as long as they are nutritionally complete.

The diet and health of more than 2,500 dogs were followed over a year using surveys completed by their owners. These assessed seven general indicators of health, such as multiple visits to the vets, and 22 common illnesses.

The researchers found that, for example, almost half the dogs fed conventional meat-based diets required non-routine medication but only a third of the dogs fed vegan diets did so. A separate study in 2021 found that [dogs found vegan diets just as tasty](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253292) as regular dog food.

Some of the dogs in the study were fed raw meat diets and these were marginally more healthy than the vegan dogs overall. However, this may have been because they were on average a year younger.

The damaging impact of western societies’ overconsumption of [meat on the environment](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) and [people’s health](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/02/eating-meat-raises-risk-of-heart-disease-diabetes-and-pneumonia) has become clear in recent years, as well as rising concerns over how farm animals are treated.

There are about 470m pet dogs in the world and an increasing number of pet owners are now considering [changing their animal’s diets](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/18/dog-vegan-cats-killers-plant-based-diet-pets-food) as well. About $9bn (£6.9bn) of vegan pet food was sold worldwide in 2020 and the sector is growing fast.

“Our study is by far the largest study published to date,” said Prof Andrew Knight, at the University of Winchester, UK, and who led the study. “It revealed that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs are nutritionally sound vegan diets.”

“The raw meat diet appeared to have marginally better health outcomes,” he said. “But those dogs were significantly younger, which gives them a health advantage. A substantial body of prior studies have also shown that raw meat diets are much more contaminated with pathogenic bacteria and parasites.”

The study, [published in the journal Plos One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265662), analysed surveys completed by 2,536 dog owners about a single animal. Just over half ate conventional meat-based diets, a third were fed raw meat and 13% had vegan diets.

Among the findings were that 17% of dogs on conventional diets had four or more visits to the vet over the course of a year, compared with 9% for those on vegan diets and 8% for those on raw meat diets. The percentage of dogs reported to have suffered from health disorders was 49% for the conventional diet, 43% for the raw meat diet and 36% for the vegan diet.

Survey-based studies cannot reveal the reasons for their results but Knight suggested weight problems might be an important factor: “One of the most common health problems for dogs is being overweight or obese and it is unfortunately common that when we do tests on the commercial meat-based diets, there are more calories.”

“We also know the health hazards associated with overconsumption of meat and dairy for people and it’s often the same ingredients,” he said, although in some countries pet food can contain meat deemed not fit for human consumption.

Further research is needed to confirm the findings. “The key limitation of our study is that we didn’t have a population of animals locked up in a research facility and fed one specific diet without any alteration,” Knight said. “We studied what real dogs in normal homes ate and their health outcomes. It gives us a good indication as to what the outcomes are for dogs in the real world.”

Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said: “There is a lot of ongoing research in the field of vegan dog diets and this paper adds to the body of evidence supporting its benefits. However, there is currently a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of feeding a vegan diet to a large number of dogs over many years, so we look forward to seeing further research on whether this can meet a dog’s dietary requirements over the long term.”

“Although we would not recommend it, it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but owners would need to take expert veterinary advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease,” she said.

Most of the respondents to the survey were in the UK and other European countries and more than 90% were women, but Knight said this was unlikely to have caused a systematic bias. Knight, who follows a vegan diet himself but does not own a dog, devised and led the peer-reviewed study, which was funded by the charity ProVeg.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1649977332.0,,False,0.0,{},i4rhu6d,True,t3_u3toz7,False,t1_i4rhu6d,True,t3_u3toz7,/r/veganscience/comments/u3toz7/vegan_diets_are_healthier_and_safer_for_dogs/i4rhu6d/,1655592543.0,2.0,False,True,False,veganscience,t5_31dm3,r/veganscience,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's a Berklee Press book called ""Playing The Changes: Bass"" which has a methodical approach to learning chord-scale theory. (Some people like chord-scale theory, some people don't).

But it bascially gives you exercises to identify ""key centers"" of certain common passages, then using scales to solo over multiple chords with one scale.

For example:

Here are the changes to Kenny Dorham's Blue Bossa:

[https://standardrepertoire.com/blue-bossa.html](https://standardrepertoire.com/blue-bossa.html)

You can play C-minor over the first 8 bars

Db Major over bars 9-12

And C-minor over bars 13-16

So instead of focusing on every chord as it goes by, you instead focus on the ""key center.""

There are, however limitations to the sound this technique gives you.

**Method 2) Chord Tones (a.k.a arpeggios)**

Learn the chord tones, and INVERSIONS for Maj7, Minor7, Dom7, Min7b5, (and augmented &amp; diminished)

Practice LEARNING your arpeggios by looking at a jazz standard, playing four notes per chord, and finding the next nearest note for the next chord (not always starting on the root).

I’m not sure if you’re aware and just trying to be extra sly about it, but both of those have already happened. Kong Kenan and Damian Wayne (although I suppose you could argue against Ra’s Al Ghul and thus Damian being Middle Eastern since his lineage is a bit nebulous) respectively. 

But to your point, the only one I would bat an eye at would be Superman and only because him being raised in the farmlands of Kansas and growing up in America is so central to his character. And really all that means is diverging from it would require some rewriting. And THAT’S just with regards to his nationality and resulting culture, the color of his skin should matter fuck all except inasmuch as his ethnicity might have affected his upbringing and how he interacts with the world and vice versa. 

But for James Bond, the fact that he’s British is obviously a key factor in his character, but I don’t see why race would make it seem less like Bond. Sure, it might take time to adjust, but I don’t see why an Idris Elba Bond would be any more of an adjustment than any other actor change.

The point of a brand is, is that you need to stand for something. When they click on your profile, they need to know who you are, what you stand for, what’s unique about you and how can they help you grow what you already have

From their perspective, there’s thousands of talented people who have good music, but what makes you different from them? :)

The former has the very obvious &gt;!""why did the police believe that Machi could be able to not only kill a grown-ass man, but also shooting him with a weapon that can canonically harm your shoulder"". Things get worse once you remember that Machi was supposedly blind (but then this was disproved). I can accept that this was written as an attempt to show that the law does not care about common sense and only relies on evidence, which is a major point of the Jury System in 4-4. However, there are still some glaring flaws outside Machi, such as how Daryan was able to drag two bodies to the platform, with a wounded shoulder and without being seen? How the hell is a band so focused on a performance that they totally miss a gunshot? If LeTouse knew that the cocoon was inside the guitar, why would he investigate the Gavinners' room (or Lamiroir's, I don't remember) during the only time he cannot find the guitar? There are many more flaws in this case, but I kinda like it, it's my ""guilty pleasure"" episode tbf.!&lt;

[],False,,dabadabadood,1609838545.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4c2jrebu,False,False,"The Catholic Church has contributed to society through its social doctrine which has guided leaders to promote social justice and providing care to the sick and poor. In orations such as his Sermon on the Mount and stories such as The Good Samaritan, Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. Such teachings are the foundation of Catholic Church involvement in social justice, hospitals and health care.

Today the Roman Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of health care services in the world.[286] It has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals, with 65 percent of them located in developing countries.[287] In 2010, the Church's Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers said that the Church manages 26% of the world's health care facilities.[288] The Church's involvement in health care has ancient origins.

Fourth century	
Historians record that, prior to Christianity, the ancient world left little trace of any organized charitable effort.[289] Christian charity and the practice of feeding and clothing the poor, visiting prisoners, supporting widows and orphan children has had sweeping impact.[290]

Albert Jonsen, University of Washington historian of medicine, says ""the second great sweep of medical history begins at the end of the fourth century, with the founding of the first Christian hospital at Caesarea in Cappadocia, and concludes at the end of the fourteenth century, with medicine well ensconced in the universities and in the public life of the emerging nations of Europe.""[291] After the death of Eusebios in 370 and the election of Basil as bishop of Caesarea, Basil established the first formal soup kitchen, hospital, homeless shelter, hospice, poorhouse, orphanage, reform center for thieves, women's center for those leaving prostitution and many other ministries. Basil was personally involved and invested in the projects and process giving all of his personal wealth to fund the ministries. Basil himself would put on an apron and work in the soup kitchen. These ministries were given freely regardless of religious affiliation. Basil refused to make any discrimination when it came to people who needed help saying that ""the digestive systems of the Jew and the Christian are indistinguishable.""[292] ""...there is a striking resemblance between [Basil's] ideals and those of modern times. ...certainly he was the most modern among the pioneers of monasticism, and for this reason, if for none other, his work has a permanent interest...""[293]

Charity has now become a universal practice.[294] Christianity played a key role in the building and maintaining of hospitals in the Byzantine Empire. Many hospitals were built and maintained by bishops in their respective prefectures. Hospitals were usually built near or around churches, and great importance was laid on the idea of healing through salvation.[295] When medicine failed, doctors would ask their patients to pray. This often involved icons of Cosmas and Damian, patron saints of medicine and doctors. Christianity also played a key role in propagating the idea of charity. Medicine was made, according to Oregon State University historian, Gary Ferngren (professor of ancient Greek and Rome history with a speciality in ancient medicine) ""accessible to all and... simple"". In the actual practice of medicine there is evidence of Christian influence. John Zacharias Aktouarios recommends the use of Holy Water mixed with a pellitory plant to act as a way to cure epilepsy.[296]

Medieval period
The Catholic Church established a hospital system in Medieval Europe that was different from the merely reciprocal hospitality of the Greeks and family-based obligations of the Romans. These hospitals were established to cater to ""particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age"", according to historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse.[297]

The Fugger Family from Augsburg, Germany who were bankers, 500 years ago founded one of the first social housing projects in the world, which exists till today.[298][299][300]",True,False,,,,,0.0,1649517983.0,,False,0.0,{},i41lwil,False,t3_tzr6y7,False,t1_i41lwil,True,t1_i41lkry,/r/PublicFreakout/comments/tzr6y7/10_year_old_palestinian_standing_in_front_of_a/i41lwil/,1655615472.0,-2.0,False,True,False,PublicFreakout,t5_2yrq6,r/PublicFreakout,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

minimal risk of brain damblage. somewhat risk of other injuries, similar to other contact sports.

&gt;2) do I need to be fit or “big” to join? Im 5’10 73kg quite skinny. Do you get strength/fitness training at bjj or do you have to already be fit/string to join?

you don't need to be fit or big to join, but getting fit and big will make you better at BJJ and it will reduce your susceptibility to injury. you are indeed quite skinny, and a lifting regimen that includes squats, deadlifts, and caloric surplus would benefit you greatly. no need to wait to start - you can do both at the same time, even though half of this reddit will tell you that's impossible without steroids. 

&gt;3) I started gym a couple months ago and have made some decent progress. Is it possible to go train at the gym and do bjj at the same time? I feel like gym sessions will make the next bjj session super hard to perform or vice versa. Lemme know if any of you guys are doing both and how you cope with it. :)

yes. i lift heavy twice a week and train BJJ six days a week. you might have to reduce the frequency and/or intensity of your training sessions at first, but over time your body will adapt to handle both. the 4 key factors are to increase your training volume slowly over time, sleep as much as possible, eat a lot of high quality food, and drink plenty of water.

&gt;4) is bjj a good place to make friends and increase social skills? I struggle a lot with making friends and I’m pretty shy/introverted but am looking for ways to open up and get better at talking. Is bjj a good opportunity for that?

it can be. most of my friends are from BJJ at this point.

&gt;5) is the sport effective for street fights or general physical altercations? Also I heard the sport is mainly take downs or whatever. Do we also learn general fighting practices such as punches and kicks? (Sorry for noob question lol)

there are no punches or kicks in BJJ, but it can be very effective for a street fight. watch someone like damian maia to see how BJJ can work in the context of a fight with punches and kicks.  

&gt;6) not really a question but any tips or advice for someone new would be appreciated. :)

For Dick, I feel like it's overdone to have him just be the smiley flirty one, and Cass tends to get pushed into the ""emotional support Asian"" role.  I guess what's most important to me is nuance and everyone having their own motivations. 

I like angst and whump!  I want to see everyone put through the wringer!  Ideally they also get comforted afterward.  I also like Dick's relationships with non-batfam characters, esp. the Teen Titans. My favorite Dick pairing is DickKory, and my Cass pairing is StephCass (but with drama!  Too many people just make them generic soft wlw, but I like a little energy.  They've both got plenty of trauma to work from!).

I love Robin!Jason stories!  The contrast between the hurt but hopeful kid Jason and his angry and bitter adult self is so nice and tragic. 

I'm pretty neutral on batcest. I know a lot of people who hate it with a passion, and others who dig it. I've read my fair share of it, but I don't like them to feel too brother-y in this stories, if that makes sense (a little hypocritical of me). 

My favorite platonic relationship is almost certainly Dick and Damian, but I also love any story about Bruce and his kids, especially when he's properly emotionally repressed and incompetent and bad at fathering but trying to be better.   That's my key for Bruce stories!  I don't like him too nice and sensitive, but a desire to be better and understand his family is great for me.

Overall, this is a pretty solid roster - most of the big names are here, a bunch of the fan-favorites with a couple more obscure picks for extra kick, most of the picks here make sense.

...but I have some queries &amp; suggestions:  
\~It makes sense to see a good chunk of the Justice League, but it's odd to be missing Martian Manhunter and especially Aquaman - both members of the iconic JLA roster, J'onn is beloved thanks to Carl Lumbly's portrayal in Justice League &amp; JL:Unlimited, and Aquaman has had a renaissance of his own in the last 5-10 years with Geoff Johns AND Jason Mamoa both giving him big pushes in the comics &amp; the films (mini-series from Thundercats Roar alums non-withstanding)  
\~I get that Street Fighter is easily Capcom's favorite child -especially with Street Fighter II being its own series over SF1, Alpha, III, etc.- but it admittedly feels a little weird to not have Ken Masters in the roster  
\~Lord Raptor &amp; Jon Talbain would both be welcome Darkstalkers reps, but Morrigan still feels a little overplayed presently - I get she's the most popular Darkstalkers character, but there are already a few Shoto/All-Rounder characters just on the Capcom side (plus several who'd fit that mold for the DC side), plus the Darkstalkers roster has G.O.A.T. contenders across the board so it'd be nice for Felicia or Hsien-Ko to return, or maybe have another fighter make their 3D debut: Q-Bee, Rikuo, Anita (kid or teenager) or maybe even a fleshed-out Marionette (she was in the PS2 collection as a secret Mirror-Match fighter)  
\~Lastly, it makes some sense for X, Zero &amp; Sigma to come back, but I worry people would be hung up on A\] all three being key players in MVCI, and B\] all three characters are only from the Mega Man X games, which is a pity considering all the sub-series (Classic, X, Legends, Battle Network/StarForce, Zero/ZX and a few spinoffs) have great characters to pull from - not just Mega Man/Rock and Tron, but also Bass, Duo, Axl, Marino, Volnutt, Ashe, Fefnir, and a bunch of the NetNavis, Robot Masters, Reploids, Mavericks and more!",True,False,,,,,0.0,1648853024.0,,False,0.0,{},i31jjem,False,t3_ttx41w,False,t1_i31jjem,True,t3_ttx41w,/r/capcom/comments/ttx41w/how_would_yall_feel_if_this_was_next_versus_game/i31jjem/,1655648910.0,1.0,False,True,False,capcom,t5_2sjy2,r/capcom,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For current DC: 
The main Batman series is about to start a new story arc so that should be a good jumping on point. Titans United was fairly solid all the way through and has a lot of the classic teen titan characters you know teaming up again as adults

The current Robin series with Damian that is just about to end is really great and has amazing character moments. Might be important to know that all the Batman books take place in the wake of a certain characters death that happens at the end of Tom King’s Batman. So that may confuse you.

Let’s talk about track records. Specifically, my track record. No, I’m not gonna be talking about my Final 4 appearance, my Conference Championship or anything like that (not yet anyway). To be specificier, my track record in CPR. Unlike almost every other coach in the league, I enjoy CPR. Why? Because I love recruiting people with something to prove.  
  
People like Damian Newley. The DII sensation emerged as one of this team’s star players in my first season coaching. Like Nicholas Delarboulas, who was cut by not one, but two teams before winding up in New York. Coaches Heinrichs and Hail, the people who said he wasn’t good enough for their programs, ended up watching him contribute to a Final 4 in his senior season. Or what about Ben Spillier? He went from CPR walk-on to starter on a conference-winning team. But the title wasn’t his proudest moment. It was trouncing Coach Plok, who cut him from the team, from the National Tournament in an unforgettable blowout. Every single one of my teams at SJU has had a CPR player play key minutes. And by key minutes, I’m talking at least 15 minutes a game.   
  
I can promise you that you’ll be playing at least 15 minutes a game. In fact, you’ll be playing more than 15 minutes a game for SJU because I think you’re a starting caliber player. In fact, I promise you a starting role at St. John’s. I see you as the perfect compliment in our front court to Jeff Taylor and Christopher Dickerson. Spacing is key in today’s game and you provide a ton of space for our offense to function. As a great 3 point shooter (by any standard, let alone that of a big man), you’ll be feasting on pick-and-pops with McGonagill. But I see you as a spot up shooter as well. Jeff Taylor is our star player and defenses will be keying in on him night in and night out. As the defense collapses inward when he gets the ball, there’s bound to be some open 3 point shots to shoot for you. And Taylor, being unusually blessed with the “passer” trait as a center, will certainly find you. But the inverse will work as well. With a “62” passing rating, you’re bound to find Dickerson or Taylor on the post mismatches, or even McGonagill on cuts. Basketball is a beautiful game. And passing is the most beautiful way to play the world’s most beautiful game. With good passers at guard (McGonagill) and even forward (you and Taylor), St. John’s offense is bound to be a harmonious symphony truly worthy of Carnegie Hall.  
  
But not all promises are kept. Indeed in this world we live in today, liars and con men are all too common. In fact, some of them are in the league today, shown by their low loyalty rating. But that’s not a worry with me. I’ve never broken a promise. I’ve never cut a scholarship. I haven’t even cut a PWO. This is yet another one of my track records. A track record of loyalty and keeping my word.  
  
As well, New York is much closer and more convenient for your family to get to compared to Las Vegas. It’s a 2 hour flight to NYC compared to about a 4 hour flight to get to Las Vegas. That means cheaper flights and easier ways for your family to watch you at home. But it’s easier to watch you at SJU away from home. With the ACC having teams around Tennessee like Duke, North Carolina State or Clemson, they can make a road trip to see you play in the South you grew up in.  
  
Another perk of SJU is the Battle for the Holy Grail. We play several fellow Catholic schools like TCU, Creighton, Xavier and yes, Gonzaga. This means that for your final season at school, you have the chance to get back at the coach who cut you. And we can bea Gonzaga. After all, I'm sure you remember losing to us last year, no?",True,False,,,,,0.0,1647644882.0,,1647723479.0,0.0,{},i17sfrh,False,t3_tgsy8p,False,t1_i17sfrh,False,t1_i16yo2l,/r/NCBCA/comments/tgsy8p/2064_cut_player_recruiting/i17sfrh/,1655734040.0,1.0,False,True,False,NCBCA,t5_3lc8b,r/NCBCA,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This post [covers it well.](https://www.basketballnews.com/stories/the-catalyst-assessing-why-spencer-dinwiddie-should-be-coveted-nba-free-agent)

&gt; Dinwiddie is a premier advantage creator. His 2019-20 showing underlined his value to an offense, as he averaged 20.6 points, 6.8 assists and 3.5 rebounds on 54% True Shooting percentage. Kevin Durant’s year-long absence and Kyrie Irving’s injury struggles left the Brooklyn Nets low on initiators. That thrust Dinwiddie into an outsized lead ball-handling role, though one that enabled him to exhibit the depths of his entire game and illuminate why he’d provide considerable impact to potential suitors moving forward.

&gt; According to Synergy, only 11 players logged more isolation possessions than him in 2019-20. Despite the mammoth volume (205 possessions), he ranked in the 69th percentile in points per possession (0.951), which was seventh among the 12 players meeting that threshold. James Harden, Damian Lillard, Kawhi Leonard, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul and Jayson Tatum were the only players to finish above him. Dinwiddie blends both usage and production in a manner emulated by a select number of preeminent offensive orchestrators. 

&gt; Contriving buckets out of thin air is a rare and critical commodity in the NBA. Fitting that criteria is Dinwiddie, who also sat near the top of the league in pick-and-roll possessions two seasons ago. Over 48% of his offense came via pick-and-rolls and he was in the 61st percentile. (His 667 pNr possessions slated fifth overall behind Trae Young, Donovan Mitchell, Lillard and Doncic).

&gt; Commandeering such substantial workloads and conserving relatively efficient numbers is a skill in itself. The volume signifies a malleable approach to creation that prevents defenses from keying in one certain tendency and eliminating it to curtail functionality in those actions. Pick-and-roll initiation is typically central to offense, as is individual creation. Dinwiddie offers both to many teams lacking those traits in a free-agent class short on star talent.

&gt; Among the top-30 players in total assists in 2019-20, just Westbrook (93%) and Harden (92.4%) had a higher percentage of their assists resulting in threes or shots at the rim than Dinwiddie (92.1%), according to PBPStats.

Well, we saw the departure of Normal Powell and Torrey Craig, that could've saved a few wins. 

But we also saw the emergence of Wendell Carter Jr and the improved play and return of Jalen Suggs. Along with that we have Corey Kispert entering the starting lineup for the Wizards on a consistent basis. 

Here's some stuff about Wendell Carter Jr: 

&gt; After a stellar month — that included being named one of the nominees for the Eastern Conference Player of the Month in February — Carter has established himself as an indispensable part of the Magic’s success, as limited as it might be.
&gt; Wendell Carter has been at the center of much of the Orlando Magic’s success. In the third quarter of the season, he emerged as a consistent rock for Orlando to stand on.
&gt; 
&gt; In a season of inconsistency, Carter has been the bedrock for this team. The third quarter of the season only solidified how good Carter has been and can be to help the Magic improve.
&gt; 
&gt; Carter is our MVP for the third quarter of the season.
&gt; 
&gt; In the third quarter of the season, Carter averaged a team-high 17.2 points per game while shooting 57.8-percent from the floor. He grabbed a team-high 10.3 rebounds per game. Carter was a consistent producer for the team in that time too.
&gt; 
&gt; He scored fewer than 10 points just once in the third quarter of the season and fewer than 15 points in just seven of the team’s 15 games.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly than that, Carter remained a defensive stalwart for the team.
&gt; 
&gt; Orlando was not the picture of defensive perfection in the third quarter of the season, giving up 111.7 points per 100 possessions. But with Carter on the floor, the Magic gave up 109.2 points per 100 possessions. That was the best mark by regular rotation players (R.J. Hampton led the way but played in only seven games in the third quarter of the season because of a sprained MCL).
&gt; 
&gt; This is what Carter was known for with the Bulls. He was a stalwart and versatile defender, equally able to block shots and defend the rim as he was to position himself to cover on pick and rolls. The Magic have only really started to unleash Carter’s defensive potential. And his versatility has enabled him to play power forward for much of the year.

Grant Williams has emerged as an elite role player IRL for the surging Celtics: 

&gt; An underrated ingredient in the Boston Celtic's defensive juggernaut and their run up the East standings: Williams doing enough on offense to play major minutes as Boston's younger P.J. Tucker. Williams can guard every position -- key to Boston's switchy scheme.
&gt; 
&gt; The goal of switching is to force teams into attacking one-on-one; only Al Horford has defended more isolations than Williams, per Second Spectrum. Teams average a measly 0.684 points when an isolation against Williams leads to a shot or turnover -- 10th lowest among 256 players who have guarded at least 50 isolations. Attack him at your peril.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams has drained a career-best 44% from deep at higher volume, and his accuracy is no longer confined to the corners; Williams has hit 38% from above the break, and his comfort out there allows him to function more as a screener and playmaker instead of a stationary shooter -- adding spice to a Boston offense that thrives when its bigs facilitate.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams' shooting has allowed Boston to keep one true center -- Robert Williams III or Horford -- on the floor at all times instead of trading size for shooting.
&gt; 
&gt; But 3-and-D isn't enough. Role players need to slice into the lane when defenders run them off the arc, and make the next play. Williams has made major strides there.
&gt; 
&gt; He's decisive, and a good passer. He's finishing with more oomph.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is shooting 75% at the rim -- by far the best mark of his career. Boston has scored 1.155 points per possession when Williams shoots out of a drive, or dishes to a teammate who launches -- 24th among 296 players with at least 50 drives, per Second Spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt; He can even run an impromptu pick-and-roll:
&gt; 
&gt; Williams mashes little guys in the post on switches.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about what this means for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown: if every player on the floor -- even the alleged ""weakest"" link -- is a threat with the ball, stars have an easier time hunting mismatches. Every teammate is a potential screening partner. (Keep an eye on the Derrick White-Tatum two-man game when teams stash point guards on White.)

Those blue gems are perhaps the most valuable collectable resource in the game, you'll start to be mostly limited by your access to blue gems as you progress from here on. Anything to level 10 is fine, especially for Ezio it's amazing, but from there on he doesn't gain much of anything with each level up. In general making a decision on which SM is your most powerful vs which SM gets the most benefit from upgrading is key, and then focusing on that SM only and not straying from that path is often the most efficient way to use blue gems. 

Turner to level 30 and promoted is your first big long term goal, and the most critical one out of all of them. Meanwhile getting Jr up to level 20 promoted would be great, and level 30 promoted later on after you're done with upgrading Turner. For me it took until ML 165 to get Turner upgraded, it would have been much better to focus on him from very early on. Mr and Mrs Goodman should follow with their promotions shortly after Jr. Getting them to 30 promoted is quite reasonable, 40 promoted requires a lot of grinding at the bottom of ML.

You'll get a much bigger upgrade to Ezio's output if you just upgrade Chester and run him in the best shaft during Ezio's active, so it would be really tempting to try to get Chester to level 20 and promoted, and to 30 promoted after the Goodmans are done. Also I wouldn't be against rolling for Gordon in this case, but in events you can switch between Gordon and Jr for your Ezio runs so you don't absolutely need Gordon.

For green gems I'd go for Steiner, Sue, Damian, Gordon, and Lilly in roughly that order. If you buy Aurora then Lilly becomes kinda useless.

[],False,,SaulKD,1295408557.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4qqs3,False,False,"Turning Point USA, the youth group led by pro-Trump activist Charlie Kirk, sought to entice investors last year with a new foray in the culture wars: an academy aimed at students failed by schools “poisoning our youth with anti-American ideas.”

A company in the early stages of realizing Kirk’s vision was anticipating millions in revenue from Turning Point Academy — part of an effort to market K-12 curriculum to families seeking an “America-first education.”

A document circulated within StrongMind, an education firm in Arizona where programmers had begun work on the project, noted plans to open the online academy by the fall of 2022 and assessed its “potential to generate over $40MM in gross revenue at full capacity (10K students).”

The firm’s plans disintegrated last week amid a Washington Post investigation and backlash from StrongMind employees concerned about the prospect of Turning Point-directed lesson plans. A key subcontractor tapped to prepare course material also backed out after learning that Kirk’s group was the ultimate client. The 28-year-old activist, who boasts 1.7 million Twitter followers, has championed former president Donald Trump’s baseless claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection and has scorned demands for racial justice that followed the 2020 murder of a Black man at the hands of the Minneapolis police, calling George Floyd a “scumbag.”

Kirk still intends to open the academy, though with other partners, said a spokesman, Andrew Kolvet, who called the agreement with StrongMind “nonbinding and nonexclusive.”

The early blueprint for Turning Point Academy — laid out in detail for the first time in documents and chat logs reviewed by The Washington Post — points to the growing market for education and media serving families disgruntled with public schools, a flash point in many communities and a key issue on the campaign trail. The quest to raise revenue by allowing families to bypass traditional schools and buy curriculum more aligned with their political worldview worried some experts and watchdogs.

“This sounds like a very slippery slope,” said Carole Basile, dean of Arizona State University’s Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. “It depends on what the curriculum actually looks like, but to move in the direction of letting partisan identity decide what is being taught, that feels new and worrying.”

Turning Point USA, founded by Kirk in 2012, rose to prominence by maintaining a “professor watchlist” promising to unmask liberal instructors. The nonprofit prospered under Trump’s presidency, raising more than $80 million from undisclosed donors, according to its four most recent tax filings. It announced its intentions to launch an academy last year, in the midst of an inflamed debate over how much schools should focus on racial inequity.

A bare-bones Web page says that public school students are taught a “false narrative about America” and that the academy will promote a “reliable, honest, and quality America-first education.” A 2021 Turning Point USA investor prospectus, which was obtained and published by the watchdog Center for Media and Democracy, highlights the project, which the prospectus says is necessary because “the Left has permeated America’s educational institutions.”

A promised debut last fall didn’t materialize. By that point, however, Kirk’s group had started discussions with StrongMind to help launch the academy, according to people who participated in the conversations and, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive details. StrongMind sells digital curriculum and educational technology, among other products.

In early discussions last fall, Turning Point USA learned from StrongMind executives that the company relied on labor in the Philippines, according to a person familiar with the conversations. The overseas workforce — tasked with creative efforts, such as graphic design, and confirmed by two additional people familiar with the setup — was notable because of Turning Point’s emphasis on an “America-first education.” Kolvet said that reliance on foreign labor posed a problem for Turning Point’s brand and that StrongMind was asked if the team working on the project could be domestic.

Still, the disclosure didn’t end preparations for a potential partnership.

StrongMind notified employees on Jan. 21 that work with Turning Point USA was underway and that Verano Learning Partners, an associated nonprofit led by the company’s founder and chief executive, Damian Creamer, was “pleased to add Turning Point Academy to its family of schools.”

“This private education option will offer K-12 families, nationwide, the choice to enroll in a fully online private school, bring together other families to form a learning pod, or school independently from home,” Cody Bendix, StrongMind’s corporate communications director, wrote on an internal messaging platform, according to screenshots reviewed by The Post.

The announcement caused an outcry inside the company, where some employees raised concerns in Zoom meetings about the move to partner with Kirk, according to four employees who attended the sessions.

Three employees said a StrongMind manager told staff that existing course content would mostly be suitable for the academy but that certain details would need to be adjusted or omitted. As an example, the company manager said Turning Point might have problems with a lesson plan using a speech by a Republican president to highlight propaganda techniques, according to people familiar with the comments.

In written responses to The Post, Bendix said StrongMind was anticipating that the curriculum for Turning Point Academy would be “nonpartisan.”

Appealing to disaffected parents was at the heart of StrongMind’s pitch. A business prospectus says working with Turning Point USA would have given the company “access to a network of 1,000 chapters across all 50 states made up of people frustrated with the state of public education.”

The plans were geared toward home schooling or a variation involving small groups of students — arrangements that grew more popular during the pandemic, with the number of households turning to home schooling doubling between April and October 2020, according to census data.

StrongMind’s leaders saw the partnership as a launchpad for national influence in the area of school choice, invoking the e-commerce giant Amazon as a model: “This initiative seeks to do the same for StrongMind and school choice.”

Kirk’s group completed the commercial equation. Turning Point USA, the document explains, “brings preexisting relationships with many target customers.” StrongMind, the document emphasizes, saw value in “opinion brand and reach.”

But a key subcontractor saw matters differently. The firm selected to help prepare curriculum was Freedom Learning Group, an education company run by military spouses and veterans. Its chief executive, Elizabeth O’Brien, told The Post in a text message last week, “When advised that the ultimate client was Turning Point USA, we notified the curriculum developer that we are terminating the contract.”

Creamer informed Turning Point USA of the setback the same day, effectively dissolving the partnership by making clear that StrongMind no longer had the capacity to help start the academy, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

Bendix, StrongMind’s corporate communications director, said the company needed its “reputable” subcontractor to proceed and, “since this is not an option, it is our understanding that discussions ended at that point.” Kirk’s spokesman said the reasons were “overall fit, capabilities, timelines and staffing.”

Creamer and other StrongMind executives were also intent on removing the company from the spotlight after learning that reporters were asking questions about its finances and operations, according to a person familiar with their thinking. Bendix said, “I have no knowledge and cannot offer comment on the personal opinions of executives.” He declined to make Creamer available for an interview.

Within Arizona, StrongMind is no stranger to scrutiny. A series of stories in the Arizona Republic described how a charter school founded by Creamer and owned by StrongMind, Primavera Online, receives state tax dollars and then directs millions to StrongMind for software and curriculum services.

The arrangement is legal because Primavera has received an exemption from procurement regulations that apply to traditional public schools, leading government watchdogs and some public officials to call for stricter regulation. A recent audit suggested that Creamer, as StrongMind’s lone shareholder, collected at least $3.5 million from the firm last year.

In response to questions about the arrangement, Bendix said the charter school “is in compliance with applicable federal and state laws related to the use of public funds and accounting for the use of these funds.” In a 2018 opinion column responding to the Arizona Republic’s findings, Creamer stressed his school’s “immense value … to the people of Arizona.”

Detroit, Orlando and San Antonio already have the space, and teams such as Memphis or the Rockets (who could waive and stretch John Wall) could get there fairly easily. Portland also has a plausible path to room for Simmons now, too, having traded Norm Powell and Robert Covington to the Clippers and C.J. McCollum to New Orleans. As we reported back in December, Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard is known to have interest in playing with Simmons.

Step 2: Find a new home for Tobias Harris’ contract via trade, which would be challenging but likely not impossible. He’s owed a combined $79.4 million over the next two seasons. The Sixers could theoretically waive and stretch Harris as well (per our cap expert, Danny Leroux, that move would open up approximately $22.3 million in space).

Step 3: Sign Harden for either the max (starting salary of $42 million) or something close to it. And for anyone who’s hung up on the fact that the Sixers might struggle to get to Harden’s max number, consider this much: At this later stage of Harden’s career, he has made it abundantly clear that his focus is on the goal of winning a title. The belief in Philadelphia, sources say, is that he wouldn’t let $10 million or $20 million (over the life of a deal) be a deal-breaker if he wanted to play for the Sixers.

So, why am I laying all of this out now? Because of the pressure that comes with the deadline of course.

&gt;People can have different internet latency (5-200 milliseconds)

For something like the Stroop, where the main effect of interest is the *difference* between reaction times in two conditions, latency per se doesn't matter as much as variance. If someone has a constant lag of e.g. 20ms in their stimulus presentation, it doesn't really matter if it effects both conditions equally because it will just be cancelled out. Generally speaking, most of the available packages do pretty well on this regard. See the Timing megastudy paper already posted by InfuriatinglyOpaque.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Different keyboard/processing system means that the key input will have differences (I don't know by how much but I'm thinking 2-10 milliseconds).

There were papers that looked at this before browser based experiments took off (see e.g. Damian, 2010). There are differences in the polling rates of different devices/operating systems, so that e.g. some keyboards only check for changes in input every 18ms (so if you're reaction times are perfectly synced to the stimulus, then all your reaction times would be in multiples of 18). Generally speaking, there is so much variability in human reaction time anyway that it probably won't have a massive impact with a decent number of trials if you're looking at mean reaction time differences.

Basically, I wouldn't be too worried using one of the established packages for a Stroop. I would be more conscious of a study looking at individual differences in overall reaction times (i.e. not subtracting between conditions to derive an experimental effect), because then your differences in setups won't be cancelled out. You could always record browser and OS information as part of your study and include it as a covariate in your analyses if you have a large enough sample.

[],False,,TRIPITIS,1507045980.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fz1o794,False,False,"Throughout an exhausting, all-consuming preparation for the 2020 NBA Draft, [Timberwolves](https://theathletic.com/team/timberwolves/) officials tried to examine every single aspect of the top three prospects available to them with the top pick.

A key part of their decision-making process centered around a simple truth. Whoever was coming to Minnesota had to want it. For all of the progress they believed they were making with the roster, the Wolves knew they still had so far to go. They needed a star at No. 1, someone who wasn’t afraid of the Herculean task that was ahead of him to help lift a franchise that has been buried under ice and snow for most of the last two decades. They needed someone who wasn’t going to run from the fight, who wasn’t going to complain about the cold weather or the old arena or the lack of tradition. It was always going to take an almost irrational level of audacity to turn one of the NBA’s least successful franchises into a winner.

[James Wiseman](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/warriors/james-wiseman/), sources told The Athletic, did not want to come to Minnesota and play behind Karl-Anthony Towns. [LaMelo Ball](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/hornets/lamelo-ball/) was curiously quiet and short with his conversations with personnel in the interview process, leaving the impression that he wasn’t excited about being with the Timberwolves. Then there was [Anthony Edwards](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/timberwolves/anthony-edwards/), who made it abundantly clear to them that he was ready for anything they could throw at him.

As Edwards rained hellfire on the [Portland Trail Blazers](https://theathletic.com/team/blazers/) on Tuesday night, dragging a dead-in-the-water Timberwolves team by the scruff of their necks to a victory they had no business pulling out, he did it with a belief in himself and his teammates that is so outlandish that not even the cynicism baked into 17 years of dysfunction and embarrassment can bring it down.

When it was all over in Portland, Edwards put up 40 points on 27 shots, nine rebounds, three blocks and three steals, the fourth time in his young career he has scored at least 40 points. Only [LeBron James](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/lakers/lebron-james/) (eight) has more 40-point games before his 21st birthday. It may have been Edwards’ best game yet, both for the two-way brilliance and for the fact that for much of the game, his teammates just didn’t have their A-games. Portland’s funky defense limited Towns to just seven shots, [D’Angelo Russell](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/timberwolves/dangelo-russell/)’s handle wasn’t as tight as it has been and the Wolves were clanking jumpers and layups to fall behind by 13 points early in the third quarter.

It was a game the Wolves could not afford to lose with a brutal four-game stretch of Western Conference contenders looming, and Edwards wouldn’t let them. He scored 14 points in the fourth quarter, including a jaw-dropping four-point play over rising youngster [Anfernee Simons](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/blazers/anfernee-simons/) that gave the Wolves a 91-90 lead with under eight minutes to play. He made 5 of 13 3-pointers in the game, 9 of 14 from inside the arc and shook off an aching knee from a collision late in Sunday’s win over Brooklyn and a calf cramp after a dunk in the fourth quarter on Tuesday night to will the Wolves to the win.

“I feel like Black Jesus,” Edwards said after shrugging his shoulders. “Yeah.”

Sitting right next to Edwards in the postgame news conference, Russell couldn’t help but smile as he listened to Edwards describe what it felt like to put the team on his shoulders and deliver the way he did in Portland.

“I’m gonna sit back for this one,” Russell said.

But he didn’t argue. That is what Edwards has brought to the table in his short time in Minnesota, a personality as bright as the aurora green jerseys the Timberwolves wear on Saturdays, a belief in himself purer than the waters of Lake Minnetonka and stubborn refusal to succumb to the same old excuses that so many players, coaches and executives have used over the last 15-plus seasons as to why you supposedly can’t win in Minnesota.

Edwards is too young to care about how things fell apart late in [Kevin Garnett](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/timberwolves/kevin-garnett/)’s first tour with the Wolves. He has too much swag to buy into the belief that players get held back in a market like the Twin Cities. He doesn’t give a damn that [Kevin Love](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/cavaliers/kevin-love/), [Ricky Rubio](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/cavaliers/ricky-rubio/), [Andrew Wiggins](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/warriors/andrew-wiggins/), Jimmy Butler, Tom Thibodeau and so many others have come through this franchise and failed to turn it around.

Edwards lost his mother and grandmother to cancer when he was 14 years old, [drove more than an hour each way through Atlanta gridlock](https://theathletic.com/2898032/2021/10/19/the-subtle-strength-of-anthony-edwards/) every day to attend high school and eschewed more traditional college basketball powers to play at Georgia. Do you think a little thing like going to work at a place with more than 1,500 losses and only one trip past the first round of the playoffs is going to scare him?

He named his pit bull Ant Jr. Does that sound like someone with a shortage of confidence?

“He’s got such a great spirit about him,” coach Chris Finch said. “He’s pretty much indomitable in that way. His teammates love him, and they love him for not only how he plays but who he is as a player because he’s genuine.”

It would be hard to find a franchise that needed it more, a player with a northern lights smile who won’t take no for an answer. Since Garnett departed in 2007, many have tried to assume that mantle. Love put up the numbers but couldn’t deliver the wins. Rubio brought the charisma and the enthusiasm, but injuries and limitations as a shooter prevented him from breaking through. Wiggins had the physical tools but not the desire to be great. Butler had the toughness and the skill but tapped out after one year. Towns has come the closest, putting up huge numbers and professing his love for the city and the team, but the instability around him has prevented him from delivering on the promise he made to Flip Saunders to turn this team into a consistent winner.

In Edwards, Towns has finally found a teammate he can connect with, one who combines the impossible-to-hate youthful exuberance with a lion’s taste for the jugular and a showman’s sense for the moment. It was all on display against the Trail Blazers, who may have been missing franchise player [Damian Lillard](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/blazers/damian-lillard/) but had won six of their previous eight games.

The Wolves came out flat, shooting 32 percent from 3 in the first half and allowing the Blazers to hang 63 points on them. Edwards was the only one who had it going, scoring 19 points in the first half. With Towns neutralized and Russell not as sharp as he has been, Edwards had to attack.

The Wolves were down 13 early in the third quarter. They closed the quarter on a 20-7 run, and Edwards made his move in the final three minutes. His 3-pointer tied the score at 82 and then he snaked to the rim for a layup in traffic to give Minnesota an 84-82 lead as the quarter came to a close.

Towns shook Edwards’ hands as the two went back to the bench, and as he sat down, a smile creased his face. He knew at that moment the Blazers messed up. They didn’t put the Wolves away when they could have. The open 3s they hit in the first half started to miss. The slick passes for layups started to glance off their fingertips and fall out of bounds. The offensive rebounds and hustle plays were eliminated. And now Edwards had them on their heels.

“I saw the man in front of me and I saw fear in his eyes, I guess,” Edwards said. “That was all she wrote.”

The four-point play came at 7:50 of the fourth quarter, giving the Wolves a 91-90 lead. Russell had a turnover just 40 seconds later, but Edwards clapped his way back up the court, encouraging his teammates to lock in, knowing the game was there to be had. [Jarred Vanderbilt](https://theathletic.com/player/nba/timberwolves/jarred-vanderbilt/) grabbed a rebound and Edwards immediately went to him to get the ball, burying a 3 on the other end. Midway through the quarter, he knifed through a double, plowed past CJ McCollum at the rim and converted an and-1 for a 97-94 lead.

As Edwards started rolling, the belief in his teammates swelled as well.

“I want him to get 50. Once he gets 50, I want him to get 60,” said Russell, who finished with 22 points and was credited with the go-ahead bucket with two seconds remaining after Simons was called for goaltending. “We were just joking about it. If we would’ve went into overtime, he probably would’ve reached it. I’m glad we didn’t have to. We got up out of there. He’s more than capable.”

Edwards did it all dealing with a balky knee that was so painful after a collision late in the win over Brooklyn on Sunday that he could barely walk off the court. But when the injury report came out for the game in Portland, Edwards wasn’t even listed as questionable, giving this tortured fan base another reason to hope their franchise’s star-crossed days could be moving into the rearview.

Edwards put another scare into the Wolves faithful when he came up limping after a dunk with four minutes to go. But he went to the bench for only a matter of moments before returning from what he called a calf cramp, and he played the rest of the game. Each time he went to the bench for a stoppage down the stretch, Wolves athletic trainer Erin Sierer would immediately throw an ice bag on his leg and use a massager to try to keep his calf loose, like a cut man working on a boxer in the corner between rounds.

We need to talk about conversion therapy before it is barred, say MPs Some 30 Tory MPs have warned against rushing through a new law 'without debate'

By Edward Malnick, SUNDAY POLITICAL EDITOR 22 January 2022 • 8:00pm Boris Johnson is facing mounting calls to halt the fast-tracking of a ban on conversion therapy, as 30 Tory MPs warn against rushing through a new law ""without debate"".

In a letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which has been seen by this newspaper, the MPs say they are ""deeply concerned"" that the proposed ban could also ""criminalise legitimate therapies"" for children suffering from gender dysphoria - the unease or distress experienced by those who feel at odds with their sex.

The Government's plans to outlaw gay conversion therapy - which are not seen as controversial - were first promised by the Conservatives in 2018.

But proposals published last year make clear that the ban would also encapsulate conversion therapy aimed at changing gender identity, which MPs fear will criminalise routine conversations between children and parents, teachers, or clinicians.

The timing of the letter suggests that overhauling plans to introduce a ban ""as quickly as possible"" is a key demand of a significant number of MPs as Mr Johnson prepares to announce a series of major policy and staffing changes in a bid to save his premiership.

Consultation period extended In December, Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary and equalities minister, bowed to pressure to extend the formal consultation on the issue, which was initially restricted to just six weeks and due to close before Christmas. It is now open until February 4 after Mr Johnson raised concerns with aides about the initial time period.

In the letter to the Prime Minister, MPs understood to include Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, Jackie Doyle-Price, the ex health minister, and a string of members of the Conservatives' 2019 intake, state: ""We are deeply concerned that the Government’s recent proposals could criminalise legitimate therapies for children who are suffering from gender dysphoria.

""What is being proposed could have significant unintended consequences for children and could lead to parents, therapists and teachers - who are trying to help children explore why they say they are transgender - facing prosecution.""

The MPs, who are also understood to include Sir Robert Syms, a former whip, and Ben Bradley, an ex vice chairman of the Conservatives, add: ""This is a very complex and sensitive issue – indeed it is the focus for the NHS’ Cass Review, due to report in early summer – and we welcome the Government’s commitment that the consultation “marks the start of [its] formal public engagement]”.

MPs keen not to rush the legislation ""We do not see how this is compatible with an intention to “deliver a ban as quickly as possible”, with a “draft bill for spring 2022”. We should be listening and learning from each other as we legislate in this sensitive area, not rushing things onto the statute books without debate.

""Much can be gained if we have more debate and scrutiny, but there are severe risks and consequences for children, parents, teachers and therapists if we give in to calls to rush legislation and truncate consideration of these issues.""

The plan to explicitly outlaw ""abhorrent"" gay conversion therapies was first announced by Theresa May in 2018. It is being championed by Henry Newman, one of Mr Johnson's senior advisers.

The plans are being fast-tracked in order to present a bill to the Commons in time for an LGBT conference being hosted by Britain next summer. Lord Goldsmith, the environment minister, has publicly warned that it was “so important that we get this legislation right”.

Last month, Ms Truss insisted that parents and teachers will remain free to talk to children about “whether they are transgender or not”. But, in a letter to MPs and peers, the Cabinet minister said the Government remained “committed to preparing legislation to ban conversion therapy for Spring 2022 and introducing this as soon as Parliamentary time allows.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1642941490.0,,False,0.0,{},htvglnv,True,t3_sass2f,True,t1_htvglnv,True,t3_sass2f,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/sass2f/we_need_to_talk_about_conversion_therapy_before/htvglnv/,1645334517.0,-2.0,False,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We do not see how this is compatible with an intention to “deliver a ban as quickly as possible”, with a “draft bill for spring 2022”. We should be listening and learning from each other as we legislate in this sensitive area, not rushing things onto the statute books without debate.

""Much can be gained if we have more debate and scrutiny, but there are severe risks and consequences for children, parents, teachers and therapists if we give in to calls to rush legislation and truncate consideration of these issues.""

The plan to explicitly outlaw ""abhorrent"" gay conversion therapies was first announced by Theresa May in 2018. It is being championed by Henry Newman, one of Mr Johnson's senior advisers.

The plans are being fast-tracked in order to present a bill to the Commons in time for an LGBT conference being hosted by Britain next summer. Lord Goldsmith, the environment minister, has publicly warned that it was “so important that we get this legislation right”.

Last month, Ms Truss insisted that parents and teachers will remain free to talk to children about “whether they are transgender or not”. But, in a letter to MPs and peers, the Cabinet minister said the Government remained “committed to preparing legislation to ban conversion therapy for Spring 2022 and introducing this as soon as Parliamentary time allows.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1642934916.0,,False,0.0,{},htv7rzu,True,t3_sar1wl,False,t1_htv7rzu,False,t3_sar1wl,/r/LabourUK/comments/sar1wl/we_need_to_talk_about_conversion_therapy_before/htv7rzu/,1645335033.0,16.0,False,True,False,LabourUK,t5_30c1v,r/LabourUK,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, otherwise, he’ll find hits with the skill set we’re looking for lower in the draft or obtain them undrafted or through free agency.

I still believe this case has one very good strenght of doing misdirection very well (once again, I refer to a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/jokd9i/the_monstrous_turnabout_is_fun_52_spoilers/) made by a person more eloquent than me, recommend reading this beforehand), but I admit the execution could be a lot better. Is it the lenght? Is it the weird complexity of villian's plan? Perhaps both or something else. With that in mind, let's give fixing it a go.

* **Cut some unnecessary fluff, and polish up the dialogue remaining.** Things like Damian's possession and Jinxie's sleepwalking ultimately do not add enough to the plot to be significant. In fact, there might be enough content to remove that **the case could be turned into a 1 investigation - 1 trial long case.** Extend the investigation longer, and cut it ""softly"" in half with Damian giving you the key to the chamber for better pacing (no need to swallow it, ew, just have it hidden on his person). This allows for the case to keep its strong points - Apollo and Athena banter, Blackquill and Fullbright introductions, mystery - while removing a lot of tediousness.
* More of a problem with DD as a whole, but **add examining every scene back.** More fluff text for world building and character interactions is always good.
* **Contrary to popular opinions, keep showing L'Belle commiting the crime in the intro.** It is an essential part to the misdirection.
* **Give Trucy better screentime, and, if not more, then higher quality.** For example, if one keeps the case lenght to two days after all, let her tag along when investigating the air ducts, using her experience with escape tricks and her wit to look for alternative escape routes (she doesn't find any, but she does find the fact that the foxes rotate). If it's shortened to one day, just give her dialogue more charm and wit. Mention that ever since receiving the rights to Gramarye tricks, she has been hard at work on reviving the Troupe magic, and hasn't had much time to spend with Polly lately, but they are both glad to have reason to just relax for a day together. Have her defend Polly from Jinxie's demon accusations more. Add more silly banter. And finally, give her a *good* reason to not be around so much in the case itself. Since she also has the Gramarye power, she has noticed that Jinxie has been much more anxious and nervous ever since accepting this job, and it has affected her performance, mood and grades. Trucy's worried that with the arrest of her father, she might completely break down out of stress, so she would prefer to stay with her dear friend and support her.
* Finally, the villian. I'll admit that most of DD's villians are quite weak, but I have found out that they actually share a very interesting theme - the main game's three big villians each correspond to one of the trait complexes of [the Dark Triad.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad) L'Belle's should be quite obvious - narcissism. **I truly believe one could improve each one of the villians if they were to emphasize this idea even more.** For example, to improve the motive, make L'Belle actually sell his product ... but only if he has developed a more refined version of said product, which he keeps for himself. That way, he always ensures that he has the edge over anyone else and feels superior to them. It could also explain why he needs both the gold ingot and the blackmail money - cosmetics' R&amp;D can be very expensive. In addition, he could also be after his boss' position as the alderman, which would further feed his ego of being better and stronger than anyone in Nine Tails's Vale. All these details about L'Belle and more could be improved if one explains them as feeding his pathologic need for validation.
* A minor thing, but **remove some of the coincidences piling up.** There are quite a few of them. For example, make Filch mention that he overheard L'Belle saying that ""Alderman will be busy now. For a long, long time..."" and interpreted it as the chance to do his treasure stealing plan.

I just want to be clear that I am not asking for a full refund for a single set since I did not pay the full price but, I asked them to fix this by exchanging the product or sending me the missing key but since they don't want to I asked for a refund (even if it's only half of the price) since it's my only option at this point.

I should have mention this before but I didn't think it was all that relevant.

I got this keycap set for Black Friday, It was 2 sets for 1 on the MT3 keycap sets. After writing back to them asking to return the product for a refund they responded that they can't make a refund since I got this set for ""free"" The only reason I asked for a refund is because they don't want to replace it, which in my opinion would be the right thing to do.

This is exactly what they replied:

Hello again,I understand the concern, and would be happy to help clear things up. After further review, I can see that no money was captured on our end for the Dasher set.Since you got these for free, there is no way for us to issue a full refund for them.

[],False,,FactCheckerJack,1589776449.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3z4nacvs,False,False,"Well, it's basically impossible unless you're a social media wizard.  So let's see...  
\-You can spam promote your content on other websites like Reddit, genius, twitter, etc.  This won't help much, as these type of posts usually have 0-1 upvotes.  
\-You can pay for youtube ads.  $50 will get you about 600 views.  But a lot of those views, people will only watch the ad for 5 seconds before skipping.  
\-You can post on Facebook about your beats and basically promote them to your friends.  Only problem is, friends aren't going to be as interested in listening to beats as they are completed songs.  
\-As a general principle, you want people who are your fans.  Fans are the type of people who watch the same video over and over.  Friends can sometimes be fans.  But like, for example, friends may not listen to rap songs repeatedly if they aren't into rap.  The best hope of getting fans, aside from your friends, is from the nichest niche communities, i.e. targeting people who are fans of someone who you sound exactly like.  
\-You can try to get followers on social media and then promote your beats afterwards.  E.g. try to follow-follow back 1,000 people on Twitter, and then start tweeting out your beats.  
\-You can basically bait engagement by your video titles and the type of content you make.  For example, if you make an original song with an original title, no one is ever going to search for it on youtube.  But people might inadvertently search for it if your video title matches-up with something they're searching for, like ""All Mike Tyson Knockouts"".  Or if, for example, you posted covers of famous songs, people might find the videos by virtue of searching for the famous song.  
\-You can post non-beats content.  For example, are you familiar with [reaction videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leXEq6VyV-o)?  You can post like 50 reaction videos and then start uploading your beats after you get some subscribers.  
\-Collaborating helps.  For example, your beat, four local rappers on the track, and a video with dozens of local Instagram influencers.  Maybe each of you individually only has 100-300 friends / followers.  But if all of you promote the video on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter; then you can mutually get each other noticed.  On Instagram, there's also various pages for jewelry, clothing, salons, photographers, etc.; and a lot of these pages are also interested in collaborating.  
\-Be more noticed.  I.e. post 50 tweets / tweet replies a day.  Comment on dozens of Instagram posts each day.  Comment on a bunch of youtube videos.  There are some people like [Justin Y.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3IZ8x2KRk) who comment on youtube videos so prolifically that they've gained over 100,000 subscribers just from commenting.  Like, I mean, go to [Youtube Trending](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) and comment on all of the popular videos.

I think it makes more sense to have him be with Barbara in his personal run since she's involved in way more stories centered around him, and the bulk of Starfire/Nightwing stories are in that New Titans run that predates his solo series by several years. Something that I don't think r/Nightwing realizes but is 1000% true is that Starfire never appeared in an issue of Nightwing's solo series until she had a brief cameo in Rebirth... And the point of said cameo was that Damian had told all of Dick's exes he got a new girlfriend lol.

Roy does twice as well, though I think technically he was part of the Outlaws for one of them. Donna appears too but it's technically a hallucination, and I think Garth makes one appearance.

Edit: Downvote brigaid has already gotten to me but I'll continue on a little tangent. A good portion of r/Nightwing just really doesn't want Dick or his life situation to change... like *at all*. And honestly, I can't blame them when you put it in the context of Nightwing the last couple of years. When DC editorial has *tried* changing aspects of his character its usually resulted in things like the Ric Grayson saga. *Unfortunately* him not changing means that they don't want him to have any character development as well.

[],False,,FlyByTieDye,1353318678.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ncc7,False,False,"Hey there, thanks for the response, even if my post did leave you confused. I'll try and answer you as best as I can.

&gt;  It sounds like you wanted to analyze the comic under a particular light even though the story doesn't suggest it should be analyzed by the parameters you set.

Yes, in analyais, you can impose a reading, or analytical framework on top, but I do think this is the themes of the text, and not my projections, for reasons I'll describe below.

&gt; I think the problem is that you're trying to reach the authors' minds, going by their other work, but not paying attention that writers don't have to keep a theme or a set of ideas over their body of work.

I certainly agree that authors don't need to have the same themes across works, though often they do. For example, Tomasi has been writing about Fatherhood since GLC, the first instance of that trope I can identify being with Mongul II as a kid and Mongul I. Though I'm not trying to impose Batman and Robin's themes on their Superman run, it was a conclusion I came to only after reading the run, not something I chose to do before starting. 

&gt; Above all, I'm really confused what makes you think that portraying dysfunctional families leads to it being a theme that should be applied to the Kents and that leads to some inherent ""oddness"" since the Kents themselves aren't dysfunctional.

Basically in writing and art, a motiff is a repeated pattern within the text, that when sharing an underlying idea or commentary, becomes a theme. So there is a repeat pattern of dysfunctional families in the text, from the Frankensteins, to the Waynes, to the New 52 Lois and Clark, to the alien mercenaries, to Kalibek and Darkseid, and to the Bizarros. That is its motiff. Usually in writing, the antagonists or foils make something of a parallel to the protagonists, mirroring them in their theme. 

For example, in Batman and Robin, Morgan Ducard becoming an assassin to follow in the footsteps of his father Henri Ducard mirrors Damian's want for approval from Bruce by following in his footsteps, the difference is that Bruce won't approve of killing, so Damian then changing his direction and following in Ducard's footsteps won't get him any closer to his ultimate want of Bruce's approval. The parallel comes in all but a handful of differences between protagonist and foil, usually in regards to choices the protagonosts are able to make, e.g. do I act more like my father, or more like Morgan? 

Relating back to Superman, they've established dysfunctional families as a theme, so if the Kent's were dysfunctional in ways mirroring their foils, except for those one or two key features, it would make for a good thematic divide. I agree to your regard that the Kent's just aren't a dysfunctional family. I'm not trying to suggest I want to see them be dysfunctional, just that if all of their antagonists and foils revolve around this motiff of dysfunctional families (which they do) then it makes for a poor thematic fit for the Superman and family book to deal with. I hope that makes sense. So using your analogy, the text makes a round hole in the form of the villains/foils families, thats a part of the text, but the square peg of the Kent family just don't fit into this theme, making it a poorer choice of theme.
 
&gt; The most glaring might be ""as Jon makes a statement akin to 'this family's not perfect, but it's mine'"". I was so astonished that I could've missed something like that that I had to go pick up the issue and read it again. I don't think I was able to find anything similar to that, the closest I can think of is Clark's ""...  remember, son, follow truth, seek justice and stand with your family who loves you. Even when they're not perfect."" 

That must have been a misquote by me, apologies, and thanks for providing me the actual quote. Though you suggest the context is different, of Clark promising to help Jon to be better, he still does use the terms ""Even when they're not perfect"", which invites us to ask why does Clark think his family is not pertect, based on what we've seen? That quote motivated me to reflect on the text, in fact, and assess how it portrays families, and as you can hopefully see, the antagonists and foils all do share this idea of dysfunctional families, but I don't believe it reflects well in the Kent's after all we've seen, making it an odd remark and conclusion from Clark.

&gt; In context, Jon is talking about his mistakes, and then Clark says that he promised he'd help Jon go through his problems, and that he did, and for that Jon came out as a better person. And that's the theme.

Well, a text can actually have multiple themes. I had even put forward multiple themes in my post, a major theme of dysfunctional families, that I see as not working for this text, and a minor theme of Superman saving people from their darkness, which while I feel is more on brand for Superman, has less of a presence in the text. So, that you have identified a theme of Superman helping Jon through his struggles doesn't exclude my themes of also being a part of the text, which it is, and if anything compliments the second theme I put forward. Because across 45 or so issues, a creative team can of course come up with a lot of ideas, translating into multiple themes.

&gt; It's not about being dysfunctional, but how things happen, people make mistakes, sometimes you're put in unfavorable situations, but if you have a family that loves you, one that you can fallback, you can face any adversities. 

I guess love as a value is a way of identifying the difference between the Kent's and their foils. The Erradicator, in being a robot, cannot understand the value that love brings to the Kent family, instead only looking at the family through a purely biological framework. The Frankenfam are completely out of love. Bruce has love (coated in a lot of discipline) for Damian, though no love for Talia (not that we see her in this run). New 52 Clark and Lois share no love, but it's Jon's love that brings his version of his parents back. The alien mercenary family share love, that keeps them together, but have no love for Manchester Black, though kept in his employ. Kalibek's want for Darkseid back I don't think represents love, more so ambition for the throne. And the Bizarro's certainly have no love. So that is a good way to explain the deviation betwren the Kents and their opposites. 

To me though, it still falls a bit short becase the Kent's are never challenged in their love, it's always at a constant. There's never like an argument, where one of them has to question their love for each other, or confusion of their love for utility, or confusing discipline for a lack of love, or anything that has them reflect on whether they might become like their villains one day. They are a family bound by love at the highest level, besieged by loveless foes, but the foes never make a dent in their love, or deviate the decisions or actions our heroes take. Though as I said earlier, in a way, that's what makes the New 52 Clark and Lois the most workable of this theme, just not due to their decisions, but decisions of editorial. It was the only time when the love they share was anything less than 100%. 

&gt; When the comic presents a dysfunctional family, it's not about dysfunction itself. It's a foil to the Kents, showing why they manage success why others fail. The point is not that the Kents are dysfunctional, it's that they aren't and that allows them to face the adversities they face.

I can agree that the Kent's aren't dysfunctional, but that's why I think making their enemies out of dysfunctional families is a poor fit. Another way of looking at it is tension. If we're always matching up dysfunctional families against the one functional, perfect family, who do you think is going to win? If again and again, these foes are pitted against the Kents, and the Kents love or function as a family never deviates, then what is the challenge? Where is the tension? It is an odd choice of challenge for the Kents, as it never tests them in any ways that challenges how they operate as a family.

But as I also said in my post, that doesn't make it a bad rum, or bad writing. It has a lot to say, just coming short on execution. But its still a solid B/B+ that's worth attention and at least 1 read through.

Last Pick: Heat ML (-140) @ Kings, loss

Heartbreaking loss for the Heat in this game vs the Kings as it came down to the wire and Jimmy Butler ended up missing the game tying layup as time expired to send it to overtime. Onto the next one but this was a bad loss for the Heat. The Heat struggled to hit their shots early in the game which turned out to hurt them in the end. Onto the next one. 

 Pick of the day: Atlanta Hawks -4 (-110) @ Portland Trailblazers

Reasoning: In this matchup, I really like the spread here for multiple reasons. First off, the Trailblazers will be missing both Damian Lillard (injury) as well as Jusuf Nurkic (COIVD) who are two key pieces to their offense (Lillard basically being their entire offense). Defensively speaking, while the Hawks do rank 25th, the Trailblazers rank dead last in the NBA and without Nurkic I could very well see the Hawks putting up numbers against them. The Hawks rank 2nd in the NBA in points per 100 possessions only behind the Jazz and the Trailblazers rank 16th but, again, without Lillard and Nurkic I could see their offense stalling. Not only this, but the Hawks have been playing with a decimated roster due to COVID and as of today they are getting back a majority of their roster with players like Kevin Huerter, Sharife Cooper, Onyeka Okongwu, Danilo Gallinari, and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot. Trae Young has been playing outstanding without these players, putting up 35 against a good Cavaliers defense in their last game and I think that with these added pieces back to their roster it can make scoring much easier for everyone all around. Overall I see the Hawks being easily able to cover the spread in this matchup.

The New 52 *was* a relaunch, but is mainly referred to as a reboot, which means that the continuity was altered to a drastic extent, and in some cases, reset. DC Rebirth was strictly a relaunch, with a new comic lineup but no drastic continuity alteration aside from some mild incorporation of Post-Crisis/Pre-Flashpoint elements here and there.

A retcon (short for retroactive continuity) is a way of retroactively altering the events of a story  or event after that event has occurred. For example, the 2005 Nightwing: Year One storyline retcons the events of 1987's Batman #408 by offering a new Nightwing origin story that contradicts the one presented in Batman #408. Generally, reboots work by retconning large swaths of continuity and replacing it with new stuff. This is mostly how the New 52 operated. 

As for what is and isn't canon in the New 52 and Rebirth, it's pretty hard to tell. Batman was one of the few characters in the New 52 whose history wasn't completely reset, but we were left with an established Batman with a condensed timeline maybe 5-8 years long and no direct indication of what was and wasn't canon. We do know that Dick did have a stint as Batman, and we can assume that those events took place similarly to how they did Pre-Flashpoint. However, Tim's new New 52 origin meant that most of his history was pretty much gone, or at least drastically changed in an undefined way. Jason being a redhead was retconned (again) but I'm not sure if he ever went to Arkham. 

TL;DR Since Grant Morrison's Batman run continued into the New 52, you can assume that the general story events of Bruce dying and Dick becoming Batman with Damian as Robin are still canon, but the specifics may not be the same with regards to certain characters.

Other famous stories may have happened to a degree but were drastically altered. For example, Bane was mentioned to have broken Batman's back years ago in the New 52, but unlike Batman: Knightfall, Azrael did not exist in New 52 continuity until soon before DC Rebirth occured, despite playing a massive role in the original Knightfall story. Other key characters in Batman comics such as Oracle, Huntress, Spoiler, and Cassandra Cain did not exist for the majority of the New 52, and when they did show up they were different from their Pre-Flashpoint selves. 

I kind of just like to headcanon a lot of New 52 stuff as a continuation of Post-Crisis and do my best to fit it into Post-Crisis is and ignore the inconsistencies. But lots of other times I just tend to ignore the New 52 onwards. 

Moving on from that though, the recent Infinite Frontier event recently apparently restored all past continuity, with all characters now remembering their pasts from Pre-Flashpoint continuity. This sounds great on paper and from now on you can envision everything as canon again, but to me all it really does is just create more contradictions. 

TL;DR again; If something from the past is explicitly referenced, it's canon. If not, and you're in the New 52, it probably isn't. If you're in Rebirth, it's muddy.

In my experience, promoting music is radically harder than making good music.  The best way to build-up youtube views / subscribers might be... and I dunno for sure, but I think might be to post like hundreds of videos where you're doing covers, freestyles, recording your own verses over song instrumentals, posting personal lifestyle updates, and stuff like that.  Even if the videos get taken down, who cares as long as you end-up with subscribers?  And then, after you have subscribers, then start posting your original songs.  It's important to get subscribers by any means, whether or not you're able to legally monetize your tracks.  Once you get subscribers, you can focus on making legit, legal, licensable music.

What batman needs is a series that continues. Get into the robins, honestly start with grayson and time jump in the second movie to the teenage phase with them breaking up at the end and being replaced by jason weeks later.

Movie three can have the titans, nightwing and jasons death at the end. 

Movie four could be damien showing up and red hood.  (Tim can be skipped, he doesnt bring much that dick didnt cover thematically). 

Then we get batmans death and the o.g robin dick grayson becoming the new batman with damien at his side. 

Next movie is bruce wayne traveling through time as batman  different eras (because darkside didnt kill him but through him into the past) 

Nexy film Bruce returns, struggles with damians killing people. They have fights but come to accept and love each other by the end just before damian is murdered by his clones at the end.

Nightwing dies in a justice league film (but really is alive thanks to lex luthor and bruces hides the fact he is alive from the batfamily)

Really batman is the one comic that never gets rebooted. It is actually the key to introducing. Everything else. It leads into teen titans which involves super boy which involves lex luthor and superman. You wondergirl. Flashes kid sidekick. Ect.

Thats how they could have built up the world. Stand alone heros. Teen titans movie about dick and batman falling out which would introduce tons of justice league members. Then justice league movies that advance both teen titans and batman plots (batman died in a justice league comic, same with nightwing)

This year, OKC is 8.4 points better when SGA is on the floor vs when he sits. Insane. Last year it was 4.4 points better. No talent you say? Ok: in 2020 when OKC was a playoff team, OKC was 3.4 points better when he was on the floor vs off. 

Man I love Maxey but you make out anyone who doesn’t value Maxey as the second coming of Gary Payton as an idiot. The Sixers haven’t even been better when Maxey is on the floor, he has a negative net rating overall. 

SGA has PROBING ability which is what allows him to actually play point guard. Yes, Maxey racks up assists but he’s not a primary creator, most of his assists come off secondary actions. Maxey only has 1 gear. When he gets the ball, he only goes to the rim at full speed. His only reads for passing are the center for a lob and the strong side corner. He never pauses his dribble mid drive to survey the floor and see who is open on the weak side (or even at the top of the key when Joel is wide open). SGA is a very methodical ball handler. He can get into the lane without feeling rushed. He’s a threat to pop up for a mid range, can see the whole floor being 6’6, and also a threat to draw fouls. Even when he was 21 he drew fouls at a much higher rate than Maxey. He can bully smaller guards pretty easily in the paint. 

Defensively hes 6’6 and has a 6’11 wingspan. Maxey will never be able to have the same defensive versatility that SGA has. Dude is basically the size of a 3 playing point guard (something you really desire). 

Again I’m not a jackass Maxey hater. He’s going to pretty good. But he’s still extremely raw. Maxey isn’t going to be Damian Lillard or Gary Payton as you seem so convinced of.

In the books Alex requests multiple times for lethal weaponry, whether it be guns or explosives and is denied under the orders of Blunt. A few times Smithers gives him stuff that could definitely be used in lethal ways, and he does this against orders. For example, in the novel version of Eagle Strike, Alex is given a bike that has heat-seeking missiles, which he uses to blow up a car or motorcycle or something when trying to escape from Damian Cray's guards.

My point was that generally Alex doesn't have an issue with using a gun, the reason he doesn't is because he doesn't get one. In the TV show it would have been so easy for Alex to pick up a gun but they gave no reason as to why he didn't pick it up. He could have used that against Cray, Programmer Lady, and the Guard instead of just rushing the room. Not to mention, even while Alex does have issues with killing someone in cold blood, he kills or severely injures a bunch of people throughout the books.

In Stormbreaker, Alex strategically detonates a smoke bomb causing Mr Grin to be blinded and he crashes a plane and dies. In the same book Alex kills that guy on the quad-bike or gets him killed I forget the exact details of that. In Point Blanc, Alex crashes that snowmobile into Griefs helicopter, killing him. That was completely intentional, he definitely knew what he was doing. In Skeleton Key Alex uses that magnet thing to kill Conrad by basically fucking destroying his back and body with the magnet. That's not even including all the side characters that Alex takes down or kills/severely maims in the process of trying to escape or get somewhere. There are a lot more examples of this too that take place after Eagle Strike but I won't get into that.

Not to mention in the TV show Alex caused that guy to fall down the stairs and break his neck, just before that scene. It would be pretty stupid to risk Cray nuking all those people by not picking up the weapon. While Alex doesn't want to assassinate people he kills and injures people pretty easily if they are the bad guys or are about to cause a lot of harm/get away.

This was basically all done to make Talia more of an overt villain, and even Morrison admits that they had forgotten key details of *Son of the Demon* when writing *Batman and Son.*  

So yes, there was a version of Bruce and Talia's relationship that was born out of geniune affection, albeit one that still ended in lies and deceit. However, in the current canon (if we ignore the whole *all things are canon* approach from the recent Infinite Frontier storyline), the only real relationship between Bruce and Talia did end with Talia drugging Bruce.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1637619466.0,,1637626942.0,0.0,{},hlp0916,False,t3_qzw4ml,False,t1_hlp0916,False,t3_qzw4ml,/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/qzw4ml/dc_has_batman_ever_had_a_true_relationship_with/hlp0916/,1645939698.0,10.0,False,True,False,AskScienceFiction,t5_2slu2,r/AskScienceFiction,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since losing at Chelsea on 23 October Manchester United have become the Premier League’s Invincibles, José Mourinho’s team being the only side to remain unbeaten in more than five months as the season enters its closing phase. Listen to the manager and this has been achieved despite a schedule that chalks up game No49 with West Bromwich Albion’s visit on Saturday. “I don’t think it’s funny some of my players in six weeks play 11 matches,” he had said before the international break.

United face a hardly credible nine matches during April so the manager has a point. Yet the high volume of football is because of United prospering under him. They were in four competitions until winning the League Cup in February and lost in the FA Cup just a fortnight ago. This has all given him time to try players in different competitions to assess who is worthy of the relentless Premier League challenge.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan is one who was substituted on debut at half-time of the September defeat against Manchester City but found a way back into the first team by prospering in the Europa League. The Armenian’s first goal came against Zorya in December, and since the Chelsea defeat a battle-hardened XI largely responsible for the 18-game unbeaten sequence emerged.

Mourinho expertly juggled lineups to ensure the following team operated most regularly in the league: David de Gea; Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Matteo Damian; Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick; Henrikh Mkhitaryan/Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford; Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Regular watchers over the 18-match stretch have been accustomed to United conceding very few – 11 in all – while also struggling to score – only 29 times in total. This is why the team, who are fifth, are so far behind Chelsea – 17 points – with eight of their 10 draws coming since defeat at Stamford Bridge. The glaring statistic is the paltry number of goals. In all there have been 42 in 27 league outings. Compare it to Liverpool’s 61, Chelsea’s 59, Tottenham Hotspur’s 55, City’s 54, Arsenal’s 56 and Everton’s 51. Bournemouth, down in 11th, have scored the same amount as Mourinho’s team.

So the key factor in the unbeaten run is a defence in which Rojo-Jones have emerged as the first-choice centre-backs, and Herrera has become a dominant midfielder. Both Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling have sustained injuries and may, in time, dislodge Rojo and Jones. But it is worth recalling Smalling-Bailly were the pair in place for the 4-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. And Mourinho’s trust in Rojo‑Jones has seen them become two of the six outfield players trusted most during the 18 matches, with 1,262 and 1,225 minutes respectively.

Herrera has played 1,320 minutes (behind only Ibrahimovic’s 1,440, Pogba’s 1,529 and De Gea’s 1,620) and his number of tackles – 43 – is the highest, with Valencia next on 29. The Spaniard has also created three league goals and his 1,202 completed passes is second to Pogba’s 1,345.

Herrera cannot be happy at failing to find the net in 18 games and neither will Pogba be content at only three goals. Mata, who has been allowed only 947 minutes, has chipped in with four.

This again points to the lack of goals being contributed from different areas of the side. Ibrahimovic’s role as totem and chief scorer – he has 11 in 16 appearances – is hardly unknown. Just how much he carries United, though – and why Mourinho is desperate for another elite finisher such as Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann – is illustrated by the Swede creating the most goals as well. His four assists are more than Wayne Rooney, Pogba, Herrera, Valencia (3), Mata, Anthony Martial (2), and Mhkitaryan (1). Ibrahimovic’s agent, Mino Raiola, is surely pointing to all of this during the negotiations with United over the No9 signing for another year


Rashford remains the great young hope but can a 19-year-old who has not scored in the league since September be relied upon next season?

Not in doubt is the spirit fostered by the manager. As Jones says: “It [was] good to go into the international break with a win and we are up to fifth. It shows the fight in the squad – we are prepared to fight for each other. You can’t buy that. It is in everyone. It rubs off on us from the manager. Whatever formation we play or the tactics we play, ultimately it is about the fight in every player and we are showing that at the moment. This season we have had times when we’ve had to dig deep; there is a lot of fight in that dressing room and it is positive.”

Mourinho’s team are now about to embark on April’s nine-match endurance test. After West Brom on Saturday at Old Trafford, Everton visit on Tuesday, before United go to Sunderland the following Sunday and travel for the Europa League quarter-final first leg at Anderlecht on 13 April. After that it is Chelsea and Anderlecht (each at home), Burnley and City (both away) before a breathless month closes with Swansea City’s arrival in M16 on 30 April.

As Mata says: “It’s a reality and we have to adapt ourselves, to give the best we have in the decisive spell of the season. I see these games as a challenge to show all the good things we’ve been working on, and I hope we can get good results too.”

United’s current unbeaten run is the best in the division since Sir Alex Ferguson’s side also managed 18 in March 2013. There are seven league fixtures in April. It is a big ask to make it 25 by 1 May.

But that is the challenge for Mourinho’s men as they seek the top-four finish that guarantees a Champions League play‑off place whatever their fortunes in the Europa League, which also offers a route into the competition.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1637450396.0,,False,0.0,{},hlfz2xa,False,t3_qyckn3,False,t1_hlfz2xa,True,t1_hlfxlb0,/r/soccer/comments/qyckn3/daily_discussion/hlfz2xa/,1645959051.0,1.0,False,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, this is offense only - and first threepeat Kobe was a good defensive player (he was pretty average to below average in the 2nd part of his career... but not so much that it stopped the team from winning)

I also think Kobe's playmaking is underrated.   He was similar to MJ in that regard where people just think about the scoring, but forget the assists combined with the excellent turnover economy (very key in Phil's system).

Kobe also won - even if we say Shaq was the man for the first 3 he was still the best player on back to back title teams... which is more than some of the guys on the list above him can say.  So he gets credit for that.

I really do think 8-15 is totally fair... and I do think guys like Steph and probably KD are going to end up ahead of him.  I mean is Kobe really that much better than Dirk?  He won more... but other than that I'm not sure.... and I'd probably put them around the same tier.",True,False,,,,,1.0,1637361645.0,,False,0.0,{},hlbdf01,False,t3_qxr2eo,False,t1_hlbdf01,False,t1_hlbc16p,/r/nba/comments/qxr2eo/why_is_kobes_claim_as_a_top_10_player_becoming/hlbdf01/,1645968905.0,6.0,False,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, if we have an older Batman the passage of time needs to be accounted for. Say Bruce became Batman at age 25. 

At 25- Lets say Bruce fought crime for 3 yrs by himself. After 3 yrs, he meets Dick and trains him to become Robin. Dick needs to become his ward so he can't be an adult. So, let's say Dick is 15 years old at the start of his crime fighting career.

Bruce -28, Dick-15. - Based on comics, Dick was Robin the longest, prior to Tim. So, let's give him 4 years as Robin.

Bruce -32, Dick-19. Dick leaves Bruce and the role of Robin behind. So, Bruce finds his replacement, Jason. Jason was Robin for a fewer number of years compared to Dick and Tim, and has to be taken in as his ward. So, let's say Jason is 16, was Robin for 2 years (Comics says 5 years, but the comics don't work on realism in regards to aging.

Bruce -34, Jason 18. Jason is then killed by the Joker.

Bruce -35 Let's have a mourning period for one year as Batman fights alone again refusing to work with another partner.

Bruce -36. The Bat-family begins to form. After a year let's say Bruce meets a 21 yr old Barbara Gordon. Trains her to become Batgirl. Let's say Babs has the longest career working alongside Batman prior to being crippled by the Joker (We'll, come back to when she becomes Oracle). 

Bruce -38, Babs -23. Bruce then meets Tim Drake. Again has to be at an age where he can be taken in as ward. So let's say Tim is 15. Tim also has the longest career being Robin, not counting Red Robin. So, let's say 5 years. 

Bruce -43, Babs -28, Tim -20. Let's say this is also when Dick reemerges at Nightwing. Dick is 30, factoring the time that has passed. 

Bruce -44, Babs -29, Tim -21, Dick -31. Let's also say Jason reemerges as the Red Hood as well. Jason is 28, factoring in real time, but could be biologically younger due to the Lazarus Pit. It's also around this time Bab's should have been crippled by the Joker and after a year takes on the monitor Oracle.

Bruce -45, Babs -30, Tim -22, Dick -32, Jason -29. Now we come to Damian, who should be the youngest Robin at the age of 10. Again, Damian has to be young enough to be taken in as Bruce's ward and adopted and claimed as his son. Bruce probably had small dalliance with Talia Al Ghul during his year of mourning after Jason's death. Tim then takes on the monitor of Red Robin.

Bruce -45, Babs -30, Tim - 22, Dick -32, Jason -29, Damian -10. Here's are primary key members of the family. 

Next we can look into Kate Kane, Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown. Let's say she's closer to the older members of the Bat-family so, but still new to crime fight so maybe she's 28. Cassandra and Stephanie are probably closer to Tim in age so let's say 21 and 22, respectively. 

Finally, let's look at Batwing, the Luke Fox version. Let's say Lucius Fox was much younger when he took on CEO duties for Wayne Enterprises. Maybe Lucius was 45, when Luke was born (not an unusual age for CEO's). Bruce probably just became Batman. 25 years later Luke then becomes Batwing. 

Bruce -45, Dick -32, -Babs -30, Jason -29, Kate -28, Luke -25, Tim -22, Steph -22, Cass -21, Damian -10. 

Lucius is probably around 70. I forgot to mention Alfred, who I pegged was a bit younger when Bruce started as Batman. So, let's say Alfred was 50, and after 25 yrs is sitting at a comfortable 75 years old.

[],False,,haytil,1387748815.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_eh0l9,False,False,"Thanks for your reply.  A lot to respond to here.

First, we should keep in mind that if DC removed Tom King from ""Batman"" because of lagging sales, DC's never going to come out and say that's the reason - that would be unprofessional.  And frankly, to save face, I find it unlikely that Tom King would admit that that was the reason either - both for his own reputation as well as to keep his story consistent with the big publisher that's still employing him for other projects, including his own custom Batman miniseries.  So when it comes to what they've said about it, you've got to read between the lines.

My knowledge in this case - about King's departure - is limited to comics behind-the-scenes reporting, so it's not personal knowledge, but my memory is that low sales was very much the driving factor.

&gt; You may not have been aware, but another factor which lead to Tom King's run being cut off early was that he wasn't willing to incorporate a specific tie-in event into his story. They had a big tie-in event planned which wouldn't have worked with the story he was telling, so unless ""Joker War"" was such a good idea that they cancelled all their plans just to let Tynion IV do whatever he wanted, then ""Joker War"" was that tie-in.

There was another, much larger event that would have happened before ""Joker War:""  ""5G"" (later retooled to ""Future State"").  Corporate shenanigans, interference, and high-profile departures ultimately somewhat scuttled the tie-in, which was going to be much larger and line-wide than what we ultimately got (so you can't just look at the finished product as being the candidates for what the ""event"" was).  So it's entirely possible that we're both right, here: A reason for King's removal was his run/presence being incompatible with a tie-in event (""5G""), and ""Joker War"" being an entirely unrelated, later idea from Tynion.

Keep in mind that DC has been going through a *lot* of shakeups coming from the top down, due to multiple mergers.

The large time gap between King's announced removal and ""Joker War"" also suggests they're unrelated events (18 months?).  DC also doesn't plan *that* far in advance, when it comes to tie-in events - and certainly there would be no reason to give King an extended period of time (multiple issues) to finish his current arc (""City of Bane"").  If J.H. Williams III's quick removal from ""Batwoman"" was any indication, DC has no problem cutting the cord fast and hard (they cut Williams' storyline off right in the middle, refusing to publish his written ending, despite already having received those drafts, edited to their editorially-mandated specifications).

&gt; That's not true. Tom King has stated repeatedly that he was always planning on the marriage going the way it went.

My impression was those comments were always about issue #50, not about the intended ending of the 100 issue run that we ultimately never saw.

&gt; (Besides, isn't your argument that DC lets the person running the flagship ""Batman"" series do whatever they want? You're making my argument now -- that they exercise a stricter control over the main title.)

To be clear, my argument has always been the following:

* The flagship ""Batman"" title generally has more creative freedom than the other titles (i.e., ""Detective Comics"")
* All titles have do have some limitations to their creative freedom, especially when it comes to changes in the status quo (character deaths, marriages, etc.)
* The pressure of needing to keep sales up incentivizes writers on ""Batman"" to make worse creative decisions for the sake of ""shock and awe""

&gt; Tynion IV is an incredible writer. ""Batman Eternal"" was terrible because Scott Snyder is an absolute joke whose ideas are impossible to take seriously.

My impression - and this comes from talking to Tynion personally - is that the day-to-day writing on ""Batman Eternal"" was performed by Tynion.  Snyder's name was attached to the project - though I'm not saying Snyder didn't have input on the project - because at the time, DC knew that ""Batman + Snyder's Name On Cover = Printing Money.""

Tynion has no problem throwing scenes or ideas into a comic book because it looks or seems cool, even if it doesn't serve the story.  I know this because he bragged about it to me (in his mind, this was a hallmark of a good writer, so he felt no shame about it) - and it doesn't strike me as something a good writer would do.

&gt; When Tynion IV is given good material to write, he does phenomenal. He can't spin gold out of garbage.

I don't understand what you're saying here.  Writers aren't given material, writers are the ones that come up with the material.  ""Batman Eternal"" being bad is on the writers first and foremost, it's not like they were adapting it from another medium.

&gt; No it hasn't. This is just factually incorrect on an objective level. After they gave Grant Morrison the keys to the company with his Batman run, they regretted their decision so much that they cancelled all their plans (you don't have access to the Letter Hacks columns since you don't read the monthlies, but they had plans in place which they were heavily promoting in the letters columns just before N52 started)

The New 52 and the reboot had nothing to do with regretting giving creative control of ""Batman"" to Grant Morrison.  They're completely unrelated.  And the fact that Morrison was given New 52 ""Batman Incoporated"" - and allowed to kill off a major character in the reboot, despite having an entirely separate book in the New 52 devoted to him and his relationship to Batman - suggests no such regret.

Yes, there were other plans before the New 52, and those were scrapped for the reboot, but the purpose of the reboot wasn't to simply justify not following through on plans that you claim DC regretted.

&gt; Then, after Scott Snyder, they gave Tom King permission to tell a specific story, before jerking him and his narrative around every which way, forcing crossover tie-ins with Monster Men and The Flash

Actually, not forcing King to write the tie-in stories is actually a sign of *more* creative freedom, not less.  He was essentially given a break several times (basically, providing a ""fill-in writer""), which probably was sorely needed by both writers and artists, given the twice-monthly schedule.

&gt; ...I'm fairly certain that killing Alfred was King's idea, and was surprised DC was OK with it....
&gt;
&gt;You're 100% incorrect about this matter. You can see the fear gas on the page when Bane breaks Alfred's neck -- his original plan, as he stated in an interview, was to have Bane use Scarecrow's fear gas to show Damian his greatest fear -- the death of Alfred. However, after Editorial saw the page where Bane snaps Alfred's neck, they gave Tom King a call and told him that he was changing his plans and killing Alfred, and he didn't have any choice but to go along with it.

I'll admit this is something I'm relatively ignorant about.  I tried googling and found a few references, but haven't yet found the direct interview about this matter.  I did just pull down my copy and I don't see any fear gas anywhere on the page.  What panel are you talking about and where is the fear gas?

""City of Bane"" is a real mess, though I don't blame King - it's clear he was forced to rush it and wrap it up by issue 85, when that definitely wasn't the plan.  So much happens ""off-screen"" and we're told about things that either make no sense or should have been shown directly.

&gt; This isn't true -- as I've stated before, Tom King was removed from the run because he wasn't willing to work a specific event tie-in into his story. The event tie-in in question must be Joker War, because no other event tie-in fits the timeline.

Again, the unseen, reworked ""5G"" is a better candidate for this theory.

&gt; Certain writers, like Grant Morrison, Scott Snyder, and Brian Michael Bendis, are given more creative freedom for the same reason that film studios give certain movie directors like Quentin Tarantino more creative freedom. Other writers, like Tom King, James Tynion IV, or anybody writing in the 2000s, are denied that creative freedom.

I think King's status is much closer to Snyder than Tynion.  Certainly King was a bigger name when he started on ""Batman"" than Snyder was when he started on ""Batman.""

My knowledge of Tynion and ""Joker War,"" as well as aspects of his writing process, comes from talking to Tynion personally.

My knowledge of King's removal from ""Batman"" is less personal and comes from behind-the-scenes reporting, regarding DC Editorial, fallout from the corporate mergers, the cuts in staff (from DC Editorial, both as a collective as well as specifically the likes of Didio, etc.), and putting some of those pieces together.

They had a big tie-in event planned which wouldn't have worked with the story he was telling, so unless ""Joker War"" was such a good idea that they cancelled all their plans just to let Tynion IV do whatever he wanted, then ""Joker War"" was that tie-in.

I don't feel like Googling exhaustively, but they mention this here:

https://www.denofgeek.com/comics/batman-tom-king-exit-explained/

&gt; Finally, DC Editorial was not OK with King marrying Bruce and Selina (the ultimate endgoal of King's run), as their stance on refusing to allow their major characters from being married has been made explicitly clear time and again. This friction certainly didn't help King's case in the eyes of DC when deciding whether to take him off or not.

That's not true.  Tom King has stated repeatedly that he was always planning on the marriage going the way it went.  This was the story he was telling, not a mandate from DC Editorial.  (Besides, isn't your argument that DC lets the person running the flagship ""Batman"" series do whatever they want?  You're making my argument now -- that they exercise a stricter control over the main title.)  I fully believe that DC wouldn't want Bruce to get married, but I also don't buy that Tom King is just lying about this being the story he intended to tell.  While it seems painfully obvious that Tom King doesn't plot out his stories ahead of time, it seems pretty clear that the story he was planning on writing involved Bruce and Selina *not* getting married.

&gt; I can't speak to ""Fear State"" and its quality of writing - I read the hardcovers, not the monthlies - but it doesn't surprise me if ""Fear State"" isn't written all that great. The truth is, Tynion isn't actually a good writer. His ""Batman Eternal"" work is garbage, he's constantly using deus ex machinas, and his original contributions to the Batman mythos tend to be quite boring. He has interesting ideas but he never actually explores them. His ""Detective Comics"" run was surprisingly good, given that it was coming from him, but it was never ""great,"" still suffers from many of his weaknesses as a writer, and the best parts of it are the parts that come purely from his love of the 90s/early 00s Bat-family status quo.

Tynion IV is an incredible writer.  ""Batman Eternal"" was terrible because Scott Snyder is an absolute joke whose ideas are impossible to take seriously.  When Tynion IV is given *good* *material* to write, he does phenomenal.  He can't spin gold out of garbage.  Anybody would've done terrible writing ""Batman Eternal"" because it was one of the most poorly thought out vanity projects I can imagine.

""The truth"" isn't that Tynion IV is a bad writer, that's *your* *opinion*.  You shouldn't use words like ""truth"" when you're talking about subjective judgments, it makes you seem like you don't know what you're talking about.  Some of these matters are objective ones -- why Tynion left the company, whether ""Joker War"" was an editorial mandate -- but whether or not a particular writer is any good is a matter of subjective judgment and critical analysis, not a matter of fact.

&gt; Are you referring here to the early 00s? If so, that was an entirely different period, editorially. Ever since Morrison's run, I think the relationship between Editorial and the flagship ""Batman"" writer has swung hard towards creative freedom for the writer, but that wasn't always the case.

No it hasn't.  This is just factually incorrect on an objective level.  After they gave Grant Morrison the keys to the company with his Batman run, they regretted their decision so much that they cancelled all their plans (you don't have access to the Letter Hacks columns since you don't read the monthlies, but they had plans in place which they were heavily promoting in the letters columns just before N52 started) and pulled Scott Snyder to reboot the Batman universe within the constraints of their editorial mandates (Batman had only been Batman for 5 years, Tim had never been Robin, Stephanie and Cassandra never existed, etc).  

Then, after Scott Snyder, they gave Tom King permission to tell a specific story, before jerking him and his narrative around every which way, forcing crossover tie-ins with Monster Men and The Flash, hitting him with ludicrous mandates last second, such as forcing him to kill Alfred or cutting his run 20 issues short.

Then Tynion was tapped to help write some big tie-in event (Joker War -- it's the only tie-in event it *could* *have* been, as Tom King's run would've been over by the time Fear State started), they wouldn't let Tynion tell the story he originally wanted to tell in ""Their Dark Designs,"" forcing him to rework the ending (and the entire point of the story), and I refuse to believe that it was Tynion's *creative* *decision* to keep spinning his wheels repeating the same Future/Fear State build-up and repeated exposition from April to October.  Say what you will about the quality of his writing, but he's certainly not *that* *bad* a writer no matter what you think.  The reason the entire last year of Batman comics has been the same issue over and over and over again was because DC editorial was guiding the direction of Tynion IV's run in order to coordinate it with their Future/Fear State tie-in plans.

&gt; I'm fairly certain that killing Alfred was King's idea, and was surprised DC was OK with it.

You're 100% incorrect about this matter.  You can see the fear gas on the page when Bane breaks Alfred's neck -- his original plan, as he stated in an interview, was to have Bane use Scarecrow's fear gas to show Damian his greatest fear -- the death of Alfred.  However, after Editorial saw the page where Bane snaps Alfred's neck, they gave Tom King a call and *told* him that he was changing his plans and killing Alfred, and he didn't have any choice but to go along with it.

Unless Tom King is a pathological liar, you're wrong on several of your points as taken directly from the horse's mouth.

&gt; I think a distinction has to be made between DC-wide events and Batman/Gotham-wide events. Editorial has mandates for DC-wide events, though the Batman family tends to be fairly sheltered from those in recent years (DC has wisely recognized that the Batman sub-universe should largely be left alone to do its own thing), while Batman-wide events are driven by the writers, not Editorial.

This isn't true -- as I've stated before, Tom King was removed from the run because he wasn't willing to work a specific event tie-in into his story.  The event tie-in in question *must* *be* Joker War, because no other event tie-in fits the timeline.  It's not as clear-cut and black-and-white as you're insisting it is.  Certain writers, like Grant Morrison, Scott Snyder, and Brian Michael Bendis, are given more creative freedom for the same reason that film studios give certain movie directors like Quentin Tarantino more creative freedom.  Other writers, like Tom King, James Tynion IV, or anybody writing in the 2000s, are denied that creative freedom.

You seem to be just *asserting* that things are the way you're saying they are, but I can point to direct quotes from the people involved that paint an entirely different picture.  How do you *know* that DC Editorial didn't push Joker War on Tynion IV?  I'm deferring to quotes from the people involved, you just seem to be ""telling it like it is"" but your arguments aren't qualified in any way.  

Do you have quotes from Tynion IV or somebody else in the business which would imply that I am incorrect?  I'm not asking you to pedantically cite your sources -- this is a casual conversation and I'm happy taking your word for it if you say that you remember somebody saying a particular thing.  That's mostly what I've been doing -- I don't feel like Googling every Tom King interview I've ever read/listened to in order to build my case.  But I just mean, you seem very confident in your assertion that I am wrong, and I'm curious where this confidence comes from.  How do you know that the things I've heard are false?  It's very possible that Tom King *is* a dishonest person (he did work for the government after all!  *ZING*!!), but I know for a fact that he has said the things I'm attributing to him.  I didn't come to the conclusion I came to out-of-the-blue, I came to this conclusion *because* of the things I've heard and seen about the inner workings of the company.  how did you come to your conclusions?

&gt; I think King was given as much creative freedom as Snyder, up until the point that he was yanked, and again, ""Joker War"" was Tynion's idea, not DC's.

I don't think King and Snyder were writing the same type of stories, so it doesn't really make sense to talk about whether they were given the same amount of creative freedom.  Tom King's intentions were to tell a very human story about Batman and his feelings.  Scott Snyder's intentions were to radically redefine the entire DC universe from the ground up.

Tom King was writing a small, low-stakes, low-impact story, and DC wouldn't even let Tom King *not* kill a particular character, or finish his run in the allotted time.  On the other hand, Scott Snyder has been consistently redefining everything we know about the DC universe on a weekly basis.  One moment Bruce Wayne has been Batman for 5 years and The Riddler did No Man's Land before No Man's Land, the next moment Dr. Manhattan and The Batman Who Laughs are giving Wonder Woman a magical guitar which gives Duke the power to see backwards, whatever that means.

-

A series of demonstrations will be held along the Border between the Republic and the North next week telling British prime minister Boris Johnson to “back off” on plans to trigger article 16.

The group Border Communities Against Brexit will protest at five locations on the Border in support of the Northern Ireland protocol.

It has accused the British government of damaging the peace process with its threats to suspend elements of the treaty, which has prevented a hard border in Ireland but created trade barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland.

Speaking on Saturday, chairman Damian McGinnity said: “Boris Johnson’s government has been pursuing a reckless course in negotiations with the EU around the protocol, including threats to trigger article 16.

“Recent British government statements and actions are posing a very direct threat to the peace process, the all-island economy and raising once again the horrific prospect of a return to a hard border in Ireland.

“We are calling on Boris Johnson to back off, and to protect and implement the protocol.”

Mr McGinnity said many in Northern Ireland believe the protocol is working, and has protected the region from the worst impacts of Brexit.

“Communities, businesses, workers, farmers and students along the Border want the protocol to be implemented in order to protect jobs, livelihoods and community life on this island,” he said.

“Businesses, manufacturers and farmers are benefitting from the protocol and thousands of jobs are being created and secured as a direct result of it.

“The protocol has mitigated the worst effects of Brexit for communities such as ours.

“The majority of people and political parties in the North opposed Brexit and support the protocol as the key mechanism to prevent a hard border and protect the all-island economy and Good Friday Agreement.”

*‘Dangerous rhetoric’*

He criticised the British government’s approach to the issue as damaging to the peace in Northern Ireland.

“The dangerous and inflammatory rhetoric emanating from Boris Johnson’s government is now undermining all of the progress we have made in recent years,” he said.

“They need to listen to the concerns of Border communities, to businesses and to farmers who will be devastated by any triggering of article 16.

“Communities along the Border are determined not to be dragged back to the past, it is shocking after years of Brexit uncertainty for Border communities that a deal which was signed only a very short time ago is being torn apart.

“We will not allow any reimposition of a hard border and the untold social and economic damage this would cause. We will not allow the peace process to be undermined.”

The group will stage demonstrations at Flurry Bridge in Carrickcarnon, Belcoo/Blacklion, Moybridge in Aughnacloy, the Lifford Bridge and Bridgend in Derry from 3pm on November 20th.

Mr McGinnity said: “We are asking everyone living along the Border, on either side, to make an effort to attend their nearest demonstration.

“We are calling on all trade unions, representative groups, civic leaders, sporting organisations and citizens to join with us on Saturday, 20th November, at 3pm to say loudly to Boris Johnson to back off and protect the protocol.”

Talks between London and Brussels over the contentious protocol remain deadlocked and there is speculation that the UK is poised to trigger article 16 in the coming weeks.

The UK government has set a December deadline for a resolution in talks on the protocol.

The arrangement effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market for goods, resulting in some checks for products crossing the Irish Sea from Britain.

But Mr Johnson and Brexit negotiator Lord Frost have argued the EU’s interpretation of the deal has led to difficulties.

The EU has presented a package it believes will eliminate the need for 80 per cent of checks, but the UK has insisted the oversight role of the European Court of Justice is removed, a move Brussels firmly rejects.

Mr Frost called for “new impetus and energy” to be brought to negotiations, which will continue in Brussels next week. – PA

I was chasing some nonsense with Impostor Iosefka, I apologize for that. She is almost certainly part of the Choir, and the Choir may have remained active to a lesser degree after being forced to leave the UCW.

My only real purpose for bringing it up was illustrating something we already seem to agree on: the fact that nobody appears to operate out of the UCW anymore. It has fallen to the Scourge. And, my purpose for doing that was to say that we don't have to find evidence of some large battle between the Choir and the School of Mensis in the UCW to prove that the School has been there. The Choir may have vacated the UCW before the School ever got inside. Either way, I still think there's a good amount of evidence to suggest that the School went to the UCW. There's the fact that we summon Damian to fight Ebrietas, the fact that Damian wields the Choir Bell, the fact that we find the Choir Bell in the Nightmare of Mensis, and the fact that Micolash wields Call and Augur. The fact that Call is referred to as a secret rite of the Choir only supports my point.

He also shows no interest in breaking into the UCW or the Church Workshop. The dude's just hungry, and we've gathered quite a bit of tasty blood for him in one convenient location. You can also send him to Iosefka anyways, so clearly he's not on a mission to reach Oedon Chapel. I will concede that the nature of his Beasthood screams Mensis experiments, because Bolt, but that does not imply that he works for them. Bolt can also be found in Loran. In fact his disgust with Hunters, and the number of Hunters Mensis appears to employ suggests to me that he would want nothing to do with the School.

Bloodborne-wiki refers to Church Servants only, I see no mention of Church Doctors in the Enemy section.

I'm not trying to say that there necessarily is a spy in the UCW. In fact there probably wasn't. I'm just trying to say that the dead Choir member in Yahar'gul is proof that Mensis was trying to get in there. That they were interested in gaining intelligence on the Choir, to learn their secrets. The One Reborn, the Nightmare of Mensis, and Micolash's posession of the Choir's mightiest spells all imply that they succeeded, and by that line of reasoning I settle on ""Mensis got the UCW key from the dead Choir member."" Mensis was clearly proficient at kidnappings, so maybe they never even tried to get a spy in there, maybe they planned to capture and interrogate a Choir member from the get-go, who knows. That detail is not important to establishing a timeline, so it doesn't really matter. What matters is the implication that Mensis used the Choir's knowledge to complete their nightmarish rituals.

Imposter Iosefka being ""active"" in Yharnam when we arrive also does not necessitate that the Choir is active. This is hard to wrap one's head around, but, like I said in another comment, I believe we are in a dream, and Bloodborne uses multiversal elements to both tell and to obfuscate its story. This dream can pull together nonconcurrent times and put them in the same space, allowing you to experience the game, your Hunter's reality, in the order that we do, when the actual historical order of events may have been quite different. Also, for clarity, here's the description of A Call Beyond:

""One of the secrets of the Choir.

Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a
lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the
outer reaches of the cosmos.

The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead
created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the
Choir's arsenal. 

At times, failure is the mother of invention.""

Call may ""now"" be a ""part of the Choir's arsenal,"" however, it was discovered by the Healing Church. We have no idea if the Choir was around for the full lifetime of the Healing Church. Meaning that Impostor Iosefka's affiliation with the Church, and apparent breadth of knowledge, is reason enough for her to have it. She does not necessarily need to be part of the Choir for her to posess Call. Augur was discovered at Byrgenwerth, so that's not Choir specific either. Impostor Iosefka not having Rosmarinus is a notable exclusion, because Rosmarinus is the only item of the ones you mentioned that specifically states that it is used by the Choir. The Choir were simply the ones guarding the Church's biggest secrets, the last of those to ""Fear the Old Blood."" Micolash had no such fear, and so arose the enmity between the two organizations.

I'm wasting my time explaining that, though, because the detail that is actually important here, imo, is that Iosefka, Yurie, and Edgar are incredibly far apart from each other and bear no ties or similarities beyond the fact that they all clearly served the Church at some point in time. They do not appear to be collaborating in any measure, at least not that we see, so I don't think we can really call them the Choir at this point, even if they were all part of it in the past. They are all individuals, acting on their own will, for their own curiosity/satisfaction, as far as we can tell. Maybe Yurie was sent to Byrgenwerth to try and protect what remained of Master Willem and of course Rom, but Damian would have defeated her and killed Rom, allowing Mensis to study the Blood Moon.

I still don't think that Edgar's presence in the Nightmare necessitates the continued operation of the Choir. He easily could've been cut off and stranded. The ruined UCW is the best, most concrete evidence I can give you that the Choir is gone, transformed, or dead, aside from a few scattered members who no longer seem to have a leader to report to.

When a Finder offers enrollment at Los Angeles' Academy of Superheroes, he jumps at the chance, believing training could be the key to changing his fate. His classmates despise him, the majority of his teachers want him expelled, and his mom's ghost hasn't said a word since reappearing when he was nine, but Damian isn't the kind to give up.

Even Linda and the twins share a lot of similarities to Iris and the tornado twins. Those differences may be seemingly superficial but it's the sheer quantity of them that draw the parallels.

I think you're forgetting about the huge difference between the types of stories Wally would go on versus Barry's. The initial Baron and Messner Loebs Run were very stripped down, a lot different from the silver age stories - delivering a heart to a hospital, winning the lottery and pissing it away because of his immaturity, laying the seeds in his character arc by Messner Loebs before Waid finishes it with RoBA and he blows the universe wide open with the Speedforce. Every new legacy character has that character arc that Wally goes through coupled with 'how do I live up to the title?' problem, but the most successful ones expand the lore and do so much more to make it their own. The Speedforce is what separated the Wally stories from Barry's (initially, before Rebirth). Jaime Reyes has the Beetle, Damian as Robin is so much different in drive and personality because of his connection to the league and the way he grew up that separates him from Tim, and then Kyle was the last GL ever who had to protect the universe on his own, separating his status quo from Hal's. Thats really what makes successfull legacy characters - a lore expansion. However so much of the TV show and modern Barry stories pull from this era of Wally stories, where modern Barry Allen stories don't really harken back to the pure fun and wild sci fi adventures of the Silver Age. 

As well, there's a whole plethora of things that make up modern Barry stories in the show and modern comics that take from Wally's run - The Flash Fam, The Speedforce, Black Flash, Savitar, Zoom, The New Rogues, The personality of the old Rogues, Thawne's origin story, Working with Star Labs, The Flash's relationship with Hartley Rathaway, etc. A huge chunk of what makes Barry's modern stories is this stuff - in fact two of them (Future Flash and Godspeed) are kind of just reruns of older Flash stories (Dark Flash and Zoom). The big difference is that Wally inherits Barry's suit and Rogues - and its a key point that Wally *inherits all this stuff*. Meanwhile post reboot when Barry came back a big chunk of the stuff that happened when he was gone was *retconned* into being Barry's stories ie being the first one to come back from the Speedforce alive. Arguably Barry's modern stories would never be as popular unless they did what they did - take the Wally material and rewrite some of these highlight moments to having been Barry's material.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1636166773.0,,1636167337.0,0.0,{},hji4vo9,False,t3_qngfed,False,t1_hji4vo9,False,t1_hjh2zot,/r/DCcomics/comments/qngfed/why_does_dc_hate_barry_allen_so_much/hji4vo9/,1646109372.0,3.0,False,True,False,DCcomics,t5_2qlmm,r/DCcomics,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite that neither really truly stagnated until about fifty years into their existence, and even as they relied on recycling those old characters, they still constantly introduced more that often became as or even more beloved than the older ones. 

Relying on old characters doesn't cause stagnation, stagnation is more a result when you dont have any stories to tell about any characters or else the way you introduced them causes stories to derail. 

That's the problem that plagues DC, Marvel, Star Wars, and others more than relying on old or new characters, as they bring in characters, both new and old, that cause entire storylines, character arcs, themes, motivations, and so on to derail as the added character causes issues. In DC you see this with the returning Barry Allen becoming the Flash, thus derailing the stories of every Flash and Flash associated character; but also with Damian when he was first introduced, as the dynamics and purposes of several key Bat Family members had to change for him to have narrative purpose. 

Moreover it should be kept in mind that every reader/viewer/player's experiences are unique. A huge chunk of the people into Age of Sigmar don't have interest in the older stuff, so to them characters introduced to the narrative from WHFB are just as new as characters like Gardus and Kragnos are.

That's the simplest definition.

&amp;#x200B;

Key aspect here: Defensive attention. There are no other qualifiers. It can be by ball handlers and guards such as Damian Lillard, or big men like Giannis. I'll give examples below and explain why Steph has so much gravity.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

Gravity is when say a ballhandler like Dame, runs around a screen, and TWO defenders come at him. Not one, but two. His scoring threat and shooting threat is massive so his ""Gravity"" is sucking up the attention of the defense. Defenders don't want Dame having a good shot, so they stick with him no matter what. Because 2 guys are going at Dame, somebody else is being left open.

Another example, gravity is when Giannis drives into the lane and 2-3 defenders come at him. He's a physical specimen, and he cannot be given an easy chance to drive, so his ""gravity"" sucks the attention of the defense. Because 2-3 guys are going at Giannis, somebody is being left open. An open shot in the NBA is incredibly powerful, which is why gravity is so important.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason you hear ""Gravity"" with Steph so much is because he has the largest gravity. This is for 3 reasons.

1. He is probably the best offensive player in the league. Defenses are insanely scared of his scoring, so his ""Gravity"" sucks defenders away from others because they want to stop his scoring.
2. He is by far the best shooter in the league and the greatest shooter of all time. Because he can shoot from so far away, defenses have to follow him no matter what, even if he's at the logo or sometimes even at the other side of the half court, he gets double teamed. His ""Gravity"" sucks defenders away from others because he can shoot so far away. This is tied to his offensive output.
3. He runs without the ball (off-ball) more than any player. This is what makes him special and it's tied again to the offensive output. He is constantly moving and running, and because defenses want to double him, it's just insanely hard to keep track of him. His potent offense forces defenders follow him everywhere, even off-ball, which makes his gravity way stronger. His ""Gravity"" forces defenders to keep up with him at all times. No other player in the league is like this, which is why you hear it most with Steph. A lot, possibly most offensive players just sit there and wait to get the ball back, which minimizes their ""Gravity.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Gravity doesn't just have to be in shooting and scoring. Playmaking gravity is also a thing. A defense could be worried about a player like Chris Paul's playmaking gravity, so they're overselling on the passing lanes, which can mess up the defense. Same with guys like Jokic and Lebron. Gravity is just defensive attention.

The defensive attention can be super subtle. Forcing another defender to look at the guy with gravity who isn't his man for 1 extra second can lead to the defenders man getting an extra step when driving to the rim. Gravity also comes into play with how defenders treat the PnR, whether they go over because the offensive player cannot have space, or they go under, because it doesn't matter if the offensive player has space.

Players who don't pose a strong offensive threat, such as driving or shooting, don't have much gravity. Defenders simply don't care that much about that player, and they care more about their more offensively potent teammates.

I'm mostly upset over the DC stuff because the guys playing the Batfamily were awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

Batman showed up in the hotel Ra's was staying at to menace him and rough him up a bit.  He allowed it and called off any League members that would try to defend him.  Even told Bruce that Talia asked about him often, and that if he truly ever wanted to stop me, he'd have to take my place in the League, and marry Talia.

&amp;#x200B;

Tim Drake as Robin (pre-Damian), he noticed some weird stuff going on, including excavation equipment in Gotham and started to investigate, dropping a rock down a hole, and even posted the formula that was going on in his head to analyze the distance the rock fell before the sound of impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Jason Todd was back in town, and Ra's showed up in his apartment, to remind him he always had a place in the League, despite Talia's actions being against his wishes, now that he was returned, the offer was open.  Jason was expecting assassins to come after him, so he was mostly relieved, until he realized Ra's was in Gotham with some sort of master plan, and knowing that Bruce wouldn't be happy to see him back in town, went to Dick instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Dick Grayson, currently Nightwing, had a tiny little apartment over the bar he worked in, and was back to staying in Gotham as he fell onto the trail of some shipments of Kryptonite (Lex Luthor was trying to get the League of Shadow to help him, Ra's instead had him escorted out of town, under thinly veiled threat of death).  Dick is surprised to find Jason in his home, the two catch up and call up Tim, who had more information.  The League dug deep into the bowels of the earth beneath Gotham.

&amp;#x200B;

Tim reports back his findings to Bruce, who, now knowing Ra's is involved, starts looking into Ley lines, realizing a Lazarus Pit may actually be beneath the city.  Meanwhile, a shipment of mining charges (drills with explosive charges) are stolen, forcing the team to split up.  Jason and Dick work together, realizing the bombs are being placed in key locations beneath the city.  Batman and Tim go to check out the dig site, and find that Ra's did indeed find a Lazarus Pit, and has been expanding it.  In an effort to bring down one of the greatest civilizations of all time, and save the people from illness and age, Ra's was going to drop all of Gotham into a Lazarus Pit.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan was for the Robins to disarm the bombs while Bruce and Ra's fought, but then they'd have another person to contend with.  Ra's, a few days earlier, had met a displaced orphan girl, who had been working with Deathstroke to try and bring down the Titans.  However her paths crossed with Ra's, and Ra's actually convinced her to join him to deal with the leadership of the Titans first.  The Robins.  So after deactivating the bombs, Terra was going to make a surprise appearance and try to bring down the city. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're following my [Grizzlies vs Trail Blazers prop tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/qgmiyz/comment/hi9vvbo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I mentioned how Portland does not have great rim protection, have been struggling on defence, and are experiencing some shooting woes. Last season, Portland were ranked 29th in defensive rating, and relied on their 2nd offensive rating to pull themselves out of the hole by having Damian Lillard put the Trail Blazers on his back.  
So far, Lillard has not been his usual self as he has encountered issues with shooting the ball from behind the arc (he has only made 2 threes on 24 attempts). Additonally, key contributer Norman Powell is currently listed as questionable on the injury report.

On the other hand, the Grizzlies offense has been on fire. Ja Morant is averaging 35 points a game, with his lowest scoring night at 28 points against the Clippers. Along with the 35 PPG, he is averaging 8 assists per game. De'Anthony Melton (18.3 PPG in 30.7 MPG) and Steven Adams (19 offensive rebounds in 3 games and averaging a career high 4.7 APG) have also been key contributers for the Grizzlies. For me however, sophomore Desmond Bane has certainly surprised me. He is averaging 19.3 PPG with roughly 30 minutes of game time per game for Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr. also deserves a mention, averaging 15.3 PPG and 6 rebounds. Their efforts have allowed the Grizzlies to become 1st in the league in offensive rating, whilst Portland are in the bottom half, sitting at 17th.

Looking at last season between these two teams, the Grizzlies only lost once to the Trail Blazers in 3 regular season games. Morant struggled with only 10 points in the 108-130 loss, whilst Jackson Jr. and Melton played off the bench with a combined 18 points as Grayson Allen and Kyle Anderson started over them (combined 15 points). With Jackson Jr. and Melton playing much better in the starting lineup instead of off the bench, along with Morant's hot streak, I don't see Memphis losing in similar fashion to Portland like they did in this particular game last season.

The thing about Florent bonking Damian with the statue, the defense does a lot of fuss about this issue, and it honestly became a near irrelevant plot-point that only existed to prove L'Belle was in the room. It also makes no sense for Florent to knock out Tenma especially since the latter was drugged with sleeping pills.!&lt; 

Two major problems that didn't even need to exist, to the point I would argue they are borderline plotholes, which is interesting since 5-2 should have been a really simple locked room mystery, so it felt the writers added things on and on just to make two days of the mystery. 5-2 is definitely my least favorite on AA until now, to the point I almost gave up on DD because of that case (though I'm having a lot of fun with 5-3 thanks god).

-

The government’s plan to regulate social media is being leaked by civil servants to former colleagues who work at Facebook, Westminster figures fear.

There is concern in government over the lack of oversight of officials who have quit Whitehall to join big tech firms.

A senior Facebook representative had been in a meeting and raised an issue about online harms that only a few officials knew about, according to a senior government source.

“The problem is that DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] officials think it’s their job to work there for four years and then go and get a job at Facebook,” the source said. “They don’t get scrutinised by Acoba except at the most senior level.”

The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets the appointments of former crown servants, only checks civil servants at director-general level and above. Its advice is non-binding.

More than a dozen policy officials have jumped ship to Facebook in the past few years reveals analysis by *The Times*.

At least two former DCMS officials have joined Facebook this year, according to records of job moves on LinkedIn.

Nicola Aitken, who led the department’s counter online manipulation team until February 2020, joined Facebook as a misinformation policy manager in May after a year at FullFact, the fact-checking website.

On her LinkedIn profile she said that, while at the civil service, she drafted policy for the online harms white paper, which was published in April 2019 and updated last December.

Farzana Dudhwala, who worked at the office for artificial intelligence within DCMS and then at the government’s centre for data ethics and innovation, joined Facebook in January to work on AI policy and governance.

There is no suggestion that any of the individuals named are soliciting information from former civil service colleagues.

*The Times* reported in 2020 that Facebook had [recruited ten former policy officials](https://archive.md/eoyzt) since the start of 2019, including three senior regulatory staff from DCMS.

Senior representatives from Facebook, including Antigone Davis, its global head of safety, and Rebecca Stimson, its UK director of public policy, will give evidence to the joint committee scrutinising the Online Safety Bill on Thursday.

Labour has called on ministers to introduce criminal sanctions for tech company bosses who fail to tackle harmful or illegal content.

At prime minister’s questions last week, Sir Keir Starmer urged Boris Johnson to bring the bill to parliament before the end of the year and said that if he did Labour would support it.

The death of Tory MP Sir David Amess after being stabbed at a constituency surgery has renewed pressure to address the availability of extremist content online. Police have charged a 25-year-old man with murder and preparation of terrorist acts.

Julian Knight, Tory chairman of the DCMS select committee, said: “Any perceived cosiness between the likes of Facebook and civil servants has the potential to undermine the new online harms bill and regulatory regime.

“This frankly is too important to have anything done other than by the book. I trust ministers will take this seriously.”

Damian Collins, the Tory MP who chairs the Online Safety Bill committee, said: “The UK will lead the world in creating a comprehensive regime for online safety . . . There is nothing that Facebook can do to stop the government and parliament from creating a regulatory regime to make social media safer.”

Sue Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “These are very serious allegations which suggest that big tech are getting privileged access to civil servants and information off the back of the revolving door, and they need a full investigation.

“The revolving door regulator, Acoba, needs far greater powers, an expanded remit, and more resources if it’s going to prevent this kind of thing happening.”

Facebook said: “Our policy teams play a key role in developing and applying Facebook’s policies such as our community standards, which set out what is and isn’t allowed on our platforms.

“Having people with a range of expertise helps ensure that those policies and rules are effective and up to date. Facebook has actively called for new regulations to set high standards across the internet and so that private companies aren’t making so many of these important decisions alone.”

Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee and whistleblower has warned that [Mark Zuckerberg is “unaccountable”](https://archive.md/e5MRU) as he holds a majority of Facebook’s voting shares.

Haugen has made numerous claims about the tech giant since releasing internal research documents that she copied before leaving her job in the company’s civic integrity unit.

She has previously alleged that Facebook’s platforms “harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy”.

Haugen, who will speak before MPs and peers scrutinising the draft Online Safety Bill in Westminster today, told [*The Observer*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/facebook-boss-not-willing-to-protect-public-from-harm): “Right now, Mark is unaccountable. He has all the control. He has no oversight and he has not demonstrated that he is willing to govern the company at the level that is necessary for public safety.”

She added: “I believe in shareholder rights. The shareholders, or shareholders minus Mark, have been asking for years for one share one vote. And the reason for that is, I am pretty sure the shareholders would choose other leadership if they had an option.”

Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, has rejected the claims made by Haugen, saying her attacks on the company were “misrepresenting” the work it does.

The problem? Well, all 50 of the players who made the 50th Anniversary Team back in 1996 were grandfathered in, leaving only 25 slots left for players who hit their prime between 1996 and 2021. And players in the modern era are a lot better than players from the 60s, where there were fewer teams, players were less athletic, and rules were much more primitive. Some dismiss the 60s and 70s basketball legends for playing against ""plumbers and milkmen"", ie guys who didn't spend their lives training for basketball like in today's era, where even the worst players who get cut in training camp are elite athletic specimens who could wipe the floor with you in the gym.  

Anyway, as expected, there are some pretty big snubs, the most notable being Dwight Howard. In recent years, Howard has developed a reputation as a headcase and has bounced from team to team, but in his prime (late 2000s to early 2010s), he was a dominant defensive force of nature and an annual MVP candidate who led his team to the Finals. He has 8 All-Star appearances, 3 Defensive Player of the Year awards, 8 All-NBA selections (including 5 1st team), and five rebounding titles. The general consensus is that he was more deserving than players such as Damian Lillard (who's known for his deep game-winning shots but has performed poorly in the playoffs otherwise), Anthony Davis (who has languished on a borderline-playoff team for most of his career), and Carmelo Anthony (a volume scorer who is notoriously bad at defense and has seen very little playoff success).  

Other possible snubs include Tony Parker (6-time All-Star, second best player on a dominant Spurs team that won four championships), Klay Thompson (three championships, a key player on what is considered to be the greatest team of all time, and arguably the second best shooter in the history of the NBA), Vince Carter (a 20 year career with 8 All-Star appearances), and Pau Gasol (6-time All-Star, second best player on a team that won two championships).",True,False,,,,,0.0,1634926489.0,,False,0.0,{},hhneq4p,False,t3_qa0e8y,False,t1_hhneq4p,False,t3_qa0e8y,/r/HobbyDrama/comments/qa0e8y/hobby_scuffles_week_of_october_18_2021/hhneq4p/,1646684023.0,50.0,False,True,False,HobbyDrama,t5_k4fie,r/HobbyDrama,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,

We now have this suicide squad game, but WB were teasing a different Suicide Squad game in Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate. That game was allegedly cancelled because it was in development hell.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Back in December 2016, Jason Schreier reported for Kotaku that WB Montréal had cancelled their unannounced Suicide Squad game. There had been rumours before that the studio were working on a title about the Squad, but this was the first time it was ever confirmed outside of a comment here or there from DC writer Geoff Johns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Schreier's report mentions that it was at this time that Montréal moved on to their Damian Wayne Batman title, but not before spilling the beans on what went on behind the scenes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The game was said to have a co-op focus, but ostensibly ""failed to impress"" Warner Bros. management, which eventually resulted in its cancellation, and Montréal shifting their full attention to the Damian Wayne concept, which had started development earlier that year. Schreier also notes how this followed a ""turbulent"" few years at the studio, with multiple key members departing, including Arkham Origins creative director Eric Holmes, who swapped WB for DICE in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;Story-wise, there isn't much to go off on what Suicide Squad would've been like. **We can only assume from the hints in Origins and its handheld counterpart, Arkham Origins: Blackgate, that the team would've comprised Deathstroke, Bronze Tiger, Deadshot and Rick Flagg Jr. Amanda Waller would've also had a key role, while Harley Quinn features in multiple leaked images of the game's concept art, pictured here above and below**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Getting the timeline for Suicide Squad right is tricky, but if we take Johns' comments as fact, then it appears to have been in development at the time of Montréal's launch in 2010.  
&gt;  
&gt;Montréal is and was a big studio, so they would've been developing Suicide Squad and Arkham Origins in tandem - hence all the links between the two - but that also raises an interesting problem. After Origins, the Arkham formula was well established; if Suicide Squad was meant to be a co-op shooter along the lines of Destiny or Borderlands, would fans have been as receptive as they would've been to one with a more linear focus? It's hard to tell. Rumours have even stated the project tried to pivot to Arkham-style gameplay before being cancelled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, without any concrete information, WB's cancelled Suicide Squad game will continue to be a mystery. Supposed marketing materials that advertised the title were leaked in April 2019, claiming that Gotham and Star City would be playable locations. The veracity of those leaks is questionable at best (especially when you consider the game was cancelled over two years prior), but with both WB and Rocksteady seemingly pivoting to games-as-a-service (more on that later), one has to ask if elements of Suicide Squad will be incorporated into one of the studios' upcoming DC titles.  
&gt;  
&gt;For one reason or another, the project just wasn't to be. And with Rocksteady then primed to conclude their Batman series with Arkham Knight, WB needed another studio to carry the bat-shaped torch...

Sometime after this rocksteady made their own game, and they included Suicide Squad members that died in arkhamverse prequel tie-ins.

Tim was a founding member of Young Justice and was for a long time a member of the Teen Titans too with his own relationship there with Wonder Girl.

For sure, Grayson does not appear smarter or more technical (even shown to be akin to a Luddite in terms of technology- bit strange). Still a genius level intellect and shown to be “just under” Batman consistently, without penalising his character for that. 

I mean yeah, it’s all down to whoever’s writing Batman, his top feats are more often than not the pinnacle of humanity due to his longer and more stories exposure as a main hero, but I’d say to give Nightwing a good read, it shows how “close” those two are in terms of raw ability and skill since this continuity reset.

Currently Dick is doing feats even Batman is warning against due to unacceptable risks, like falling from space and pushing his body limits. Strength and mind training is also mirrored during this new run! He’s taken Bruce’s advice and mentoring as a strict regiment. That’s why I would recommend the current run, to see how they’ve progressed Nightwing as a character to be the same as Bruce (but distinctly different in key areas and personality!).

But you’ll be happy to hear that they do enough to separate Nightwing and shown his progression arc during this reboot to show he’s more competent in different ways and less in others to Batman. He’s more of a Jack of all trades, master of none type of character and shown to be getting better and better as the story goes on.

Also with recent story arcs, Bruce, Batgirl and Damian are all fawning at how close Nightwing is to Bruce’s current skill level (some stating they’re evenly matched) and even discussing the potential he has to be better (hence the “better than Batman title”). I’m not ever saying that that is the case, just the way the current runs are being depicted in DC continuity, but if we go off raw feats alone, Batman wins hands down throughout the multiple canons of the character. 

Personally, my head canon is the only reason why Nightwing is edging closer in skill and talent is because his sales on his recent comics (that aren’t the Ric run) are catching up to the heavy hitters like teen Titans and justice league and is DC’s 3rd most profitable character last I checked.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1634235446.0,,False,0.0,{},hgn2d8f,False,t3_q7lszt,False,t1_hgn2d8f,True,t1_hglh1gt,/r/batman/comments/q7lszt/my_nightwing_collection/hgn2d8f/,1647584826.0,1.0,False,True,False,batman,t5_2qqt8,r/batman,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:  
\-Myth will, by and large, offer a superior offensive game plan--the mere existence of Amelia versus no sharpshooters on Council means spacing.   
\-Myth can run four out ""Virginia-style"", Council cannot, unless either or both of Kronii/Fauna become a 38%+ shooter from 3P-range in the post-season.  
\-See all those tall guys on Council? Long, strong, equals great team defense. The only real comparable element on Myth to Council's defensive game-plan is Ina, if you consider her tentacles as allowing her to have that kind of off-ball impact.  
\-Taller Council players means they can clean the glass and rebound better as well.  
\-TL;DR: Myth will win games by hitting jump shots and drawing Sana/Mumei out of the key, Council wins games by leveraging their superiority in forcing turnovers and low-percentage shots.   


COUNCIL PLAYER ANALYSES AND PRO COMPARISONS:  
\-Gawr Gura, obviously, goes at the Point Guard position. They are usually, the smallest and most offensively cunning players on the floor. We will not talk about Magic Johnson or Ben Simmons as pro comparison, as Gura's kayfabe includes neither HIV nor prolific cowardice in the restricted area. Pro comparison might be Marcus Smart of the Boston Celtics. Gura is [presumably from New England or grew up elsewhere raised by Boston sports fans (FENWAY FRANKS FTW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J1976edyGQ), so I picked the floppiest player on BAWSTAN's roster to go with a literal fish out of water. Everyone loves and trusts Gura, and Smart is [loved and trusted by all.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ef_Uct-UYAEI1bn.jpg) Not sure if she can be a prolific scorer or shooter at the position, a-la Damian Lillard or Trae Young, but as long as she can throw up 6.5+ APG, Myth is gucci at the 1.  
\-Watson goes at the 2, since she's the best shooter, and should go on the wing. Taller than Gura by a wide enough margin to prevent an undersized backcourt. She doesn't need to defend super well, just hit her shots and do a better job than the last season's Utah Jazz on the perimeter. (&gt;giving up 39 points to best boi Terance Mann in a game 7 versus a Kawhi-less LAC)  
\-Ina at the 3. This is literally just ""big tentacles means long wing defender"". I have nothing else to say about her here except ""hey it's Korean Robert Covington in an anime girl body"".  
\-Kiara is now a slashing, defensive-minded Power Forward. Good on-ball, might not excel at team defense. Sword in costume = big slasher, hopefully she's a good secondary playmaker at the position, to facilitate EnMa's DHO and Drive/Kick plays. Fleet-footed Al Horford-lite?

You're missing the point here. The whole reason Clark Kent being Batman makes sense is because his face is partially covered, leaving room for identity-concealing measures--meanwhile, Superman has his whole-ass face exposed all the time.

There's no way Superrnan's gonna be someone as well-known as Lex Luthor or Bruce Wayne, or even someone Clark Kent's level. If he were famous enough to have his face recognized, he wouldn't be going out without a face covering. Plus, his job would have to flexible enough to allow for him stepping away and Superman-ing at a moment's

If Superrnan has a secret identity--and that's a big ""if"", I mean, the guy's an alien so who knows what his lifestyle deal is--it's gonna be a nobody, someone whose face can't be connected to his by the general public. Some guy living in his basernent, maybe, or an Uber driver who keeps fielding ""Hey, you look like Superrnan!"" comments.

Not Lex Luthor or Brucey boy, c'mon. The tabloids would've been all over it if that were the case.

[],False,,hatefulone851,1504054913.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c5py8iu,False,False,For me it’s Thomas Wayne killing Alfred. The whole thing with him. The relationship between Bruce and his parents is so important. And the letter Bruce gets from Thomas from the flash is so important to him. It provides a connection between father and so. That each never thought they’d get but doesn’t get rid of the overarching cause. And the. Thomas was supposedly killed with his universe. Giving Bruce another loss but keeping that connection. But the. They brought him into the main universe and that got messy. Same with brining Superman’s father back. The death is said parents and the legacy they left behind is key to those two characters. The emptiness from it is key too. And by bringing them back that part that makes those characters is gone. Yes there’s potential to build a relationship but still. Both become villains and go against their kids more thomas than Joe el. But Thomas’s killing of Alfred crosses a line and it ruins the significance of that letter and their connection. Also all the development of and training of Damian just goes away and he just rushes in to fight ignoring everything. And the impact doesn’t even have enough time to really hit because joker happens right after so Bane and Thomas are forgotten and the significance of the event is overshadowed and both don’t look as impressive if the city gets taken over one after another so quickly. But anyways the Thomas Wayne thing would’ve been ok if he’d stayed away or just been around for a little bit. But having him be a villain in a huge arc is an issue.

Knicks president Leon Rose said Friday he was happy with how free agency played out, but didn’t sound like a man who is done shopping.

Breaking his 14-month media silence in a 40-minute chat with a small group of writers at the team’s Tarrytown complex, Rose said he’s thrilled 2021’s free agency established “continuity and flexibility’’ and feels the Knicks are in position to get even better. The Knicks finished 41-31, earning the fourth seed in the playoffs.

Rose, who hadn’t spoken publicly since introducing Tom Thibodeau as head coach on July 30, 2020, said the club will remain “aggressive.’’

Though they won’t have cap space in 2022, the Knicks still are attempting to make a blockbuster trade with a host of disgruntled stars potentially looming, including Damian Lillard, Zion Williamson, Ben Simmons and Karl-Anthony Towns, who was Rose’s former client at Creative Artists Agency.

We’re gonna be aggressive as far as knowing what’s going on and as far as being on top of things and looking at opportunities,’’ Rose said. “But at the same time, we’re going to be prudent and disciplined in decisions that we make that are going to take into account positives and negatives, short term, long term, all those factors in a decision-making process.’’

That said, Rose thinks the Knicks will still take a step forward in 2021-22 after using their league-high cap space to net a new backcourt of Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier and re-sign Derrick Rose, Nerlens Noel and Alec Burks.

“Last season was definitely a successful season,’’ Leon Rose said. “Most importantly for us, we built a foundation. Thibs did an incredible job building that culture and foundation. [Coach of the Year] was a very well deserved honor. I’m proud of that and proud of him.

As we went into the summer, in order to build on last year, continuity and stability were two important factors in what we did. In doing all this, we’re always looking to get better and we want to remain flexible and we’ve done that.”

Rose noted the club has 15 draft picks across the next four drafts — including six first-rounders. Those are key assets in a potential big trade.

A key to the stability was inking All-Star Julius Randle to a long-term contract extension while bringing back Rose, Burk, Noel and Taj Gibson, the Knicks president said.

We wanted to bring back the core leaders of the team,’’ Rose said, “Veteran leaders of the team that were free agents. To be able to bring back Derrick, heart and soul, his impact was obvious. He’s so important.

Alec Burks, a guy who’s done it all for us, Swiss army knife, hit big shots. Noel, another guy who stepped in last year and did an incredible job for us, anchored our defense. Those three guys we got back on multi-year deals, continuing that continuity. And to bring back Taj Gibson, warrior, incredible professional.’’

Rose said he won’t “predict’’ when the Knicks will become NBA title contenders but Thibodeau said the first order of business is developing from within and winning to make the Knicks an attractive place to play.

“Now we have an All-Star [in Randle],’’ said Thibodeau, who hadn’t talked to the media since June’s Coach of the Year press conference. “So hopefully we can develop another one, or another guy can make that jump.

But I think getting started as a team last year, getting credibility by the degree of how hard and how together we are, it makes it appealing for other people to look at us. But we have to win.’’

n hiring the right coach and structuring a club that broke a seven-season playoff drought, Rose has made a smooth transition from agent to executive.

“I think being an agent gives me a great perspective from the other side of the table and allows me to have a greater understanding of the things we come up against every single day and the way the other people think,’’ Rose said. “I think it’s a huge benefit.’’

Rose has taken offense that he prefers players from his old agency at CAA and from Kentucky because of his close ties to former client John Calipari.

“No doubt CAA has a lot of good players, Kentucky has a lot of good players,’’ Rose said. “As far as our decision-making, we’re going to make the best decisions for the team.

“And another benefit is — as much as we were competitors — I have a great relationship with a lot of agents and understand them. We’re going to deal with every single agency out there.’’

Rose joked about his silence, singling out a reporter he said probably knows the exact number of hours since he last spoke.

“I know you guys have been looking for me for over a year,’’ Rose said. “I was never one to be out in front in the media as an agent. I usually was behind the scenes. I’ve kind of taken that approach since I’ve been here. Thibs has done a great job being a spokesperson for us. That’s worked really well.’’",True,False,,,,,0.0,1632567019.0,,False,0.0,{},he7gimr,True,t3_pv4gc6,False,t1_he7gimr,False,t3_pv4gc6,/r/NYKnicks/comments/pv4gc6/leon_rose_wants_to_be_aggressive_as_knicks_hope/he7gimr/,1647776453.0,41.0,False,True,False,NYKnicks,t5_2rur5,r/NYKnicks,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,,rectangularjunksack,1428540002.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_mskz2,False,False,"IMO the answer to this question isn't as simple as a lot of the answers here would suggest. Different rappers (and different raps) lie at different places on a spectrum from ""speech-like"" to ""singing-like"" in their use of pitch. To take one of your examples, Eminem sounds pretty ""singing-like"" to me in the chorus of Real Slim Shady where a lot of the lyrics sound, to me, like they're delivered at on the root note of the instrumental (but... is he singing?). In the rest of the track the use of pitch is less centered around specific notes.

Jamaican rap (toasting) would be an example of, generally, extremely ""singing-like"" rap where most of the words are ""pitched"" at specific notes. Example - The Master Has Come Back by Damian Marley, the lyrics in the verses sound like they're a minor third above the root note of the instrumental - they're pretty much sung, but I'd probably still consider it to be rap.

THAT SAID, I would have to say that for the most part, you probably don't need to worry about (or consciously think about) being ""in key"" when you rap. Even in the example above, I really doubt Damien was thinking ""hey I think I'll pitch the verse a minor third above the root note"". Besides, plenty of rappers (most?) stay over at the ""speech-like"" end of the spectrum, just as plenty of rap beats have no obvious tonality to them. Just as our speech naturally contains different pitches, the use of pitch in rap probably comes naturally in pretty much every case.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1632231504.0,,1632251181.0,0.0,{},hdpsvaf,False,t3_pscdes,False,t1_hdpsvaf,False,t3_pscdes,/r/musictheory/comments/pscdes/do_i_need_to_rap_in_the_same_key_as_the_beat/hdpsvaf/,1650081246.0,6.0,False,True,False,musictheory,t5_2qrjj,r/musictheory,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It comes as highly-rated former Lions midfield assistant Dale Tapping attracts serious interest from Essendon and Collingwood about potential roles for next season.

The off-field assistant coaching moves this season have already been significant with still plenty more movement to come.

If Carroll decides to move to Moorabbin after one year with the Magpies, it would reunite him with Saints coach Brett Ratten, with whom he worked at Hawthorn under Alastair Clarkson.

St Kilda is looking to appoint a full-time head of development, with the club keen to invest heavily in this area after the serious disruption to the second-tier level across the past two seasons.

Ratten told the club’s website recently he wanted someone to “own” the development space.

The Saints have already added former Cat Corey Enright to their assistant coaching panel.

Carroll spent a decade at Hawthorn where he coached Box Hill Hawks to a VFL flag in 2013, while serving as an assistant coach to Clarkson as well as head of development.

Tapping had been offered a two-year deal to stay with the Lions, but chose to return to Victoria for family reasons.

In terms of a Bible Belt, not really. There are religious communities around the country. Here, because of the significant decline of the Anglican Church, Catholicism is the most populous denomination. Catholics do tend to predominate in some regions, and are a minority in others. But as for a region known for religious people? No. 

In terms of influencing politics, New Zealand has had religion influence politics pretty much since it was granted self governance. Among the less well known relationships but certainly one with significant political influence is that of the Labour Party and the Rātana Church, the latter a pan-iwi political movement in addition to a syncretic Christian church. The church had managed to get MP's elected to Parliament, and officially joined the Labour Party in November 1936. In doing so, the Prime Minister at the time, Michael Joseph Savage, was tasked with restoring land taken by the government to Māori, the broken promises successive governments had made under the Treaty of Waitangi, and the mana of Māori as a people. These were presented as symbolic gifts and these were buried with him when he died in 1940. 

Since then, the Rātana Church has elected a handful of MP's to Parliament under the Labour Party banner, the last of whom served between 1999 and 2005. While no Rātana ministers currently serve in Parliament, every year on January 25, politicians from all parties gather at Rātana marae to mark the birthday Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana, the founder of the Rātana Church, which has become a tradition that generally begins the political year in New Zealand. It's probably not what you're looking for, but it's certainly the case of religious influence on New Zealand's politics and creating a somewhat unique political tradition. 

In terms of more American-style religious influence in politics, it does exist in some manner but it's very much more watered down, although in recent years the main right-wing party in New Zealand has seen the greater influence of the religious right over more moderate factions. Generally speaking, the religious influence predominantly comes from the centre-right to right-wing National Party who has a mixture of mostly traditionalist and conservative Catholics and other Christian denominations within the party. Some are more overt about their religious beliefs than others, and they represent a very conservative faction within the party. Former leader Simon Bridges is one of these religious conservatives who, while he hasn't made much in the way of public statements about religion, definitely allows it to influence his voting in Parliament, and the influence of MP's like him has definitely meant that we've often stumbled when substantial progress is being made. It's rather pertinent you ask this, as New Zealand is currently looking to pass legislation that would outlaw conversion therapy, and Bridges is one of the key National MP's who has been arguing against the legislation, making the argument that it would criminalise parents ""just having conversations with their kids"". Another MP that's seeking to make inroads with religious influence is former Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon, who is what I have termed an ""out and proud Evangelical"" and is currently being set up to take over the party at some point in the future.

Of course, National is not the only party to have religious conservatives in it. Labour has conservative MP's as well, including my local MP Damian O'Connor, who as far as I can remember is also Catholic. Included within the likely religious and socially conservative Labour MP's include many (but not all) of it's current Pasifika MP's who represent deeply religious and very conservative Pasifika communities in our largest city. Interestingly, on the topic of abortion which was fully decriminalised last year, my local MP voted in favour of legalisation, while two Maori and two Pasifika MP's voted against it from Labour. 

Finally, the kind of rhetoric you see from the religious right in the United States does exist here, but it's very much limited to certain fringe parties that don't garner many votes. There have also been some overtly religious parties in the past, a not insignificant number of them coming from Destiny Church, a fundamentalist Pentecostal church that has been lead by Brian Tamaki since it's foundation and has developed a reputation in New Zealand for being very much based on fundamentalist moral interpretations of the Bible as well as a cult of personality surrounding Tamaki himself.

Idk, maybe OP didn't mean to give it to him. FFH was him out of his element and with his connection to Stark I assumed he'd have it. Hey, if you can back up Damian beating him even in the Iron Spider then that just proves even more so that Spider-Man is too weak to beat the batfam. And in a funny bit of coincidence/irony whatever you wanna call it...enhancing the opposing sides argument and still dismantling it is referred to as the Iron Man argument. 
        
&gt;Where I used the auto-fire logic. Damian has KO’d ppl with [superhuman stats](https://m.imgur.com/tmjL8ao?r) before.
    
Okay? I don't know shit about this dinosaur man. What makes him more impressive than Spider-Man? Batman is superhuman, Krillin is superhuman, and Escanor from the Seven Deadly Sins is superhuman. Each of these characters have drastically different levels of strength despite being superhuman. 
     
&gt;Yep, zero damage. So little damage that he couldn’t even hear when he hit the ground. Here’s the scene, Vulture could’ve killed him if he wanted: https://youtu.be/JtaQDMtoygY
    
Yeah, I watched the seen. I meant visible damage. Obviously the plane crash impacted him to some regard, but he wasn't injured externally. My fault for wording it incorrectly. 
    

&gt;Lol, he had a small section of a school fall on him, and he wasn’t lifting everything, only the stuff on top of him.
     
He had a building collapsed on top of him and I never said he lifted it all up, just that he had to exert and strain himself after being injured and right before he was involved in a plane crash. 
     
&gt;Spider-Man catching his arm is a feat, but when bloodlusted WS would be on par with him
    
You wanna back that up? 

&gt;he overpowered Iron Man and crushed his armor on multiple occasions.
     
Which only proves how strong a person capable of casually catching his arm and moving it as he wills is. This isn't a point in Damian's favor, it's a point in Spider-Man's if you find his feats against Iron Man impressive. 
     

&gt;Spider-Man also lost a 1v1 to Captain America in that same movie, who WS fought evenly with.
     
Spider-Man was highly inexperienced, star struck, and told strictly to web up people from a distance and viewed Cap as someone simply misguided but still an ally. He also wasn't defeated, Cap was just smart enough to drop something heavy enough on him that Spider-Man had to stop fighting. Then Cap ran off after asking where he lived. If that doesn't tell you how much this wasn't a real fight, then I don't know what will. 
     
&gt;That’s just rude and counter-productive
     
Idk man, the second I said something your responses actually included some level of scans and proof at all. Might not be as counterproductive as you think. You're still not filling in context though.  
     
&gt;No, Damian can [hold his own](https://m.imgur.com/nRAlvDI?r).
    
Wow, a creature. Amazing. 
    
Am I supposed to be impressed by this? Why? You never give context to any of your scans that involve scaling. It's annoying. This is what I was just talking about and what I mean by terrible job. You're not selling your character. I don't believe Damian is a badass because you're not making him seem like one. 
     
&gt;So did you, if you even had one.
    
No, I'm pretty sure I've made it very clear why, based off of the minimal amount of feats you've provided me, MCU Spider-Man is able to beat Damian in a 1v1 handily. 
    

&gt;MCU Spider-Man doesn’t outclass them in speed, Batman can casually [move as a blur](https://m.imgur.com/a/sN5WY) and sees bullets in [slow motion](https://m.imgur.com/a/2WQfm). 
    
Moving as a blur means nothing. 
     
Seeing bullets move is not the same as reacting to them as if they moved in slow motion nor is it akin to dodging size plus sources of fully automatic gunfire in an enclosed hallway while all of your senses are shut off. 
     

&gt;Peak humans in different settings aren’t equal to each other.
    
Well it's a good thing you've compared the Batfam to Cap in terms of physicals, now we know for sure Spider-Man completely outclasses them. 
    

&gt;Lol, you claimed MCU Spider-Man can lift buildings
    
You wanna quote that? 
    
&gt;and no-sold a plane crash
     
I misstyped. He had no external injuries after the plane crash. 
     
&gt;where he couldn’t even hear despite only rolling against the ground.
     
You linked the scene yourself, how are you to trying to downplay it this much? Cap only got punched once by another dude and was knocked out!(by Thanos) Hulk was defeated in one punch Tony Stark(after being thrust through a building and calming down after recovering from mind control) 
    
You can downplay scenes however you want, but Spider-Man was involved in a plane crash that, even after crashing and him hitting the ground, traveled a significant distance. 
     

&gt;I don’t care to make my own post about it, so take your condescension elsewhere.
    
You really should. If Damian really is that much of a badass someone else would probably do a much better job of explaining why, but since he's not maybe you'll finally see why Damian can't beat a guy who can lift several tons on his own, has precognitive abilities, is able to withstand a ton of punishment, has access to an AI, a multitude of different types of webs including electrifying ones, and is overall just better in every way. Even without the Iron Spider he'd run circles around Damian and beat him thoroughly. 
      
If you're gonna continue to post scans with zero context or explanation as to why the feat is actually impressive then please don't bother. Scaling feats are only impressive when the person you're scaling to is actually explained. Spider-Man beating up several different people with higher tech weaponry than the Batfam use isn't impressive when you know the context. 
     
Iron Man drawing only a drop of blood from Thanos isn't impressive unless you know only one other person in the entirety of the time Thanos spent on screen ever managed to pierce his skin, as well as how strong every other hit that Thanos tanked without any damage was. You need to show why a feat is impressive. 
    
If all your guy can do is compare to Cap and the Winter Soldier though, then your guy is fucked. They're on completely different tiers and Spider-Man toying with the Winter Soldier to Bucky's complete surprise serves to show that. The entirety of Civil War with Cap, WS, and Black Panther serve to show just how powerful these dudes are. Then Spider-Man shows up and toys with the guy who, when using his metal arm, is stronger than the other two. One of those people being someone who can curl a helicopter flying away at great strain.

This way we get DEJHOTL. This is a key for a [Vigenere cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher). Decoded, it gives us ""youtube"", as expected.

Ruined: Peter Quinn's Death  
There was at least an effort by the showrunners to try and fill the void left by Brody. Peter Quinn rose from being a supporting character to a key character. He even had a relationship with Carrie, just like Brody. The message kinda was: we are sorry for taking away your favorite character but here's another good one.  
But then Peter Quinn was also killed off in a brutal manner. He drove a Chevy Suburban through a hail of bullets and died with his head on the wheel. Fans were so angered by the death that a group named #NotOurHomeland wrote a long letter to the showrunner, lamenting about the turn of events, and paid the Hollywood Reporter to publish it.  


Ruined: Nicholas Brody's Death  
  
The decision to kill off one of the two best characters was a misinformed one. Part of what made the first three seasons so great was the presence of the radicalized Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis). His interactions with CIA agent Carrie Mathison were amazing. She was doing her best to bring him down yet she couldn't help but grow emotionally attached to him.  
  
Sadly, in the third season, he was sacrificed to give viewers a shocking death. Shocking indeed as he was hanged from a crane courtesy of a death sentence in Iran.

I really considered it until I realized a few things, as unnecessary extremism not very becoming and no culture is not as risk of it, including veganism.

In the plant based community there are those that are 'veggan'. Thinking about it, I wonder if I would eat eggs if I lived on a farm. We had a kakariki, literally ""small parrot"" In Maori (I assume). He was my best buddy and one of the reasons I went vegan. I hated that he was in a cage, but he would fly into things and knock himself out. He would also poop everywhere. In the morning, he would say, ""Morning, Damian"", which nobody taught him, although mum did teach him a healthy set of swear words and insults. I don't think I'd live up to meeting a small population of chicken's needs. They'd need acres and acres, and then they'd probably just be eaten by foxes. If everything was perfect, being a mutualist, I would probably try and teach them the ways of human wisdom, I'd give them iPads or a computer or something to peck the keys at so they can watch YouTube. If they could tell me I can eat their eggs after I trained them to speak English, if they wanted to learn, I'd probably have the odd one, if I needed to. These philosophical debates, sometimes.

Back down to Earth..

Have you ever tried going plant based for any reasons? It's very difficult to go back.

Gonna have to say you cannot disregard the history made by a lot of these guys. That said, I feel like OP has most likely the best 3 on the list. Curry will go down as the best shooter to exist until someone passes him of course. His 3 championships speak for themselves as he was basically the best player on the court for much of his playoffs. Russell Westbrooks triple double breaking is astounding as are his athletic highlights and the tenacity he exudes. Chris Paul is and will always be remembered as a leader, solid defender for his short size as well as a model of consistency that spread wherever he went regardless of team. His teams always found a way to win.

Honorable mentions are far and few between on this list. Rose and Wall were both insanely good prior to injuries. Kyrie Irving will always be overlooked on his title thanks to LeBron, but personally, I feel like he's always been a top 10 PG every year and in some cases top 5. Thomas had a cool couple of seasons that netted him a scoring title. Lillard has also been amazing but just hasn't found a way to win in playoffs, almost like TMac who put up great numbers but never found playoff success.

But as for who is going to rule the 2020's. That's probably going to go to Doncic and Young. I feel like Fox, LaMelo, Garland and maybe Simmons are going to have amazing contributions as well down the line. I say maybe for Simmons because I just feel like he could probably work better as a starting 4 working at the top of the key, as long as he can develop a jumpshot.

Stopped watching around 2011 and this was really the first time that I watched wrestling again because life. I started watching around the AJ Styles match and would like to comment on a few things and some of my reactions throughout the show:

*Glad to see AJ Styles still have that athleticism in him after all these years. Yawn on Randy, but never really liked him. I love the guy wrestling in his bare feet though.

*Why the fuck is that dude carrying a sword!? Is he rolling with a Braveheart gimick?

*That Damian Priest dude looks like he is bound to be a midcarder his entire career

*Who is that King Nakamura guy!? He looks fun! What show is he in?! 

*Hell Yeah Brood!!!! I was low key hoping that Edge would use the Unprettier to end the match, but this match was really nice for me. I don't know but it reminds me of HBK vs Jericho

*I have no idea what a Becky Lynch is, is she like the Brock Lesnar of the Women's Division? A lot of people seem to like her, charismatic as well. Would like to see more of her, but I hope she doesn't always end her opponents in less than 10 seconds

*Wait what? Dominic? Is this the same kid in the Im Your Papi storyline!? Holy shit wtf!? Meh kinda looks like he doesn't have that same gift as his father when it comes to wrestling

*The Charlotte Flair vs Rhea Ripley vs Nikki ASH was my favorite match of the night. Maybe because it still is really fresh to me, the Divas didn't perform like this back in the day, was really amazed at this match. They are reallyy good!

*Goldberg vs Lashley was the worst match here for me, but yeah Goldberg was really kinda bad at wrestling ever since.

*I was excited for the main event actually, but apparently in the storyline, the Roman Reigns guy said that he will leave WWE if he loses which obviously was a spoiler because it looks like he is the one getting the major push and he obviously isn't losing that belt. He kinda feels bland as well, I don't know this is my first time watching in a decade, but he really feels bland for a person who is supposed to be the torch bearer of the company similar to John Cena. Also, is John Cena bald now!? Holy hell.

Last year was a try out for many players to see who would get minutes not only that year, but also who would be a key piece for this upcoming year (Lee, Mulder, Mannion, Bazemore, Paschall, Payton Jr., Wannamaker, JTA, Poole). Oubre was the free agent, but he had to earn death lineup minutes, a spot he lost for a while (before getting hurt). Also, there's a reason he didn't get resigned. Failed the tryout.

Another day, another revelation, here in the Banana Republic of Great Britain. On 11 August the *Daily Telegraph* [reported](https://archive.is/SFu8R) how the casino-owner Damian Aspinall, having failed to win the government’s support for his plan to buy a South African game reserve, put Carrie Johnson on the payroll of his animal conservation charity.

Also on 11 August, the *Times* [reported](https://archive.is/ZbUPu) that a US biotech company, Illumina, won a £123m contract after David Cameron, a paid adviser there, lobbied Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, to attend a conference attended by Illumina’s chief executive. The contract was awarded a week after the conference, without a tender process.

On 9 August the BBC [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58149765) that in return for relentlessly pestering his former colleagues in government, Cameron earned about $10m – more than most people earn in their lifetimes – from Greensill Capital before its collapse. As prime minister, Cameron had given Lex Greensill access to top ministers and civil servants so Greensill could flog a questionable supply-chain financing scheme.

Those reports came soon after revelations about Ben Elliot’s shenanigans were published in the *Financial Times* and *Sunday Times*. We learned that Elliot, Boris Johnson’s appointee as Conservative Party co-chairman, and a fellow Old Etonian, has been arranging secretive regular meetings with the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and other top ministers for an “advisory board” of donors, some of whom reportedly give £250,000 a year to party coffers. He even promised one, Mohamed Amersi, [influence over the government’s Middle East policies](https://archive.is/GrAZb).

The *FT* also revealed in July that the property sector has given the Conservative Party nearly £18m since Johnson became prime minister two years ago – this at a time when the government is proposing to rip up the country’s restrictive planning laws. And so the litany of distinctly malodorous transactions goes on.

There were all those lucrative pandemic-related contracts that were awarded without any competitive tender process to jewellers, pest controllers, confectionery companies, [Hancock’s former local pub landlord, Dominic Cummings’s mates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/26/matt-hancock-former-neighbour-won-covid-test-kit-contract-after-whatsapp-message) and many more. The government even set up a “VIP lane” for well-connected bidders, and those who used it were [ten times more likely](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-12-09/debates/ED6D1DDB-BCC8-4682-B7FD-DCF0B6B5799C/Covid-19NAOReportOnGovernmentProcurement) to be successful. The government has [repeatedly refused](https://labour.org.uk/press/government-declines-for-a-sixth-time-to-publish-details-of-companies-winning-work-through-its-vip-fast-lane-for-contracts/) to identify them.

There was Robert Jenrick’s approval, as Housing Secretary, of a Tory donor’s £1bn London Docklands development project – just in time for the donor, Richard Desmond, to avoid a £45m levy payable to London’s poorest borough, Tower Hamlets. 

There was Peter Cruddas’s gift of £500,000 to the Conservative Party, less than a week after Johnson had elevated him to the House of Lords, despite objections from the upper chamber’s independent Appointments Commission.

There was the opaque financing by wealthy supporters of Johnson’s Downing Street flat, and of his holiday in Mustique in December 2019 and January 2020. Nor should we forget, although Johnson would very much like us to, [his channelling of £100,000](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50252635) in public money to a firm run by his alleged former lover, Jennifer Arcuri.

All prime ministers and governments reward supporters with jobs, access and peerages. All political parties rely on wealthy donors, be they individuals, lobbying groups or trade unions. But I struggle to remember a prime minister or ruling party that did so as shamelessly, and on such an industrial scale, as Johnson’s Conservatives. 

What they are doing is more than mere sleaze or cronyism – it is borderline corruption. They are giving the ultra-rich access to the very heart of government, prompting the FT to ask: [“Is the UK's democracy for sale?”](https://archive.is/OydvC) And when they’re caught out, they simply shrug, obfuscate, stonewall, profess ignorance, brazen it out or change the subject. What they never do is apologise, resign or express the slightest contrition.

Their conduct is not just deeply inimical to good governance, and corrosive of public confidence in democracy. It is also stunningly hypocritical. 

Johnson and his colleagues won power and secured Brexit by denouncing the [“metropolitan elite”](https://archive.is/yJeJm) and posing as champions of ordinary people. It turns out that they are not champions of ordinary people at all, but of [“access capitalism”](https://archive.is/Em70R), and of a very small and select elite indeed. 

Those “Red Wall” voters who lent Johnson their votes at the last election should ask themselves whose interests the Prime Minister is really concerned about when he takes key decisions on policies and spending. Is it those of blue-collar workers living in Hartlepool, Sunderland and Stoke-on-Trent, or those of the billionaires – many of them foreign-born, tax exiles or non-doms – who furtively bankroll him and his party?

We are never told when and where the mega-rich meet Johnson, Sunak, et al, or what they discuss, or what inside information they receive and what favours they demand in return for their largesse. But it is hard to believe that they are motivated by altruism, or a desire to improve the commonweal, or that issues such as levelling up, state intervention and helping the disadvantaged are at the top of their agenda.

Gonna tag /u/pixels_n_pints as well just because they were involved in the exchange.

Anyways, hey OP. I'm Damian the DM and I run a (5 person) all in person actual play podcast myself, have been for almost 4 years now and have grown the whole way.

I saw the multiple USBs has been addressed. I also saw you mention running multiple Blue Yetis. Don't do it. Not if you care the least not about your audio quality. First of all, you'd be better off with only 1 of its the same room, and I don't recommend that either. 2 of them are probably going to be ever so slightly out of sync, if for no other reason than the different distance they are to the sound source. My own show started with a single Blue Yeti, because it was mostly for the players. When I decided I wanted to be serious about producing a podcast we took a break do we could upgrade to individual set ups. The initial season we recorded and edited with that set up only exists for patrons because we don't want it available to the public checking us out for the first time. The entire 2nd season was scrapped entirely. That is how serious I am about not using the Yeti for an in person actual play.

Bangs did mention the Zoom H6+EXH-6 capsule, and that is a solid set up that carried us on for years and could have continued to do so if we had wanted to keep using it. The key requirement will be that you have a multitrack recording. Even if you can't completely cut something like a cough or side talk, being able to cut it from the most direct mics is a huge difference, and if it's a single track recording you're just stuck with it. This is another nail in the coffin against 1 or 2 Yetis as well. 

Personally, I would recommend against the lav mics for all except maybe the GM, especially if they are wired. A few reasons here. If they are wired, you have to deal with the wires running to the lav packs anyways and you're kinda stuck where the cable goes so you lose most of the benefit of having a lav. There is also the issue of them rubbing on clothes as people move around. And similar to the multitrack reasoning, with a lav they can't really just lean away from the mic, because the mic is coming with them.

So with all that said, I recommend getting dynamic mics. I can't speak to the quality of cheap ones, other than it will probably be better than the Yeti. I started with everyone on the Knox Podcast Mic, which no longer exists, but you can get similar in the Samson Q2U.

Being all in person, and from the post, I'm inferring that everyone will be around the same table. This is gonna suck to hear, but you gotta get the mics off the table or at the least, good shock lints for them. Table bumps, shifts, dice rolls, those all suck to bounce through the mics. You can either get floor stands, which are a bit cumbersome. Or you can do what we did, which was got everyone on their own TV tray next to or slightly away from the main table, with a scissor arm style mic arm and shock mount and everyone keeps their papers, dice, and everything they need on their own table. This allows us to isolate each persons movements in the recording and I just have people be cautious and courteous while they are directly speaking or one of the active members of a scene. I also take a bit of a director's role in asking for retakes when I notice something interrupt the the delivery that might effect the episode. When things happen at the table that aren't picked up well (a table mic is something I want in the future), we also re-narrate back on mic.

As I mentioned, the show has continued to grow as time has carried on and some equipment has come out that wasn't available to us at the time. The H6's older sibling, the H8, is now a thing that has 6 inputs built in (I believe 2 or 4 are XLR only, not the combo Jack's) and is currently less than the H6+EXH-6. I would personally recommend the Podtrak P8 though it's more expensive. It will handle the 6 inputs and (unfortunately) won't grow beyond that (partially fortunate because going beyond 6 people gets *pretty* messy audio wise...). It's more of a traditional board which I find easier to work with than the HX lines knobs and tiny screen. I do not use it, but I have the Livetrak L-12 which is very similar, but less podcast focused. I probably would have done the P8 if it existed at the time.

Mic wise, while I think a cheap dynamic will get you started, eventually this will be your main upgrade. I am personally now using the Zoom ZDM-1, and it is amazing for off axis rejection in my all in person set up. I've got some images in my [latest newsletter](https://www.adventuresinerylia.com/podcast-blog/2021/7/31/pieces-falling-into-place-erylian-extra-july-2021-edition) that showcase the difference between them and the Blue enCore 100s we used before.

I think that covers most of the basics of my experience growing in this sort of set up.

I'd argue that Gia and Damian's relationship has been the most toxic on the show. Between Gia being too strong willed and at least framed to be drama-hungry and Damian being unable to acknowledge fault, their relationship was set up to fail. I was actually upset to hear in the first ep back that they were still seeing each other because I felt like it might have inhibited growth on both of their parts. 

Add in Francesca, and I knew that this was just going to be disastrous, but I'm low key glad it happened because it seems to have pushed Gia out of clinging to a relationship that was not healthy. I think Damian would have been fine just stringing her along and dating around until he found someone he was content with.

I somewhat feel bad for Francesca, but not for a relationship - I just feel bad that she decided this was the best way to continue her reality TV career. I don't think she was actually interested in dating Damian. I don't think she was interested in inserting herself in the middle of someone's dating relationship. She knew there would be drama, but not that kind of drama. Damian wasn't up front with where his relationship stood with Gia when he invited Francesca and that much was clear.

All in all, I think they all suck. Gia needs to learn to control her temper and emotions. Damian needs to accept that sometimes *he* is the one at fault or even partially at fault. And Francesca needs to either pick better reality shows to bomb (if she's just trying to stay relevant). Or if her intentions are to just make friends who understand the world after being on a reality program, she needs to be more mindful of who she chooses to hang out with and their relationship status.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1628882762.0,,False,0.0,{},h8tjaga,False,t3_ow1roy,False,t1_h8tjaga,False,t3_ow1roy,/r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix/comments/ow1roy/thoughts_on_the_whole_damienfrancescagiannina/h8tjaga/,1651689812.0,12.0,False,True,False,LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,t5_2e7kr5,r/LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First of all, until science progresses enough this answer will remain, as a whole, purely subjective though there will be objective facts used as I walk the same path as Thomas the Skeptic, And the whole shall be presented as fact for the easement of reading it. For example this answer, in all technicality, is supported by current quantum physics, but we have no tangible proof of God lol. Note: since this is a comment there will be no bibliography, but I will instead recommend ‘High Magick’ by Damian Echols as this paraphrases a lot of his work 

So, I’ve spent most of my life studying western religions with more recent study in Buddhism, ceremonial magick, and personal psychedelic usage leading to a ‘click’ where suddenly it all just made sense. As I am sure you know the light from of stars comes from the nuclear fusion taking place at their core, and it is the same fusion that created most of the elements we find in the known universe. Due to our quantum entanglement with these celestial bodies it would appear that we are capable of drawing energy from them. Throughout most of history, the teachings for harnessing and applying these energies have been passed down from master to student in a mostly esoteric manner. for example when Adam first names the creatures in Eden it is a description of the first cultures naming the constellations(Ram, Bull, fish, etc.) and learning to invoke their energies. Noah and the arc is really just a story of preservation of the of these ancient teachings through A particularly turbulent time in the known world. Moses crossing the desert with the ark of the covenant is about carrying these teachings forward into the next stage Taurus to Aries polytheism to monotheism. There is a presence that guides the evolution of humanity, and it appears to lead us towards eventual union with itself, which can only be fully perceived and understood through direct experience. Like many here, I have experienced messengers who directed me closer to this divine presence. These messengers have been known as the ‘gods and their children,’ ‘archangels and angels,’ or more familiar to this community the ‘intelligent extra dimensional entities and their machine elves.’ It is a well recorded phenomenon that every age or so (give or take a few hundred years) humanity is provided with a new disposition that is to say a new way of worshiping and interacting with the Prime Mover, God if you will. This is essentially a new formula for enlightenment/ union with the divine source of all creation. The new DOES NOT negate the old, but rather builds on it. This seems to be what Christ meant in Matthew 5:17 when he announces that he didn’t come to do away with the law but to fulfill it. Old Magicks remain effective, but the new formula is meant to broaden our understanding of the Prime Mover, and enhance our relationship to it. 
Okay so that brings us to the zodiac. In the age of Taurus polytheism was the mainline formula. Great visual example: the highest god in the Sumerian pantheon of the time was Anu who was referred to as the ‘Bull of heaven.’ Next we had Aries, the Ram. Bringing Judaism and the rise of monotheism. Rams horns remain significant implements in Jewish rituals. This is why Moses got so pissed about coming down from Mt. Sinai to find the Hebrews worshiping a golden calf one of the primary symbols of the past age. Judaism is a moon-based system, and Moses was a little more than a new version of the ancient Samarian god of the moon, Sin. Note that Moses received the new law on Mt. Sinai, and Jews hold worship in a synagogue. Then came Pisces, which cemented monotheism in the form of Christianity and Islam. People no longer used the term gods but angels. Christianity specifically is a solar religion with Jesus being the embodiment of the sun and his 12 disciples the constellations of the zodiac. These old magicks Can still be used effectively in Aquarius granted you use the key of the zodiac to understand them. Without the zodiac it is a little more than the superstitions taught in common churches built for suppression and control. Gods, deities, stars, angels, machine elves, doesn’t matter these are the intelligences behind the symbols of the stars no matter what you choose to call them. These labels are merely the lens of different cultures, But what matters is the power that lies behind those labels. Each stage of practice that we have been through thus far represents one of the spheres on the middle pillar of the tree of life. Polytheism of Taurus being the sphere of the kingdom, the lunar monotheism of Judaism in Aries bringing us to the sphere of foundation, christ or Hahnemann introduced the eon of Pisces in which we traded a lunar-based formula for solar and entered the sphere of harmony. Finally, this brings us to the current age of Aquarius raising us to the hidden sphere of knowledge a notably Saturnian time of judgment. In this age we have the tools of science, psychedelics, and the ability to decode all of the religious bullshit so that we may practice true magick in the raw. The next Sphere is that of the crown the gate for the species to the empyrean/the mind of God. We have the knowledge, we have the tools, what will we do?

If you start trying to squat and throw yourself into a three it’s just gonna turn into a ‘fling’ rather than a shot. This is the way I increased my range to 3 and deeper, I was taught this by a shooting coach, but if you want evidence that isn’t just some random guy on Reddit saying it, Damian Lillard talked about it on the knuckleheads podcast which I can link for you. I’ll explain the whole thing in depth and also throw a TL;DR that just tells you what to do. 

So like I said you don’t want to squat down super deep and explosively jump into a shot. It just makes the shot too jerky and awkward and you lose control. I’m guessing there isn’t much difference in terms of your feel when you shoot a 9 foot vs a 12 foot vs a 15 foot jumper right? So if the three point line is only 3 extra feet behind the 15 foot mark, which you can make, then somewhere in there you are going from a point where you can comfortably shoot to where you can’t. So how do you generate more power for your shot without bending lower and exploding harder on your jump? Well you have to learn to use your legs more efficiently and time the upward motion of your shot better so the leg power transfers. 

This is where the actual drill comes in. Literally all you have to do is do normal form shooting (Lillard calls it ‘foundation shooting’ but it’s the same thing). Start right in front of the basket and shoot a shot using your form.

Some key things: 
1) Really focus on flicking the shot with your wrist and getting good arc on it, even if you’re close. You don’t have to sky it into the basket but really the goal is to develop touch with your hand to be able to shoot the ball in a shooting arc that can work anywhere on the floor with more control. 
2) Don’t short arm the shot at all, full extend and follow through every time. 
3) Do not jump. This doesn’t mean keep your legs straight but just don’t come off the ground. 

Keep moving backwards again doing the same form every time. I’d normally say make at least 2 in a row before you move back, but when I do it I try to make like 5-6 if not more in a row. Eventually you will reach a point behind the foul line that you can’t comfortably make the shot. At this point you wanna start moving forward, and then backwards again. Basically, you will slowly extend your range. I can tell you from experience, what will eventually happen is that you can kinda have that feel for the ball so you can just flick the ball with great control and touch from anywhere. You won’t be truly wet from three until you can shoot a shot with no jump fairly consistently. Then once you add the jump back in it becomes absolutely effortless. Shooting a 10 footer and a 20 footer feels no different. 

That’s how I did it and it’s how I was taught, but like I said other people can testify to it. This is really all you have to do to get about 90% of the way to being good enough at shooting to light up pickup games and intramurals and stuff.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1628481691.0,,False,0.0,{},h88z10q,False,t3_p0djbx,False,t1_h88z10q,False,t1_h86sr4f,/r/BasketballTips/comments/p0djbx/i_have_a_shooting_problem_i_can_shoot_7080_on/h88z10q/,1652375348.0,6.0,False,True,False,BasketballTips,t5_2tt6s,r/BasketballTips,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm a huge fan of the character - every issue since 2011, bagged and boarded, plus the Morrison run in '09. Jason Todd is my favorite Robin.And he's never won a straight fight between him and a few key members of the Bat Family. But because there's more to liking a character than just ""He's so badass, I love him"" we'll break it down.

He's bound and gagged Dick and Damian when he was trying to be a supervillain, but Dick whipped him when he got free. Not only that, but they'd mentioned that this had happened multiple times before then.

He DID beat the crap out of Tim in BftC, so that I'll agree to. But he's never ""beaten the shit"" out of Damian, because Damian got all of his training and more since he was old enough to hold his head up straight. 

In fact. Damian broke into his hideout, stole his helmet, and beat the shit out of HIM in Tomasi's Batman and Robin.

He JUST got his ass handed to him by Bruce back in RHatO #25 (maybe #26?, idk)

I didn't say he wasn't a good fighter, I said he wasn't as good as the rest of the Bat Family. Which is a point backed up by pretty much every fight with him in modern readings.

The chemistry and fit between Steph and Draymond was absolutely insane. Draymond has very good vision and passing skills for a power forward, and his passing from the top of the key was instrumental to the warriors offense. People might say “okay but he needs those all time great elite shooters to be effective”, but if it was so easy why aren’t all the other power forwards in the league doing what Draymond does? It’s not an easy skill at all no matter how many elite shooters you have on your team. Draymond being able to do that at his size is invaluable to the warriors offense. I do admit that **current draymond** is nowhere near as good offensively as he was before because his own decline in shooting and scoring is taking a lot away from his playmaking impact.

And then defensively Draymond is a game changer. Gives the ability to run small ball 5, can switch on all positions, and he’s the defensive quarterback getting the rest of the team in position. Klay himself is an elite on-ball defender but his off-ball defense is nothing special and honestly very lazy at times. Draymond’s impact on defense is on a whole other scale.

The league has also fought alongside Darkseid, are you gonna say that he’s redeemed too?

As for the batman thing, it depends whose writing him, because people like Tom king make him a self insert and write him super out of character, but even then, he hasn’t done things bad enough to make him a villain. A little morally spotty, sure, and no, I wouldn’t call him a badass because a lot of time he’s doing the wrong things.

That being said…

Barbara getting pregnant isn’t continuity, and if you’re counting stuff alternative universe Batman has done, you might as well count the blatantly evil ones too. 

I don’t know what you mean with Alfred, but I’m assuming you mean in the Tom King run, and that was after bane kidnapped Alfred, and although Bruce sending damian was wrong, how would he know that would’ve happened? It was a hostage situation. Also, Alfred is actively involved in Batman’s line of work. He knows the risk.

His fiancé? You mean Selina? When did this come up?

Steph started the gang war herself and got captured herself. It’s not like Bruce planned to get her captured.

He made those plans as a last ditch situation in case they got brainwashed or turned. It was also implied to be made back when the league started and Bruce didn’t trust them that much. Even then, you can’t blame him for just *having* those plans. The league members told him their weaknesses, and he wrote it down and kept it under lock and key.

Record: 14W - 1 Void - 4L   **+6.90 units**

This is what we picked next:

Radomiak Radom topped the second tier of the Polish league pyramid last season and secured a ticket for Ekstrkaklasa. Their schedule is pretty tough at the beginning of the campaign, but the hosts already picked up a point from Poznan. Dariusz Banasik’s side held Lech to a goalless draw and boosted its confidence. Damian Jakubik and the lads have been pretty confident at the home ground last season, while their defense was the best in Division 1. Radomiak Radom had a very promising pre-season, as they lost only once in six friendlies. The home side also managed to beat Jagiellonia and Lechia in prep matches. This time, a challenging task is ahead of them, and Radomiak wants to put another good display.

Legia opened its domestic campaign with a narrow 1:0 victory over Wisla Plock. The defending champions are in the middle of the Champions League quals, and they head to this game after a clash in Tallinn. Czeslaw Michniewicz’s side eliminated the Estonian side Flora thanks to a 3:1 aggregate win. However, a key tie is ahead of them, as Legia goes to Zagreb to meed Dinamo on Wednesday. The visitors will be focused on that game, and we expect to see a mixed lineup here. Some of the backup and rotation players might get a chance to make an appearance in this clash. Legia was involved in many tight away matches last season, conceding only five times on the road. We don’t expect to see many goals in this neither, and the game should remain under a 2.5 margin. It wouldn’t surprise us if the hosts also remain undefeated here.

Gianina had her pride wounded by being left at the alter so she’s obsessed with trying to make it work with a guy who already expressed disdain for key elements of her personality.

-

Monday June 28 was a gruelling day for Boris Johnson. Days earlier, health secretary Matt Hancock had resigned for breaking coronavirus restrictions during an affair with an aide, and the political aftershocks were still reverberating. Instead of recuperating in his recently redecorated Downing Street flat with his wife Carrie that evening, the prime minister was driven to a Kensington townhouse for a discreet gathering with some of the wealthiest people in London.

Among those milling in the garden over drinks and canapés were key donors to the Conservative party, including host Rishi Khosla, a banker. Peter Cruddas, the online trading tycoon who gave the Tories £500,000 days after being elevated by Johnson to the House of Lords in 2020, was there, as was Howard Shore, the founder of Shore Capital who gave the party £250,000 this year.

These were some of the money men who had supported Johnson’s rise to power. Many were also members of the secretive “Advisory Board,” a hitherto unknown group of elite donors who enjoy frequent and direct access to the most powerful people in government.

Although Johnson was warmly received, those present say the donors boxed the prime minister’s ears over the troubles in his cabinet as well as the economic direction of the country under his leadership. “They’re fed up with all this state intervention,” one party insider with knowledge of the discussion says. “The top donors are Thatcherite free marketeers, and they have no qualms about giving Boris a piece of their mind.” 

Johnson, as is often his way, told them what they wanted to hear: that he hadn’t forgotten his closest supporters. And before he left for the night he vowed to press ahead with “freedom day” — the controversial lifting of most of England’s Covid-19 restrictions on July 19.

The evening was not organised by Johnson. It was convened by an adept high-society operator installed by the prime minister to ensure the Tory party was bankrolled at the last election, is flush today and will be well into the future: Ben Elliot.

Elliot, who once described himself as a “willing slave to the stars”, is best known for running Quintessentially, a “concierge” company that famously caters to the whims of the wealthy, from shipping a dozen albino peacocks to a party for Jennifer Lopez to airlifting elm tea bags to Madonna. The 45-year-old Etonian and son-in-law of rock star Steve Winwood told the FT in 2011 that securing services for his wealthy clients was all about “knowing the right people to contact for the right favour”.

Under Elliot the Advisory Board has become the most desirable club in the Tory party, its members granted monthly access to Johnson or chancellor Rishi Sunak, according to people briefed on its activities. Conservative officials say it was set up before Johnson took power, but decline to say when. It does not officially exist on any party literature. One senior minister in David Cameron’s administration says: “I’ve never heard of it.”

Since July 2019, when Johnson appointed Elliot the Conservative party’s co-chair, the impeccably connected nephew of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has been at the centre of the operation to provide the cash to keep the Conservatives — the western world’s most successful political party — in office. According to Tory officials, Elliot is also Johnson’s counsellor, offering advice to the financially challenged prime minister. They meet regularly, duelling on the tennis or squash court.

Where Johnson, notoriously tight but always short of cash, has a tortured relationship with money, Elliot revels in connections with the wealthy. While Johnson’s personal finances have grabbed the headlines, his friend Elliot has quietly transformed the party’s money culture, bringing aspects of Quintessentially’s model, so that ever-larger cash donations bring ever-greater access to the heart of government. It is a model that will be crucial to Johnson’s ongoing political success. As the prime minister eyes the next election, which must be held by 2024, he needs Elliot to keep delivering.

-

*One of Johnson’s first appointments* after becoming prime minister in July 2019 was to bring in Elliot as the Conservative party’s money man. The Tory fundraising operation had atrophied over the three previous years of Theresa May’s leadership, and preparations had to be made for a “Get Brexit Done” election, which ultimately took place in December 2019. In the first two weeks of that campaign the Tories raised a record £8.6m.

Elliot is 12 years Johnson’s junior, but they have long moved in the same social circle. In the early 2000s, Elliot regularly played poker with Ben and Zac Goldsmith, wealthy environmentalists, at Crown London Aspinalls, a private gaming club in Mayfair. Johnson, who made the transition from freewheeling political columnist and commentator to Tory MP at about the same time, was also part of the black-tie Aspinall clique, according to one member of the set. Elliot says he never played poker with the future prime minister.

Damian Aspinall, son of the club’s founder, runs an animal conservation charity that recently hired Johnson’s wife Carrie as head of communications. The Goldsmith brothers’ father, James, was a Eurosceptic financier. Risk-taking, Eton and Brexit bound the group together. “They are fiercely loyal to each other. They always look after each other,” says a person with knowledge of the parties.

Elliot first demonstrated his usefulness to ambitious Tory politicians in 2016 when he acted as treasurer for Zac Goldsmith’s unsuccessful London mayoral campaign. (Goldsmith is now an environment minister.) “Boris was so taken with how rich [Elliot] is and just how many rich people he knows,” a friend of the prime minister says.

Elliot was known by his professional colleagues as “Mr Access All Areas” for his networking and favour-winning work at Quintessentially. Last year, a publicist from Chicago told the FT she was offered three tiers of Quintessentially membership starting at $8,500 a year up to $40,000 for “Quintessence” — a 13-month invite-only subscription that included dinner at Buckingham Palace, VIP packages to the Sundance and Cannes film festivals and a tennis tournament with Richard Branson on his private Caribbean island.

Elliot appears to have been deploying a similar model in the political arena since his elevation two years ago, offering access to Johnson in the place of luxury recreation. Described as effortlessly charming, Elliot will, for example, pitch potential donors in a “mockney” accent, adopting working-class patois, before following up with a steely approach. “He’s very forceful,” says one Conservative HQ insider, adding that he can be brusque with donors and Tory staff alike. “Ben squeezes the pips from the donors. His follow-ups for money are blunt, along the lines of ‘You owe us the money, you promised us the money.’ He’s like a bailiff.”

Johnson, by contrast, is widely seen by senior Tories as useless at raising money. Although his father Stanley worked for the European Commission and World Bank, the family’s finances were chaotic. Johnson went to Eton College on a scholarship. “He was surrounded by really rich people, when his family was relatively poor,” says one former colleague, who describes how the dynamic played out during the lavish Black and White Ball Tory fundraiser in February 2020. “He was meant to take to the stage with Ben Elliot to auction off tennis with them both.” But the prime minister baulked, saying “I’ll do the tennis but I won’t do the auction”. The source says Johnson “detests” asking for cash and is delighted to leave the fundraising work to Elliot.

Which has given Elliot great influence over the party’s finances. Conservative officials from the David Cameron era admit that he has been better than them at raising money, but one says: “We were a bit more cautious about who we took money from.”

Elliot’s supporters deny this characterisation. Lord Leigh, a Tory treasurer, says, “Ben Elliot is doing a fantastic job. His hard work is a bedrock of success for the party and he is scrupulous and exacting in everything he does.”

Friends say he is modernising the party, including opening a new Tory campaign office in Leeds and that he has excelled at bringing in more money from existing donors, rather than bringing in a raft of new ones. A Conservative spokesman said the party’s donations were declared with the Electoral Commission and that fundraising was “a legitimate part of the democratic process”.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1627660442.0,,1627663346.0,0.0,{},h73gdq9,True,t3_oun9r0,False,t1_h73gdq9,False,t3_oun9r0,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oun9r0/inside_boris_johnsons_money_network_long_read/h73gdq9/,1652462889.0,25.0,False,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Elliot may have filled his party’s coffers, he has learnt the dangers of getting too close to the prime minister’s ramshackle personal finances. Downing St insiders say it is commonplace to hear the prime minister, a recently divorced and remarried father of six, complain about his money problems. “Occasionally you’d hear him say, ‘I just can’t afford to do this job,’” says one. “He needs a very high figure, just to get by.”

And I completely agree about the issue of two raw prospects that pretty much need to be force fed minutes to figure out their game. But, if the FO can plan the rest of their roster accordingly, it becomes less of an issue (and even frees up J or Kuminga to go get heavy minutes in Santa Cruz for a bit). Like, I'd gladly upgrade Samilagic's ""project spot"" to Kuminga, and Mulder/Paschall to a couple vet mins. If they also get someone like Batum/Mills/Gay on the MLE, it becomes even more of a no brainer for me.

Even when the Warriors were in the finals, they always had a handful of G-League level players on the roster, who were probably worse than either Kuminga or Wiseman (Damian Jones, Jordan Bell, Patrick McCaw, Quinn Cook, old man Jonas Jerebko, Alfonzo McKinnie, etc.). That was easily hidden come the playoffs, because having a core of Steph/KD/Klay/Dray is fucking ridiculous, but still, don't think it's awful to have 2/15 roster spots dedicated to projects if you're sure you'll have 10-13 rotational pieces. Especially when they're players with such crazy high upside as Wiseman/Kuminga, and when you now have an actually good developmental staff in place. Even if they ain't here longterm, those two could be key pieces in an eventual trade, and they seem like they'd be fairly appealing assets to a rebuilding team.

I'd rather trade down a couple of spots with a team like the Kings, especially since we'd still be able to get one of Moody/Wagner/Mitchell/Giddey, but I ain't opposed to the idea of Kuminga.

Should he become available, he’s at the top of the offseason wishlist.

&gt;The Warriors’ trio of stars — Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson — have made it clear to management they want the franchise to focus on the pursuit of a championship, even to consider using their two lottery picks to get someone who can help immediately, sources confirmed. Warriors general manager Bob Myers said their goal this offseason is to add more of a veteran presence.

&gt;Should the Warriors go that route, Beal, the Washington Wizards’ guard who made third-team All-NBA, is deemed to be the best player and best fit for the Warriors among the players who could potentially be available this offseason.

&gt;Of course, “available” is the operative word. Beal to this point, publicly, has held firm in his stance he would not request a trade from the Wizards. He has two years left on his deal worth $71.8 million, including a $37.3 million player option for 2022-23. So Washington really only has team control for one more season and, after hiring Wes Unseld Jr. as their new head coach, might be ripe for a slower rebuild.

&gt;Beal attended Team USA camp in Las Vegas along with Green and Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who is an assistant coach for the Olympic men’s basketball team. Beal did not travel to Tokyo after being placed in health and safety protocols.

&gt;Blazers guard Damian Lillard, who has been rumored to be unhappy with Portland and a threat to demand a trade, was another desired player if he were to become available. But Lillard has clarified he has not demanded a trade and multiple sources said the Warriors don’t suspect Lillard would want to come to the Bay.

&gt;The interest in Beal (and Lillard) underscores the prioritizing of another reliable offensive creator. Golden State had the 20th-ranked offense even with Curry averaging a career-high 32 points on 48.2 percent shooting.

&gt;Beal, who finished runner up to Curry for the scoring title, would significantly bolster the talent and explosiveness on the roster. He’s a preferred target over the Raptors’ Pascal Siakam, who has been a rumored option for Golden State. Beal would give the Warriors shooting and another offensive creator — two elements they need badly to take the pressure off Curry. One of the best scorers in the league, Beal can also carry the team should Curry have to miss some time.

&gt;At 6-foot-3 and reputed as a subpar defender, Beal doesn’t fit the Warriors’ typical mold for an NBA off guard. But his strength and physicality create some hope Beal could contribute on defense if he bought in on that end of the floor. Undoubtedly, some of the optimism comes from the strides Andrew Wiggins made in a defense anchored by Green.

&gt;Beal could only be acquired through a trade, which was expected by many during the trade deadline earlier this year. But Beal reiterated his intentions to stay with Washington, and the Wizards rallied to make the playoffs as the No. 8 seed, losing in the first round to Philadelphia in five games.

&gt;If Beal to the Warriors is even possible, it would likely have to happen before next week’s draft. The Warriors’ No. 7 and No. 14 picks would almost assuredly be included in a package for Beal. Golden State would likely have to add a future pick as well. The clear preference for the Warriors’ veterans — Curry is 33 years old, Green and Thompson are both 31— is to go all-in for these next few years instead of restocking the regular roster with players who could take years to develop.

&gt;Any deal involving Beal would have to include Andrew Wiggins to make the salaries match. Wiggins has two years, $65.2 million remaining on his contract. One team source did say the Warriors wouldn’t be quite willing to gut the roster to acquire Beal. If they could land Beal while keeping James Wiseman, it could be the best of both worlds for the Warriors — appease the desire to win now while retaining a future centerpiece. But Washington figures to want Wiseman.

&gt;The Warriors are expecting to get Thompson back after two years missed due to injuries. But after sustaining a torn right ACL in 2019 and a torn left Achilles in 2020, it is unknown at what level Thompson will be when he returns. Kevin Durant’s ability to play at a high level coming off an Achilles injury allows for some confidence in Thompson’s return, but just his presence would be much-needed help for Curry, who put up an MVP-caliber season on a team with inexperienced players in key positions.

&gt;Golden State went 2-7 in the nine games Curry missed, which landed them in the play-in tournament where they were eliminated by the Memphis Grizzlies. The Warriors had a .587 win percentage in games Curry played. A .583 win percentage was good for a three-way tie for the No. 5 seed in the West.

&gt;Barring a seemingly improbable trade for a star, the Warriors’ options are to use the picks and hope to land a player who can be a contributor by season’s end, then use free agency to fill gaps with veteran talent. The Warriors have the taxpayer mid-level exception and veteran minimum exceptions to use. They also have the option of finding a sign-and-trade partner for Kelly Oubre Jr., a free agent who isn’t expected to return to the Warriors.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1627002824.0,,False,0.0,{},h672iuu,False,t3_opreuf,False,t1_h672iuu,True,t3_opreuf,/r/nba/comments/opreuf/the_athletic_the_golden_state_warriors_are/h672iuu/,1652531268.0,3.0,False,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither Jason nor Gal belong to the Caucasian ethnicity group.

Jason Momoa did a whole interview about being not white and the first big mixed superhero. Regé-Jean Page is as ""white"" as Jason.

&gt;Believe it or not, people of every color are born and live everywhere.

Indeed they are.

Like black people in Kansas, say? Or even on fictional alien worlds?

&gt;Clark Kent was written by white-Jewish immigrants.

Jewish yes. Caucasian, no. Jews are their own ethnic group. To be an allegory of a Middle Eastern religious figure (Moses).

You keep saying white, but I imagine someone of African ethnicity with albinism would also be unsuitable to you?

&gt;You're trying to pull focus away from the visual aspect of a visual medium.

Adaptation. Superman is two dimensional as he exists on the printed page. Im okay with him gaining an extra dimension. If I can accept Batman murdering I can accept Superman not being white.

&gt;I'm not making any assumptions. I asked a question. Answer it, or deflect. Those are your options. I think that you answered it already by not answering it.

You asked a question based on an assumption, that I'm somehow ""woke"" or trying to erase specifically white characters.

I actually think my standard is pretty simple. Some characters are formulated from inception to represent certain things. Those things should be protected or you'll lose the heart of the character. Some characters don't have that intent.

So Damian Wayne? Yeah whatever ethnicity, change him from Middle Eastern. Duke Thomas? Yeah whatever, doesn't need to be black. Selina Kyle? Yeah whatever, doesn't need to be white. Harvey Dent? Yeah whatever. Etc....

And some have race as part of what the character is. 

So Thor? Nah, he's intended to represent the Scandinavian religion and people of 1000 years ago. Heimdall: see before. T'Challa : Made to support the American Civil Rights Movement of the 60's and the struggle of blacks in America. Bruce Wayne: Made to represent ""old money"" of America. Hal Jordan: key storyline of the GL/GA run was about his whiteness. Etc....

Bonus: Prof X and Magneto: I think it would be fitting to have them played by black actors given their real life inspiration.

The ""issue"" for most characters that are non-white is they are usually created because there are few non-white characters. So they usually have a from inception reason behind it.

I've yet to encounter a sound argument as to why Superman is the latter over the former. If you said you prefer visual fidelity, that's a sound argument and completely consistent.

But you don't prefer fidelity when ""white enough"" ethnicities portray characters. That's where your double standard lies. Because I think only the Donner Superman films and Raimi Spider-Man films had universal (or nearly) visual fidelity.

**Who to keep for sure:**

* Damian Lillard. Do I really have to say it?
* Norman Powell. He's a long, fast shooting guard with decent perimeter defense that can slash and shoot. He's a great 2-guard to put next to Lillard.
* Carmelo Anthony. The dude has been here 2 years already and is just too valuable to let go. He isn't a good defender but he's Chauncey's pal and a veteran shooter that garners respect.
* Robert Covington. Great defender with a 3-ball and size? Absolutely essential to keep this man, especially on his incredible contract.
* Anfernee Simons. He's not quite a backup point guard, but definitely can come off the bench at the 2 spot and do some damage.
* Nassir Little. Full of potential, just waiting to break out and be a regular presence at the 3 spot! Don't trade this man for sure.
* Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Why not? He could come on cheap and develop further into the role he dipped his toes into this season.

**Who to consider trading/parting with:**

* Jusuf Nurkic. Nurkic plays with a ton of heart though he tends to get hurt often and gets exposed against the best (Jokic) centers in the league. He is still capable of being an All-star outsider, but he's gotta stay healthy and make that three point development worth something.
* Enes Kanter. Dude can rebound like a god but he might need to go if Nurkic stays around. He's just so offense-focused in a system dying for defensive presence. He could be a cheap glass cleaner off the bench like he is now, but that requires another player at the same position to pick up the defensive slack.
* Harry Giles III. There were flashes in which I thought Giles would suddenly become That Dude. But he just can't seem to put it all together all the time. Maybe on another minimum he'd have a better shot, who knows.
* Derrick Jones Jr. He's a big athlete with hidden super hops that can shoot the ball surprisingly well. He's built like a great defender should be, but doesn't have the skills to put it all together yet. Might be a nice trade piece, or could provide value off the bench.

**Who to trade/part ways with:**

* C.J. McCollum. This kinda sucks because I like CJ so much, but it's clear that he provides a role too similar to Lillard and ought to share his talents on another roster. With Norm getting his bag and ideally getting tossed into the 2 spot, McCollum may very well be the trading piece necessary to shake the roster up.
* Zach Collins. I'm sorry, the dude just gets hurt too much. I'd like to try and get some trade value for him, but a championship-eyeing team can't compete when key elements of their roster are on the injury report. Surely some team would be willing to swap some things around...

**Who to consider bringing in:**

* (Point depth) George Hill, Delon Wright, ​Cory Joseph. All three of these are veteran options to run the second unit at the point. Each one of them can defend to some degree, playmake, and shoot the ball, which is exactly the type of thing that needs to come behind Lillard.
* (Wing depth) Kent Bazemore, Justise Winslow. Bazemore might be a familiar face, but offers the exact type of thing you'd want coming off the bench. Winslow might not be a shooter, but he can perform the ""large playmaker"" role that acts as a secondary facilitator on the floor. Might be worth a try for either of these two at the right price point.
* (Wing star) DeMar DeRozan, Khris Middleton, Tobias Harris. These guys would require some real GM wizardry to acquire. Lillard really does need a key wing presence if he wants to go deep in the playoffs, and these are the three best on the market now. DeRozan can slash, shoot the middy, pass, and make athletic plays, but his 3 point history may turn the team's attention away. Khris Middleton just got the Bucks to the Finals, so even if he's near CJ McCollum's value I can't imagine it would be easy to pry an occasional All-Star with a shot, defense, and a great all-round game. Harris is also coming off a great season and might be in Philly's future plans, but he would be a size-up over CJ and slot in well on the wing as a key offensive presence.
* (Post depth) Hassan Whiteside, Drew Eubanks, Dwight Powell. Hassan isn't the brightest of philosophers, but that doesn't stop him from being an All-defensive caliber player. He's a great defensive player in the post and could definitely come off the bench again for the right price (and with the right training). Eubanks is someone I'd also consider acquiring if we let go of Kanter or Collins since he can provide Kanter's type of impact for cheap. Maybe not a first option, but I'd pair him with a defensive center for sure. Finally, Dwight Powell is a great all-round center that would fit well on this type of team, but might also be valued by the Mavs in the same way. It would take some negotiations with Mark to pry Powell off their hands, but I'd kill for a roster with two Powells on it at the same time.
* (Post star) Myles Turner, Bobby Portis, Nerlens Noel. Each one of these dudes isn't necessarily an all-star yet, but I would let any of them take the starting C spot if an offensive C is maintained. Turner can shoot and defend at a high level as a big man and might just be feasible to acquire, but Indiana would probably want some draft compensation in an arrangement like that. Portis is finishing an excellent season in Milwaukee and is probably due for a payday in the near future, so this would be a perfect opportunity to step in and try to weave him in to the starting 5 spot. Nerlens Noel could also be an option similar to Portis that might respond to an offer to take over the full-time C, but with a higher ceiling due to age.

In his line of work he couldn’t be. It’s a job requirement to say SOMETHING. A former four term congressman and party leader, the California native was always the center of attention in every room he entered. He could sell water to a goldfish his brother always said. A cliche to be sure but in some ways It was true too, Mason had a Silver tongue since before he had his iconic silver hair. For the first time though Mason sat silent in his bewilderment. His subordinate and legal advisor Garth Wagner broke up the silence “great thank you professor just wanted to get that right in the notes. Ummm….Gretchen maybe the three of us can talk outside yeah?”

After clearing the room the trio of politicos stood in the sleek modern hallway outside the professors office. Garth again led the conversation breaking the awkward tension brought about by Mason’s conspicuous silence. “So Gretchen you heard him right? Homeless Smelters….I mean Gretchen we’re Democrats” Mason irate broke his cellphone with just a grip. He found the fire he couldn’t seem to muster on the candidates leather couch.  “DEMOCRATS! Where setting the bar at just HUMAN! I don’t know anyone on either side who would….What kind of ass backwards place is this! This is a tenured professor of economics who thinks we should be Smelting homeless people and that the state of California, MY STATE; needs to be a federal Wildfire preserve?! Not for animals but for
LITERAL.

Gretchen Troy listened quietly and after the much larger man had finished his piece spoke up “so you don’t think we should run him? Mr. James look at these polling numbers…” Mason punched the wall turning a deep color as the blood rushed to his head “RUN HIM?! We need to commit him. Lock the door and throw away the key. NO I don’t care what those numbers say. You said that my “California candidates” can’t win but so far in Madison I’ve seen a nutty professor and a bright operative willing to sink her own career for him for what I can only PRAY are personal reasons. I can’t predict the future but with 100% certainty  Dr. Henry Faust will not be elected President of these United States. Now I have a plane to catch.” As Mason James stormed off Garth and Gretchen stood by the door. After a moment of reflective quiet Garth sighs, “What does the polling say…” he lifted  a hand before Gretchen could speak “I am not sold and what I heard is…a lot to take in…but for my own sanity I need to ask what does the polling say” Gretchen is again interrupted when two men emerged from the shadows “Mr. Wagner” Faust called out with his smooth voice and deviant but confident smile “I’m going to be the President. It’s a done deal as far as I’m concerned, now if you want to join us then please come in”

Part 2: Election night 2026

It’s election night and former DNC chairman Mason James paces drunkenly in his study. Transfixed on his television screen and Twitter feed. The room is drab and dark as only the street lights and his small television set provide any light. with his boxes of mementos  packed to the ceiling. He was surprised he was even selected for the relocation. He had Gretchen figured as the vindictive type. With a bottle of tequila in his hand and a unkempt two month beard on his face he sat down to the news;

“Good evening California, I am Lilith Priestly and your watching channel 6 news nationwide. Our coverage of election night is drawing to a quick close as we can now confirm that Wisconsin Native and Dean of Economics from the University of Wisconsin Madison Dr. Henry Faust has been elected President of the United States winning 48 of 50 states aside from his GOP opponent Senator Elenor Welles’ native New Hampshire and the state of California where his harshest intra-party critic former congressman and former DNC chairmen Mason James resides.”

The devilish smile on screen sends a chill down Mason’s spine. How did we get here. How was he alone in that feeling of dread when Henry smiles. The sole politician who won’t  pretend that the unhinged rhetoric was anything less than criminal. Look where it got him. The news anchor continued to share the breaking story;

“James led several fledging primary challenges to Faust in the lead up to the convention. Each openly stoking fears about the more radical elements of the Faust agenda on the debate stage over various points. Those also-ran candidates not only failed to secure the parties nomination from Faust but also lost their seats or positions to primaries, impeachments, resignation, or in one case a fatal boating accident. Outside of Mr. James lobbying though many Californians objected to now President-Elect Faust’s calls to turn the state into a full time Wildfire preserve, while others across the country believed that the relocation program is an acceptable and fair compromise as it would create jobs around the new industry and as one voter put it clean the stain of Hollywood from the American fabric. Ultimately it was Faust’s calls for increased spending on a stronger military and promises of capital punishment returning to federal cases mixed with his more liberal appealed like nationalizing hospitals to combat rising healthcare costs and a commitment to forgiving 100% of National student loan debt that attracted a winning and unique coalition”

Mason couldn’t help but laugh. Don’t forget the smelter thing he thought to himself. “Everyone loves the smelter thing”As if by some sinister magic a celebratory live cam of Faust supporters dancing around a red white and blue smelter with his visage on the top and what appeared to be a live eagle perched upon his outstretched arms appeared on the screen.

“I am now live on site in Milwaukee with DNC chairman Garth Wagner.” Lilith spoke louder so the chairmen could understand the audio transmission. “Mr. Chairman, with a super majority of Faust-Democrats in both chambers and two Supreme Court nominations all but guaranteed when the President-elect takes office do you feel this is the start of a lasting movement here in America?” Garth spoke directly to the camera, as if he knew that his former boss was watching “Winners get to make the tough calls not those clinging to some ideal that doesn’t represent the people. That’s how it’s always been and Lilith, Dr. Faust knows how to win. The budget, the loan forgiveness and the Smelt doctrine are all a done deal as far as I’m concerned.”

The news feed cuts back to Lilith Priestly who explains “The Smelt Doctrine as mentioned by DNC chairman Wagner moments ago is the voluntary and at times compulsory smelting of homeless populations. It was by far the most bi-partisan plank of the Faust campaign enjoying roughly 78% approval nation wide by time early voting began, much to the surprise of many early critics. “ Lilith paused and then begins again with a tone of breaking urgency and a hint of sorrow “With the last state calling this election I’ve been told that President-Elect Henry Faust and Vice President-Elect Carla Damian are about to speak for the first time since their historic win.”

The screen flashed over to the party again. The ballroom is bathed in a red hue as strobe lights go off and blue confetti falls around the smelter. A spotlight cuts through the party atmosphere to illuminate the winning ticket and their team on stage. Henry Faust waves to the crowd and gives the camera a smile. Mason James stands up as the screen clicks black.

[],False,,vishjay101,1614976742.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_am2qfuos,False,False,"I understand what you mean and see you where you're coming from, but New Orleans being a small market shouldn't prevent such moves from being made. Now, if you don't want to give up Brandon Ingram in a trade that nets the Pelicans Damian Lillard (which I agree with), then I totally respect your opinion and agree with you. I understand that the Pelicans are a small market team, but you have to keep in mind that you have Zion Williamson, a unique, transcendent, surefire future superstar. Not all teams have that or can say that moving forward looking ahead into the future.

To me, Zion and the sole purpose of maximizing him by proving it to him that the organization means business and is willing to cash in to show him that they are serious about building around him, competing both now and long-term, and assembling the best team around him to benefit what he does best, is the sole reason why you see these big name trades, whether it be for Lillard, Beal, or whatever other superstar that is hypothetically available. You have to remember that not every team has young transcendent player like Zion or a Zion-esque player (there are teams, but they are few and far between in the NBA today), and market size should not matter as it relates to maximizing special talents like Zion.

*Opportunity doesn't wait for you, and sometimes you need to seize it.*

In my opinion, this sentence and key point is what the central message behind the AD experience in New Orleans taught the fanbase, team, whole city, and the entire Pelicans organization. Therefore, although I understand it is unlikely Lillard becomes a Pelican without giving up Ingram (a young second star who like Zion, should be a major force in free agents considering New Orleans to have success in their careers), I feel going hard after Beal makes sense for the Pelicans. I say that because I still do feel it is possible and actually somewhat likely Beal gets traded to New Orleans without the Pelicans needing to give up Ingram. Also, as I mentioned, you appease Zion by establishing a Big 3 of Beal, Ingram, and Zion, as Beal would make the Pelicans legitimate contenders, looking at talent and fit alone.

I understand that the Pelicans play in a small market, but given that they have Zion on the team (and this time with Zion shouldn't be taken for granted), that fact should not stop them from making big moves. At the end of the day, life is short and this time with Zion (or any other player in the NBA playing on whatever franchise) is not unlimited. Hence, why not maximize Zion, show him you mean business by creating a competitive roster, and make him feel comfortable so that he stays in New Orleans long-term?

The Pelicans have learned from the Anthony Davis experience that sometimes making big moves, evaluating roster fit, and being bold to overcome this small market fear of making big moves is necessary for long-term success and keeping your star happy. Therefore, as a final note, I don't think it's hypocritical for the Pelicans to trade for a big name superstar who plays in a different small market to appease Zion. In the end, you need to fulfill your own priorities and not worry about being a small market and the top priority of utmost importance is keeping Zion happy and making sure you have a competitive roster optimizing his strengths always.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1625102212.0,,1625104060.0,0.0,{},h3movmg,False,t3_oaehc3,False,t1_h3movmg,True,t1_h3h4w0e,/r/NOLAPelicans/comments/oaehc3/yall_can_calm_ya_tits_now/h3movmg/,1652765277.0,1.0,False,True,False,NOLAPelicans,t5_2vppf,r/NOLAPelicans,public,,0.0,[],,,,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt; Abstract: While machine learning algorithms excel at many challenging visual tasks, it is unclear that they can make predictions about commonplace real world physical events. Here, we present a visual and physical prediction benchmark that precisely measures this capability. In realistically simulating a wide variety of physical phenomena -- rigid and soft-body collisions, stable multi-object configurations, rolling and sliding, projectile motion -- our dataset presents a more comprehensive challenge than existing benchmarks. Moreover, we have collected human responses for our stimuli so that model predictions can be directly compared to human judgments. We compare an array of algorithms -- varying in their architecture, learning objective, input- output structure, and training data -- on their ability to make diverse physical predictions. We find that graph neural networks with access to the physical state best capture human behavior, whereas among models that receive only visual input, those with object-centric representations or pretraining do best but fall far short of human accuracy. This suggests that extracting physically meaningful representations of scenes is the main bottleneck to achieving human-like visual prediction. We thus demonstrate how our benchmark can identify areas for improvement and measure progress on this key aspect of physical understanding.

Throughout the program, there were young female agents that Carrie had to work with and live with. One was financial analyst Fara Sherazi in season three and four, as well as BND field agent Astrid in season five. Even though Fara and Astrid initially looked to Carrie for cooperation and inspiration, when Fara passed S4, Max told Carrie that all Fara wanted was to get Carrie's approval. Carrie often underestimated her. On the S3 storyline This even led Fara to question her values ​​and finally leave the series in season 4.

The tragic outcome for Astrid in season six, who followed Quinn out of love and always tried to lean in everything she's doing. Unfortunately, Quinn was always distant. This even led the hitman to question her feelings for him and finally they both leave the series in season 6.

For their dedication and loyalty to Carrie, Quinn, CIA, BND, Germany and the US in S3, S4, S5 and S6, these women deserved guidance, affection, and certainly more recognition for their hard work.

**Peter Quinn's Death**

There was at least an effort by the showrunners to try and fill the void left by Brody. Peter Quinn rose from being a supporting character to a key character. He even had a relationship with Carrie, just like Brody. The message kinda was: we are sorry for taking away your favorite character but here's another good one.

But then Peter Quinn was also killed off in a brutal manner. He drove a Chevy Suburban through a hail of bullets and died with his head on the wheel. Fans were so angered by the death that a group named #NotOurHomeland wrote a long letter to the showrunner, lamenting about the turn of events, and paid the Hollywood Reporter to publish it.

**Nicholas Brody's Death**

The decision to kill off one of the two best characters was a misinformed one. Part of what made the first three seasons so great was the presence of the radicalized Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis). His interactions with CIA agent Carrie Mathison were amazing. She was doing her best to bring him down yet she couldn't help but grow emotionally attached to him.

Sadly, in the third season, he was sacrificed to give viewers a shocking death. Shocking indeed as he was hanged from a crane courtesy of a death sentence in Iran. Movie and TV deaths can make the plot even better, but Damian Lewis was too good as Brody (he won an Emmy) and the void he left was always felt.

At minimum, do Jason as The Red Hood, Tim or Damian as Robin (I haven’t read any Robin comics in a while, I don’t know who has what mantle anymore) and one as Dick as Nightwing. Feel free to have some crossover, but not much, maybe use Barbara as Oracle/Batgirl to tie them in together. Use the shows to introduce and develop the characters, then a film to bring them all together. Have the shows based around a common threat they’re not aware of m, something operating in the shadows (part of the League of Assassins) and the film deals with them all together defeating whatever the threat is. 

Half a dozen to ten episodes each, 45 minutes long. Tim’s story is a more detective based one, Jason is trying to deal with an aggressive threat to the streets very action-y, Dick is struggling in Blüdhaven trying to keep the city from boiling over. Maybe blend story elements together and do something like No Man’s Land, those operating behind the scenes have been trying to keep Batman away from his allies by keeping them too busy separately, when they finally realise what’s happened they rush to help but a series of explosions destroys key infrastructure around Gotham, including Wayne Towers and the mansion and caves beneath. They’re trying to keep everything from falling apart, doing their best, but it ends with Gotham fractured. Movie includes references to War for the Cowl, Bruce/Batman missing presumed dead, Gotham in shambles, the family step up to work together dealing with the threats but come to the conclusion that Gotham needs Batman and one of them has to take over. After credits scene with Bruce being shown *somewhere* still alive but captured. 

This is sixty seconds of rambling. Would need further development but there’s so many options. Second season could deal with them fighting in No Man’s Land Gotham, feature them dealing with the likes of Penguin trying to become emperor of his own little kingdom, be interesting to feature Poison Ivy, Catwoman and Harley trying to help out in their own twisted little ways. Give the Gotham City Sirens a show. Jason, Dick and Tim conflicted with one another in regards to how to protect a Gotham that’s shattered. Damian could return to Gotham (with his mother and the League, maybe) taking territory and leaving the Bat symbol everywhere. They team up in movie two to rescue Bruce. Court of Owls interferes in the rebuilding, Talons introduced in season three, including trying to recruit Dick.

I walked in to the chamber of the Champion and I was standing face to face with my rival and the Pokemon League Champion Blue.  
  
***“Hey, v0rt3x!”***  
  
“Hey Blue!”  
  
***“I was looking forward to seeing you, v0rt3x.”***  
  
“I bet you were.”  
  
***“My rival should be strong to keep me sharp.”***  
  
“Okay.”  
  
***“While working on my Pokedex, I looked all over for Pokemon. Not only that, I assembled teams that would beat any Pokemon type. And now…”***  
  
“Now what?”  
  
***“I’m the Pokemon League champion! v0rt3x, do you know what that means?”***  
  
“I’m sure you’ll tell me.”  
  
***“ I am the most powerful trainer in the world!”***   
  
This battle with Blue was going to be different. This was no longer an ordinary rival battle. This was the battle to decide who would become the Champion of the Kanto region. And honestly, I couldn’t have asked for a better opponent.  
  
\- Just like in our previous battles, Blue opened with Pidgeot. I had Damian in front of my party. It used Sand Attack to lower Damian’s accuracy on the first turn. Damian responded with Thunderbolt that did a little less than half. Pidgeot then used Featherdance to drop Damian’s attack as he missed Body Slam right after. Pidgeot used Sand Attack on the next turn again as Damian missed another Body Slam. It finally hit Damian with an Aerial Ace which did about 50 damage. Damian finally used Body Slam which did less damage because of the Featherdance but managed to paralyse Pidgeot. Having recovered some HP with the Leftovers, Damian was able to KO Pidgeot on the next turn with Thunderbolt.  
  
\- Blue’s second Pokemon was Alakazam. I switched out to Pex. Alakazam used Reflect on the switch turn to boost its team’s Defense. Pex tried to set up a Double Team but Alakazam hit super hard with Psychic getting Pex to 58/172 HP, as well as getting the Special Defense drop. Pex did manage to set up that Double Team. I used a Full Restore on her, the first of 3 as Alakazam used Future Sight. However, on the next turn Alakazam took advantage of the Special Defense drop and KO’d Pex with Psychic. I was devastated. Pex was the very first Pokemon I had caught and now… she was just gone. I felt horrible but I knew I had to keep going. I brought Shelly in. I used Protect on the first turn as Alakazam’s Reflect wore off. But I forgot about the Future Sight and took quite a bit of damage anyway. I had to switch so I brought in King. King was hit hard by a Psychic getting it down to 62/169 HP, and was given the Special Defense drop as well. I had a bad feeling about this. I decided to try my best and went for Flamethrower as Alakazam used Future Sight again. King did about half damage with Flamethrower. I knew that even on half health, Alakazam would take down King on the next turn so I hoped to damage it as much as possible with an Extremespeed. Goodbye King, thank you- wait.. King managed to KO the Alakazam on that turn without even getting a crit. WHAT! KING, YOU BEAUTIFUL DOGGO!  
  
\- Blue’s third Pokemon was Rhydon. I switched out to Nessy since Shelly had already taken damage from the battle with Alakazam. Rhydon used Rock Tomb that got Nessy to 102/218 HP, and got the Speed drop too. To make matters worse, Nessy took the Future Sight and was left on just 6 HP. I knew a Surf could KO the Rhydon but Nessy would not be able to outspeed and using a Full Restore on her was illogical. What wasn’t illogical was using it on Shelly. That way Shelly could get a clean switch in and take out the Rhydon. I looked at Nessy and she looked back at me. She knew it had to be done so Nessy was ready to sacrifice herself for the team. Thank you so much for everything Nessy! I’ll make sure that your sacrifice does not go in vain. I got Shelly back to full as Blue’s Rhydon took out Nessy with an Earthquake. I looked Blue straight in the eye and told him that this battle was just beginning. I brought Shelly out and as I had thought, OHKO’d Rhydon with Surf. Nessy’s sacrifice did not go in vain.  
  
\- Blue’s fourth Pokemon was Venusaur. I switched to Empress as Venusaur charged up a Solar Beam on the first turn. I knew Solar Beam would not be able to OHKO Empress so I used my third and final Full Restore of the battle on King. The Solar Beam hit and Empress lived it on 53/173 HP. Venusaur charged up another Solar Beam as I tried to use Fire Blast but it missed. Venusaur would 110% take out Empress with the next hit but it wouldn’t take out King. So, I made the switch and as expected the Solar Beam did less than half. King outsped and used Flamethrower on the next turn which did about 75% damage to Venusaur, who used Growth to increase its Attack and Special Attack but that did not matter as King was able to KO on the next turn with a second Flamethrower.  
  
\- Blue’s fifth Pokemon was Gyarados. It got the Intimidate Attack drop on King but that would not matter because my plan was to switch in Damian and KO it with Thunderbolt. I did just that and Damian barely took damage from Hydro Pump. Damian was able to KO with two Thunderbolts, taking a bit of damage from Dragon Rage and Thrash on those two turns.  
  
\- Blue’s final Pokemon was Arcanine. I thought Damian would be able to finish off the Arcanine with a Body Slam + Hyper Beam combination but then Blue said,   
  
***“If I’m going down, I’m taking you down with me!”***  
  
\- And… Arcanine CRIT with Extremespeed and took down Damian. “NO NO NO NO”, I yelled in real life. It was another loss that I was not expecting. I’m so sorry Damian. You were one of the strongest Pokemon on my team and your bulk really helped in a lot of key battles. Thank you for everything. Rest in peace.   
  
“You’re going to pay for that, Blue!”  
  
\- I said as I switched in Shelly. Shelly was there with me since day one. She was my first Pokemon. She was there when I won my first battle. She was there when I caught my first Pokemon. She was there when I won my first Gym Badge. I could not think of a better Pokemon to finish the battle.   
  
“Shelly, use Surf!”  
  
\- It was over. Arcanine lay on the ground with swirls in its eyes. The referee called out:

[],False,,FixASofa,1616779920.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_b5qs0qjy,False,False,"Hey guys! Welcome back to the seventh update of my Genlocke. For a quick recap, in the last update my team and I took down the Saffron City Gym Leader Sabrina and earned the Marsh Badge. Today we will get the two final Kanto Gym Badges.   
  
Team:  
  
Shelly the Blastoise  
Pex the Pidgeot  
Empress the Nidoqueen  
King the Growlithe  
Damian the Snorlax  
  
Six badges! I just need to get two more and I can compete in the Pokemon League! But before that, I need to get a new sixth team member. In the last update, we lost Rox to Sabrina’s Mr. Mime. It was a shocking death. The Pokemon I considered using were:  
  
Molly the Gastly  
Meh the Nidorino  
Nessy the Lapras.  
  
I chose not to use Molly because a) I could not get a Gengar because of my emulator and b) I would have to grind her up so much because I haven’t used her in a single battle.  
  
I chose not to go for Meh either because I don’t want to have both Nidos together. They’re the same type and while I could try to have different movesets on them because of their amazing TM pool, having two Ground-Poison types isn’t a good idea for type diversity.

I settled on Nessy as the sixth team member for now. I know her type overlaps with Shelly but she has the added Ice type. Because of this, I now don’t have to run an Ice type attack on Shelly to use against Lance and if anything ever goes wrong, I can use her as a sacrifice (which I hope does not happen of course). Welcome to the team Nessy! I immediately taught her Surf.  
  
Then, I went back to Vermillion City and found Professor Oak’s aide in the gate connecting Routes 11 and 12 and got the Itemfinder from him for catching 30 species of Pokemon. I used the Itemfinder to pick up Leftovers from where the two Snorlax’ were - on Route 12 and 16. Since I was on Route 16, I went to the Celadon Game Corner and picked up a Mystic Water.   
  
I flew back home to Pallet Town and visited my mom and Professor Oak and told them all about my journey. Professor Oak suggested that I follow the Route 21 sea path and go to Cinnabar Island and take on the Gym Leader there. I chose to do just that.  
  
I battled all the Route 21 trainers and a few wild Pokemon to train Nessy up. She eventually learnedIce Beam at level 31. On Cinnabar Island, I walked in to the Cinnabar Pokemon Lab. Over here I restored my two fossils. I now had Not Helix the Kabuto and Ptera the Aerodactyl in the box. I don’t know how nuzlocke rules affect these encounters but as per Pokemon Challenges’ the met location of a Pokemon decides its location so it’d be Cinnabar Island. I’ll count Ptera as my encounter here but I will keep Not Helix in the box.  
  
I tried to enter the Cinnabar Gym next but it was locked so I decided to explore the Pokemon Mansion. My encounter here was a Weezing that exploded right in front of me. While in the mansion, I learned about Mew and Mewtwo. Apparently Mew is the mother of Mewtwo. Interesting stuff. I battled all the scientists and burglars in here to level up Nessy. I found the Secret Key which was actually the key to the Cinnabar Gym.   
  
In the Cinnabar Gym, you have the option to battle Gym Trainers. You can either battle them and move on or you can answer a question and if you get it right, you can move on and if you get it wrong, you have to battle the trainers. I chose to battle all the Gym Trainers anyway and after defeating the last trainer Nessy was at level 38.   
  
Blaine is a Fire type Gym Leader with 4 Pokemon - a level 42 Growlithe, a level 40 Ponyta, a level 42 Rapidash and his ace, a level 47 Arcanine. Our team is looking strong. The two key Pokemon for this Gym were Nessy at level 38 and Shelly at level 45. Let’s do this:  
  
***“I am Blaine, the red hot leader of the Cinnabar Gym! My fiery Pokemon are all rough and ready with intense heat! They incinerate all challengers! Hah! You better have Burn Heal!***  
  
Big words considering Blaine got destroyed! Let’s just say, Rain Dance + Mystic Water on a Lapras = SWEEP! Having set up a Rain Dance on the first turn against the Growlithe, Nessy sweeped the rest of Blaine’s team in one hit. Growlithe gone. Ponyta gone. Rapidash was able to Bounce once but gone. Arcanine however hit super hard with a Fire Blast that Nessy lived on 2 HP but Nessy OHKO’d it with a crit Surf. DANG! Nessy was the perfect sixth team member haha.. what a sweep! Good job Nessy!  
  
***“I have burned down to nothing! Not even ashes remain! You have earned the Volcano Badge!”***  
  
Looks like Blaine was the one who got incinerated. Anyway, I got the Volcano Badge, the seventh Kanto Gym Badge as well as TM38 Fire Blast.

For a quick recap, in the last update my team and I took down the Fuchsia City Gym Leader Koga and earned the Soul Badge. Today we begin the journey to Saffron City.   
  
Team:   
Shelly the Blastoise  
Pex the Pidgeot  
Empress the Nidoqueen  
Rox the Graveler  
King the Growlithe  
Damian the Snorlax  


Having defeated Koga in the last update, my team and I will take on the ‘hardest’ Kanto Gym Leader Sabrina. But before that, we have a few errands to run in Celadon City and another encounter with Team Rocket.  
  
Using Pex to fly to Celadon, I entered the Pokemon Mansion first and got the Tea from the old woman. I will need it to progress to Saffron City. Then, in the department store, I picked up some Super Potions and Repels and a Fire Stone. I will use this Fire Stone to evolve King into an Arcanine when it reaches level 49 and learns Flamethrower.  Next, I grabbed the Coin Case from a man going through an existential crisis in a restaurant. I wanted to get the TM for Ice Beam from the Celadon GIft Shop (I guess) but I did not have enough coins to buy it. Having completed my errands in Celadon, I left from the east onto Route 7 and into the gate where I bribed the guard with the Tea I got. Saffron City, here I come.  
  
The first thing I did in Saffron City was take on the Fighting Dojo. I sweeped it with Pex and picked up a Hitmonlee named Kirk. I was not going to be using this Hitmonlee and the only reason why I picked it is so I could have a Hitmonchan in a future game. I don’t really like any of the Hitmon Pokemon but Hitmonchan is the only one I could bring myself to using.   
  
I entered Silph Co. because the front door guard was busy napping. After about 15 minutes of trying to figure out where I had to go and countless battles with Team Rocket grunts and scientists, I ran into a familiar face.  
  
***“What kept you, v0rt3x? Hahaha! I thought you’d turn up if I waited here!”***  
  
“Hello Blue!” I said to my rival as we began our sixth battle of the nuzlocke. As always he had his now Pidgeot in front and I opened with Rox. On the first turn, it lowered Rox’s attack with Featherdance so it took two Rock Slides to KO the Pidgeot, with Rox resisting a sliver of Wing Attack damage. Up next was his starter, now a Venusaur. I switched to King as it missed a Razor Leaf on the first turn. It then outsped (probably because it was 5 levels higher) and put King to sleep with Sleep Powder and lowered his evasiveness with Sweet Scent on the next turn. On the next turn, it crit with Razor Leaf and got King down to 18 HP but King woke up and did a bit of damage with Flame Wheel but managed to score a burn. Burn not only damages a Pokemon but also lowers its Attack stat. I used a Hyper Potion to get King back to full as he resisted a Razor Leaf that now did less than half. Venusaur put King to sleep again and I used an Awakening as Vensaur hit with Razor Leaf again. Venusaur was looking extremely low but for some reason it used Sweet Scent again as King woke up and finished it off with Flame Wheel. Gyarados came out and I switched to Damian since I’d taught him Shock Wave. Damian got flinched with Bite on the first turn and handled a Dragon Rage pretty well before two shotting Gyarados with Shock Wave. Next was Growlithe who was one shot by Shelly with Surf. Finally for Blue was his Alakazam who was 3 shotted by Shelly’s Bite because it used Calm Mind + Reflect to improve its defenses. 6-0 B\*\*ch! (sorry lol)  
  
***“I’m going to the Pokemon League to boot out the Elite Four. I’ll become the world’s most powerful Trainer!***  
  
Bruh, you can’t even defeat me once in six battles. Good luck.  
  
After defeating Blue, I received the gift Lapras from a Silph employee (I think) and named her Nessy. After defeating one final Team Rocket grunt, I opened up the door to the board room with the Card Key and in front of me stood Giovanni.  
  
***“Ah, v0rt3x! So we meet again! The president and I are discussing a vital business proposition. Keep your nose out of grown up matters, or experience a world of pain!”***  
  
I had Shelly in front because Giovanni is notoriously known as a user of Ground type Pokemon. He opened with a Nidorino who was two shotted by Surf but was able to poison Shelly with Poison Sting. Up next was Nidoqueen who was also two shotted having dealt a bit of Poison Sting damage. Next was Kangaskhan. I switched to Damian because Shelly was on 35HP and Damian had a secret move to take on Normal types. Kangaskhan used Rage on the first turn and dealt a bit of damage and then made the mistake of using Tail Whip, as Damien ‘focused’ up and OHKO’d it with Focus Punch. Finally was Rhyhorn was also one shotted by Damien’s Focus Punch as it missed Rock Blast in between turns. Giovanni was done.  
  
***“Blast it all! You ruined our plans for Silph! But, Team Rocket will never fall! v0rt3x! Never forget that all Pokemon exist for Team Rocket!***   
  
Giovanni said as he left Silph Co.

Mid-80’s “high-tech” thriller that squandered any potential it had with an aimless storyline and milquetoast performance from lead Joseph Bottoms. The tech element is laughable, even by 80’s standards, but at least brings a dose of stupidity into the boredom. It’s the high point of a film which can’t even leverage a notable amount of T&amp;A into any form of excitement. Directed by Nico Mastorakis. I’ll stick with his sleaze epic, Island of Death.

A film that starts off very strong with its portrayal of a cinema-obsessed young man suffering under the verbal abuse of a domineering aunt and the desire to live his life in the films he adores devolves into a goofy, fun revenge-cum-slasher film in its final half. Dennis Christopher turns in a remarkable lead performance as disaffected film nerd Dennis Binford. He injects pathos into the role turning a veritable creep into someone for whom you feel pity. Also of note performance-wise is Tim Thomerson as the goofy, coke sniffing, harmonica playing social worker Dr. Jerry Moriarty and Eve Brent as the rotten Aunt Stella Binford. Her character and the intimations of incest between her and her nephew/adopted son give the first half of this film a vibe similar to Butcher Baker Nightmare Maker (AKA Night Warnings). That film was made a year after Fade to Black. While I can’t confirm this, it’s fun to think that the idea for BBNM was born out of the potential the first half of this film holds. That’s not knocking the second half. The slasher elements are over-the-top fun. Watching Dennis get his revenge on those that treated him poorly is the cathartic release it’s meant to be and the image of him dressed as Hopalong Cassidy, made up in terrifying foam appliances painted in a gross skin tone, is truly unnerving. All in all, it’s a mixed bag that makes it out alive thanks to strong performances and the wack-a-doodle nature of its story.   

    
**Крик о Помощи** (1984)

I’m not sure if this mid-80’s Soviet drama was initially aired on television or in the theater. It’s split into two parts which makes me think the former. No bother, what we have is a seemingly true-to-life look at the wayward youth of the era. The first half features excellent documentary-style footage of a large gang of youths on motorcycles. It’s this genuine footage that elevates this film into interesting viewing. To be at an age when the future is uncertain in a country with an even more uncertain future must have been demoralizing. A Cry for Help captures that and more. Not available with subtitles. 

  
**The New Gladiators AKA Rome 2033: The Fighter Centurions** (1984) 

Lucio Fulci’s last gasp in the post-apocalypse genre is z-grade fun from beginning to end. The patently fake miniatures of an eternally dark Rome in 2072 look more like a colony on Mars than the historic city. If not for the Coliseum and the Vatican making their appearance you’d think we had stumbled into an aborted attempt at Total Recall. Those two buildings are not the only holdovers of a past life. Our heroes and their antagonistic foils battle it out on KTM motorcycles with combustion engines. Those bikes bring the majority of the action as they and their riders are engaged in Kill Bike, a television show for the blood thirsty masses. It’s all rote and features little of Fulci’s flair that he had so successfully put into his films of just a few years prior. As a fan of the man’s work (great, good and bad) I enjoyed this piece of trash. Anyone without the patience for such things should just rewatch The Running Man.

  
**The Death and Resurrection Show** (2013)

An absolutely killer doc that through chaotic editing and degraded archival footage perfectly captures the madness that is the band Killing Joke. Unsurprisingly focused on Jaz Coleman and his unhinged genius for a majority of the running time. The rest of the band gets their say leading to a well rounded picture of the group and its trajectory over its 40+ year career. Maybe only for fans but whatever. Killing Joke is phenomenal and this doc is just another reason why.  

  
**Plan B** (2021)

Another year, another duo of teenage girls in a raunchy adventure. This film is not as strong as Booksmart, suffering mainly from dialogue that hits like it was written by a 30 year old whose access to teens is through Tik Tok. Regardless, the film surprises with a twist and a willingness to get X-rated with an unbelievable penis prosthetic. I was on the fence for the first 30 minutes but by the end was fully onboard. I hope this trend continues. As much as I love raunchy teen comedies, seeing them from a male POV has grown stale. 

  
**Caveat** (2021)

An impressive debut from Damian Mc Carthy that rises above its flaws by dint of its effectively creepy atmosphere and ambiguous story. I didn’t expect much and was surprised by what I got. Reminiscent of Brad Anderson’s Session 9 but with characters I liked. The corpse is terrifying and reminded me of the reveal of the nurse’s dead ward in Mario Bava’s Black Sabbath. I’ve said it numerous times but it always bears repeating, the world needs more independent genre films like this. It’s easy to imagine that if Mc Carthy keeps this up he’ll be helming a low key horror for A24 in the near future. 

   
**Mainstream** (2021)

Andrew Garfield was seemingly born to play self-obsessed assholes. His character in this could easily be a cousin to his character in Under the Silver Lake. I like the latter film much more but still recommend this one. Not great but not terrible, it skirts by on the strength of the lead performances and a commitment to its aesthetic.  

  
**Women in Cages** (1971)

Following the same setup and story as Roger Corman’s other WIP flicks of the time does not stop Women in Cages from being a hoot. Pam Grier dominates the film as the wicked warden. Like Tura Santana in Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill!, Ms. Grier is strikingly beautiful and intimidatingly tough with a natural screen presence no amount of formal training can conjure. She is the epitome of a movie star. The scenes of her torturing her inmates are framed like they were torn straight out of an EC comic and lit under the guidance of Mario Bava. It’s not a stretch to say that Gerardo De León’s direction elevates the unoriginal plot into something supremely entertaining and that his fabulous blocking makes one feel at times as if they’ve stumbled into an arthouse film masquerading as exploitation. I love it when a film contains that dichotomy.

Here are some underrated and/or undervalued keys you may be interested in (Raw/ungraded):



Brave and the Bold 200 - First appearance of Katana and also The Outsiders.

Batman 417 - First appearance of KGBeast

Batman 368 - Jason Todd officially becomes the second Robin.

Batman 332 - First Catwoman solo story

Batman 442 - First Tim Drake in a Robin costume

Batman 326 - First 'appearance' of Arkham Asylum (It was previously referred to as ""Arkham Hospital"").

Batman 570 - Second appearance of Harley Quinn, first appearance in an ongoing title (In mainline continuity)

Batman 363 - First (full) appearance of Nocturna

Batman 657 - First cover appearance of Damian Wayne.

Batman 638 - Red Hood revealed to be Jason Todd

Batman 489 - Second appearance of Bane

Batman 450&amp; 451 - No keys here, just really cool Joker covers.  And a slight continuation/tie-in of the Death in the Family story and what Joker is up to afterwards.

Batman 400 - Stephen King essay forward, classic Sienkiewicz cover

Batman 475 - First appearance of Renee Montoya

Batman: Sword of Azrael 1 - First appearance of Azrael

Batman 567 - First appearance of Cassandra Cain 

Detective Comics 647 - First appearance of Spoiler (Might as well get 648 and 649 as well to complete the story since they're cheap).



These are all issues you can get for less than 100 dollars, some of them far less.   


Some of the ones that are a bit more costly but still 'cheap' (in my opinion) are:


Batman 386 - First appearance of Black Mask

Batman 635 - First Red Hood (Jason Todd version)

Vengeance of Bane 1 - First appearance of Bane

Tales of the New Teen Titans 44 - First appearance of Nightwing.  I think Grayson has been either with the Teen Titans or solo longer than he was Robin but he's still always been heavily connected to Batman so I threw this one in there.


Tangentially related:

Suicide Squad 23 - First 'appearance' of Oracle.  This one is weird because it's just Barbara's speech bubble emanating from a computer.  But the community has largely decided that this ""counts"" so...

Suicide Squad 38 - Barbara Gordon revealed to be Oracle.  Personally I like this one more because you can actually see her in front of her computer station.

Suicide Squad 48 - Post-Killing Joke tie-in.

Suicide Squad 49 - Same, but with a super dope cover.



There's plenty more out there but just some ones to look at if you're interested.  Lately I've been trying to snag as much cheap Bat related stuff as I can just in case the speculator 'Eye of Sauron' turns its gaze over here and ruins the prices for everyone.  For example, it's one of the worst possible times right now if you were a new collector and were really interested in the legendary Claremont X-Men run.  People are jumping on anything and everything in anticipation for the next several years of mutant movies and they haven't even been announced yet.  This has driven prices for many of those issues sky-high.  


Just this week one of the most popular Youtube 'spec bros' mentioned that DC keys are undervalued and that maybe people should start paying more attention to them.  Wasn't a fan of that because as a DC guy it's been nice to be able to find a bunch of good stuff for reasonable prices without the astronomical price inflating that's going on with Marvel titles these days.  I always wanted a really good copy of X-Men 101 but I drug my feet for years and now that ship has sailed for me personally, probably for the indefinite future.

Sure, maybe I could agree with that, *if we saw literally any of that arc.*

If you want to do such a drastic character change, you *have* to build to it.

And on top of that, no, he's not ""really old."" Ben Affleck is 48, assuming that this version of Bruce Wayne is meant to be roughly around his age that would put him anywhere from early 40's to late 50's. *Dark Knight Rises* Batman is really old. Early 40's to late 50's is arguably where most Batman stories take place, given that he began his career as Batman at 26, got Dick Grayson after a few years, and after about a decade Dick swapped to Nightwing and so on - meaning anything Jason Todd and forward he's gotta at least be getting close to 40, and anything with Tim Drake or Damian would easily put him in his 50's or 60's.

It wasn't liked because it was a drastic change to a beloved character with no *good* reason, no buildup, and little payoff. It's not even treated as a big deal that he's using guns and murdering people.

And for the record, Snyder himself disagrees with your explanation.

It doesn't take a smart coach to just decide to put the ball in the hands of your best player and let him do most of the work.

But the reality is for so many postseasons, especially for someone at Damian's size, playoff defenses can key in and defend him much better, which is why Damians playoff numbers at time don't look great. 

And it really doesn't matter what kind of talent you put next to Damian, unless they're a top 10, maybe top 5 player, the Blazers will continue to struggle with Damian being tasked to do everything.

By getting Damian to operate off the ball, he retains a lot of value as there are more opportunities for him to be a scoring threat, allowing him to continue to maintain more pressure on defenses.

Portland vs Nuggets game analysis

Portland shot exceptionally poor last game especially from the 3 point line. There were a lot of forced shots and contested shots coming from Carmelo Anthony. Damian Lillard took a lot of deep threes that he's no stranger to hitting but they were definitely not high quality shots and seemed like heat checks type of shots when he wasn't even on fire. The Blazers came out blazing last game and got up to an early double digit lead but proceeded to give up a 15-0 run off of some very bad shots in the latter of the first quarter and were never able to retake the lead as they game within 4 in the 3rd quarter, and tied the game up late in the fourth but Austin Rivers scored 4 3s in a row to put the dagger in the game. A major factor in the game not going in the favor of the Blazers was foul trouble by Nurkic earlier on, forcing him eventually to sit after 6 fouls in the 4th quarter and as a result there was a lot of undersized guards taking on Jokic i n the midrange zone causing more forced fouls and put the Nuggets in the bonus early on IN EVERY QUARTER. The role players did not really play a role in the Blazer's offense, and it does make sense for a team like Portland since they've relied on their starting lineup and their bench doesn't go deep so they play to their strengths. In game 3, Nurkic was again in foul trouble early, giving Jokic a lot of free reign in the paint where he put up another monster game and forced other people into foul trouble, I think the Blazers have a serious issue with fouling as well, they often commit fouls that are completely unnecessary and don't really think strategically when making decisions about putting their opponents in the bonus early on.

On the side of the Nuggets they played a solid game and executed their game plan. However, what really stood out to me was the abilitiy of the role players to step out throughout different stages of the game. JaMyhcal green put up some great early numbers to feed into an early run. Campazzo really stepped up as well throughout with some great hustle plays and great playmaking through finding Jokic in a favorable spot in the paint and allowing him to either get an easy bucket or a forced foul when he was on a smaller defender. The playmaking was nothing exceptional but it was very sound, every play was either feeding a mismatch or distributing the ball to the open man. Late in the game it was Austin Rivers who single handedly fended off against a great comeback by the Blazers, hitting 2 contested 3s and a wide open one. Their keys to victory has been off of Jokic and the 3 point shooters he leaves open when he draws multiple defenders in the paint and he kicks it out or draws on early foul.

Conclusion:

I think there's a few interesting things in this series so far that means you can't really say Portland is out of it simply judging on how games have been going recently. The number 1 thing to watch out for tonight is if the coaching staff of Portland can seriously drill home the fact that they must be strategic about committing fouls or adjusting how Jokic is defended such that they have Nurkic for them on the offensive end who's been great at getting 2nd chance opportunities. The second key to victory is if Portland can play a sound game on their end, they need to do slightly better but not much better at hitting their shots, and also simply passing up on bad looks by CJ or Dame.

I think that based on my observations, Portland has a lot more room for improvement in their game that can be made rather than the Nuggets. I think if Portland start playing a more sound game, it's much easier for them to adjust in this series going forward. I don't have a ton of confidence in the coaching staff of the Blazers, but I think if any of them have any desire to win and go back and watch the film, it'll be easy for them to figure out just why they're losing these games and easy for them to make an adjustment and come out hot and win by double digits.

[],False,,bluelookslikeblue,1590466485.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4k59o4b4,False,False,"1.) Despite being a Titans Academy Hater (tm), I am going to be fair and defend Sheridan on this one. One of the key problems with this book is how thin it is spread by ten thousand different plot points and characters. They do not need to add even more. For example, I was excited by the prospect of seeing the OG New Teen Titans go on a mission, but they just succeed off-panel because they needed to get back to the other stuff. This sort of thing would be even more common if they added another load of characters. I understand that everyone has their favorite characters and wants them to be in stuff. I know I do. But even though I like Superman, I would rather have Superman not be in a comic at all if the alternative is him just takin up space in the corner of panels and maybe getting one line of dialogue every two to three issues because then he's just distracting. 

2.) Ambivalent on this one. OOH, new characters can help break stagnation and introduce new stories but OTOH, given how thinly this book is spread, having to introduce all the new characters and their powers and personalities eats up valuable page space that they need for all the other crap they're doing. Plus, a lot of Damian's kids are fairly new, so it feels like they're being squeezed out a bit by the new-new kids. 

3.) You are absolutely correct here. The key problem with this book is that it uses the characters to develop events instead of using events to develop characters. The series feels like it's rushing through a checklist and as a result nothing carries the weight it should. Like, the only person to express any concern about poor Superboy was Kid Flash because ain't nobody got time for that crap, we got stuff to get through. RED X! FUTURE STATE! SQUIRRELL! FORTY-SEVEN! 

4.) Mostly agree here. I think they could use a more consistent focus, but didn't necessarily need to confine themselves to one character so much as one group. Like, it could be from the perspective of the teachers or a handful of the new kids or whatever. But they are absolutely spread too thin. 

Ending on a positive note, I will say the book has some good ideas. I think the OG New Teen Titans are a good team which have some of my favorite characters. It's nice to see Raven, Beast Boy, and Starfire allowed to get into their twenties and reunite with their old buddies instead of being kicked back to their teens again. The art is solid.

If you watch other top teams run offenses you will see that they are more flexible and adaptable. We have 4 types of offensive sets:

Dame/CJ Pick-and-rolls (when facing decent defenders these are often blitzed leading to an early pass to Nurk followed by an offensive foul when he turns and barrels over the rotating help defender)

Getting Nurk the ball at the top of the key to make passes to back-door cutters. (Out of the four, I find this one to be particularly underutilized.)

CJ isolations (almost never passes out of them)

Melo Post-ups (never ever passes out of them)

That's it. That's what we do. We typically do each of those things pretty well, but those are all of the things. It's four things to gameplan for. There are no sets that are run explicitly for anyone besides Dame, CJ, Melo, and Nurk. If two (or sometimes even just one) of those players are having an off game, we will lose that game. 

Norm Powell likes playing with the ball in his hand, and is a strong finisher going to the basket. But I only know this information because every once in a while he accidentally ends up with the ball in transition or after an offensive rebound. We don't get him any real looks besides kicking the ball out to him from Dame drives to the basket or the occasional pass from Nurk on the back door cut. This is an obvious under utilization of his skill set. 

Damian Lillard is fantastic on offense off the ball. He shoots the 3 at a higher percentage off the catch than of the dribble, but he only has 2 catch-and-shoot 3PA a game compared to 8 3PA off the dribble. The situation is similar with CJ. I have watched enough Warriors' games to know that getting your best shooters open catch-and-shoot looks off of screens is a good feature to include in an effective offense. We very rarely do this.

Our offense is effective in the regular season, when every team has a day or two to prepare between games in different cities with different opponents. But when they have more than 48 hours to prepare, our offense is not difficult to stop, and Terry doesn't have any wrinkles that aren't on every single game tape from this season. The same thing happens in the playoffs every year. And every year people defend Terry using his regular season results. But if you ever see Dame win a ring with the Blazers then it's clear that Terry will not be coaching the team when that happens.

I had sort of paced myself on running through the initial challenges, but I finally had a block of time so I went for it.  I know some of these challenges are giving folks trouble, and so... with a BIG APOLOGY to my current gen brethren (I have seen the videos, that shit is unfair) - here are some of the thoughts and tips while they are fresh in my mind.

OVERALL TIPS:

\- Always include Butler, Lillard, and Worthy in your active starting lineup to ensure they get the coach boost (I have D'Antoni)

\- For every game where I need to win, I simply curry-slid into a 3 pointer from either Jimmy Butler or Damian Lillard.  Their shots have slightly different timings, and I personally prefer Butler's - it's easier to green.  By the end of this, I was shooting either 7/7 to 7/9 with Butler.  My assumption is if you got to these challenges, you can score at any time, with any player.  It's boring and repetitive, but works.

\- For every single game, I choose the ""Smother"" Defensive option for all 3 players.  That's L1 on PS, pick your player, R2 over to the ""On-Ball"" menu, and pick ""Smother.""

\- turn off the Shot Meter and Shot Feedback. It’s unclear if it helped, but it *seemed* to make it easier for me to green.

\- In general, the key on Next Gen is to play defense.  That's what got me through all the Game 3 - Win by 7's in the normal spotlights.  Even if you can't shoot 3's, if you can play defense you will win.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Win by 5 or More - very easy.
2. 8 Rebounds With James Worthy - I know people have had nightmares with this one.  The craziest thing is that it's not too hard on next gen, as the CPU AI actually misses quite a bit.  The most effective rebounding tactic I found was to PnR Worthy as the ball handler with the guy Kobe is guarding (Lillard).  Then back down Worthy under the basket and try and dunk.  You'll miss a lot, and you can snag a couple of boards that way.  Also, for this challenge, I scored only 2's until I got 8 rebounds, to increase the chances for boards.
3. This was my hardest challenge (see screenshot).  I did it by abusing the mechanic above, but this time with Steph Curry.  I backed him down with Worthy and basically missed, rebounded, missed, etc.  I ended up scoring enough that I had 11 boards within 18 points.  I know people recommend going into OT (keeping the score within 1) to get the assists, but I think on Next Gen you can get the boards this way.
4. Turn the Ball Over Once - very easy, just only shoot 3's.
5. 7 assists as a team - also very easy
6. 3 3's with Lillard and 100% - this is more of an expensive proposition.  I had a bunch of contracts, so I burned them.  I realize it's easier once Lillard gets sharp takeover, but I didn't want to wait for that every game, so - I just took the first 3 3's with Lillard, and if I missed, I quit.  Took me 11 games (I got it once, and lost in game 2) but I got really good with Lillard's shot in the process :).  \*Note - I know some people said you can make 1/1 3 with Lillard and the rest with other players, but that didn't work for me.  PS5, so results may vary.
7. 2 Blocks as a Team - this is another challenge where I only scored 2's.  The guy who ended up being easiest to block for me was Shaq, as long as I let him drive by Lillard and just jumped every time, mostly with Worthy.  You can off-ball with Worthy here since none of the C's will take 3 pointers unless its the end of the shot clock.  He took a bunch of those spin-around layups, and I got it in 5 games.
8. 2 Steals With Jimmy Butler - the last hard challenge, and honestly a bit of a crap shoot and a shit ton of luck.  Again, only score 2's on offense.  On defense, in addition to the normal smother settings, I switched Butler onto Blake Griffin.  Griffin has the worst ball-handling of the bunch.  I played about 12 games to get the steals, and in most games I had 1 inside of 15 points but couldn't get the second.  I spammed the steal button on Griffin as soon as he caught it.  Once I got 1 steal, I then fouled the shit of the CPU as often as possible in my end, and hoped for Butler to steal the ""inbound"" from the top of the key.  I actually had to play a game that ended 34-33.  If I didn't get the steal and they didn't score, I ran out of bounds on my end, and triggered a new inbounds play.  Finally got it.
9. Win by 10 - see above, very easy.
10. 11 assist - by now, if you've gotten this far, easy.
11. Defeat 3 Russells/No Turnovers - I mean, you know what to do.  I won this 21-6.

So I think there are 5 legit hard games on NextGen, but nothing impossible.  Current gen - I'm so sorry.

Hope this helps someone.

[],False,,Revenant_of_Null,1592340275.0,,qual,[],,Outstanding Contributor,dark,text,t2_6y2nyzmp,False,False,"Concerning your comment on the fuzziness of the term ""LGBT+ acts,"" and to further invite people (including u/ivan_bato) to appreciate the complexities of topic, I would suggest looking into the history of [sodomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy), i.e. to quote the Oxford English Dictionary:

&gt;a. Formerly: any form of sexual intercourse characterized as unnatural or immoral, or otherwise culturally stigmatized. Later: any of a number of forms of sexual intercourse other than heterosexual vaginal intercourse, esp. as legally defined (see note). Now chiefly: anal intercourse, esp. between men; (sometimes more generally) homosexual activity, homosexuality. Cf. buggery n.

Although sodomy is currently associated with what we call homosexuality^(1), the act of sodomy was (is) considered sinful or criminal regardless of sexual orientation. To quote [Pickett](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/):

&gt;Exactly what attitude the New Testament has towards sexuality in general, and same-sex attraction in particular, is a matter of sharp debate [...] **What is clear, however, is that while condemnation of same-sex attraction is marginal to the Gospels and only an intermittent focus in the rest of the New Testament, early Christian church fathers were much more outspoken.** In their writings **there is a horror at any sort of sex, but in a few generations these views eased,** in part due no doubt to practical concerns of recruiting converts. **By the fourth and fifth centuries the mainstream Christian view allowed only for procreative sex** [...]

&gt;**The latter part of the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries, however, saw a sharp rise in intolerance towards homosexual sex, alongside persecution of Jews, Muslims, heretics, and others.** While the causes of this are somewhat unclear, it is likely that increased class conflict alongside the Gregorian reform movement in the Catholic Church were two important factors. **The Church itself started to appeal to a conception of “nature” as the standard of morality, and drew it in such a way so as to forbid homosexual sex (as well as extramarital sex, nonprocreative sex within marriage, and often masturbation)** [...] **This appeal to natural law** (discussed below) **became very influential in the Western tradition.** An important point to note, however, is that **the key category here is the ‘sodomite,’ which differs from the contemporary idea of ‘homosexual’.** A sodomite was understood as **act-defined,** rather than as a type of person. Someone who had desires to engage in sodomy, yet did not act upon them, was not a sodomite. Also, persons who engaged in heterosexual sodomy were also sodomites. There are reports of persons being burned to death or beheaded for sodomy with a spouse (Greenberg, 1988, 277). Finally, a person who had engaged in sodomy, yet who had repented of his sin and vowed to never do it again, was no longer a sodomite. **The gender of one’s partner is again not of decisive importance, although some medieval theologians single out same-sex sodomy as the worst type of sexual crime** (Crompton, 2003, ch.6).

---

^(1) ^(There is a lot which can be said about the concept of homosexuality, and the conceptual categories employed by people throughout history. It is not straightforward. See for illustration Ancient Roman sexuality.)

---

We can also above the reasons provided to condemn particular sexual behaviors. In fact, see [sodomy laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_law) - which *de facto* criminalize homosexuality, and which [many can be traced back to colonialism and the British Empire.](https://theconversation.com/how-britains-colonial-legacy-still-affects-lgbt-politics-around-the-world-95799) The content of these laws are often preoccupied with what is ""natural"" (with particular sexual acts being deemed ""unnatural offences""). 

A brief tangent: exiting briefly Europe, see Japan's historical relationship with same-sex behavior (and the place of Western influence), and the Japanese Buddhist concept of *nanshouku*, i.e. male love. According to Hurteau (2013):

&gt;Belonging to the Mahayana tradition, **Japanese society before the Meiji era (1868–1912) demonstrated great tolerance vis-à-vis homosexual relations.** Meiji Restoration marked the end of Japanese isolation. **Its openness to the outside led to the adoption of an antisodomy law, for the first time in its history**, in section 226 of the *Kaitei Ritsurei (Amendments to the Criminal Code)* **in 1873.** **It was soon abolished in 1881, but the Western medical discourse on the “homosexual pervert” soon invested Japanese scientific and popular discourse.**  In the Taisho era (1912–1925), homosexual relations were labeled as *seiyoku hentai*, that is, diseases or abnormalities of the sexual desire. **The pre-Meiji history of male love** (***nanshoku***) **presented a decidedly different picture. The traditional discourse on** ***nanshoku*** **seemed to emerge mainly during the Muromachi era (1336–1573).** The love of boys was of sufficient importance in the daily lives of Japanese monasteries to the point where it gave rise to a particular literary genre called *Chigo Monogatari* (*Tales of acolytes*).

---

Considering that the ""L"" in ""LGBT+"" stands for *Lesbian*, it is also interesting to look into the history of lesbian sodomy, because same-sex behavior between *women* has historically been perceived differently, if not borderline invisible. According to Murray (1996):

&gt;**The possibility of women engaging in sexual activity without men did not attract much attention from later reformers, constrained as they were by their phallocentric worldview. Peter Damian,** who devoted a whole treatise to condemning male homosexuality, **did not mention lesbians in his Book of Gomorrah. Other participants in the Gregorian reforms contented themselves with repeating the condemnations of the older penitentials.** Similarly, the **great twelfth-century theologians did not add insights to the discourse, although condemnations of lesbian activity were repeated.** In his commentary on Romans, for example, Peter Abelard observed that nature had created women's genitals for the use of men. Even Hildegard of Bingen, who frequently brought new insights to her understanding of human sexuality, reinforced this traditional understanding of lesbians [...]

&gt;**Lesbian activity continued to be ignored, although gradually, by the thirteenth century, it was transumed under the broad category of sodomy, which came to include all manner of ""unnatural"" sexual activity, both heterosexual and homosexual.** Thus, in his *Summa theologiae*, in the discussion of lust, Thomas Aquinas considered four categories of unnatural acts. These included masturbation, bestiality, intercourse in unnatural positions, and both male and female homosexuality. **This development rendered lesbian activity even more invisible, while at the same time it acquired the more serious overtones associated with sodomy. In general, however, lesbian activity continued to be minimalized and marginalized by both theologians and canonists.**

To quote [Jordåen](https://skeivtarkiv.no/en/skeivopedia/sodomy-between-women) from a Norwegian perspective:

&gt;**Sodomy, or fornication against nature,** was until the late 19th century considered a wide category of forbidden (and sinful) sexual acts. **In theory this category could include most sexual acts apart from reproductive sexuality between a man and a woman.** In this respect **it could also encompass sexual acts between men and women which deviated from this, and also sexuality between women.**

&gt;**In Europe it was nonetheless rare that relationships between women were included in the laws against sodomy**, though it was included in the text of the sodomy ban in one of the most influential law texts of the time, the Penal Code for the Germanic-Roman Empire from 1533, *Constitutio Criminalis Carolina*.

And Roelens (2015) argues, in his study of the legal history of Netherlands:

&gt;The notion that sodomy was solely a male crime was part of a long intellectual tradition. **Most pre-modern sources concerning the subject exhibit a phallocentric understanding of human sexuality,** which means that sex was comprehended only in terms of actual penetration. **Women were considered to be incapable of having sex with one another without the active participation of a male or the use of artificial devices.** While certain medieval medical writers pointed out that women could develop fleshly growths outside the vagina that could be used as a penis to have sexual intercourse with other women, this sexual irregularity was usually only attributed to exotic women from other continents. Then, **after the sixteenth century anatomical ‘rediscovery of the clitoris’, fears arose that European women were also able to penetrate other women. Prior to this however, the possibility that female sodomy could actually occur was not taken very seriously and therefore did not attract much attention from pre-modern lawmakers and theologians.**

&gt;Fraser Gehrig wasn’t called the G-Train because he was shrinking violet.

&gt;He hated key defenders because they were annoying and, he thought, too often played the game outside the rules. Like, pushing, blocking and holding.

&gt;Gehrig, it would seem, had the same disdain for the one-time bully boys at Triple M.

&gt;The blokey radio station was notorious for ridiculing others to pump up their gags and, when accusations of being bullies were levelled at them, they were often swiped away as being a bit of fun.

&gt;[Fraser Gehrig was no fan of the Triple M commentary crew during his playing career.](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/958a5afb3c8de696ccc13c3056918538)

&gt;Of course, someone’s fun can be someone else’s torment.

&gt;Mental health wasn’t as big a public issue then, even though several members of the Triple M team had and have endured their own battles with depression.

&gt;The question which always hung in the air was: Why did they regularly put down others which can cause mental distress when they were dealing with their own mental health issues?

&gt;Yes, it’s a serious question.

&gt;Gehrig, at the weekend, took Triple M to task, in particular star frontmen Garry Lyon and James Brayshaw, for contributing to the mental distress of players.

&gt;In a brutally honest interview — on Triple M of all places — which seemed to leave the on-air cast reeling, Gehrig was asked by a playful Damian Barrett if he remembered a night when he exchanged words with Brayshaw and Lyon at a St Kilda hotel.

&gt;[Gehrig took aim at Triple M, naming departed caller Garry Lyon and James Brayshaw.](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9ff5da31310fd31e9e08697bbb53ce0c)

&gt;The expected playfulness in return was instead met by a serious retort from Gehrig which centred on mental health.

&gt;“To be honest I’ve never been a fan of the media,” Gehrig said.

&gt;“I was the type of player that played. I didn’t like the publicity and I probably still don’t.

&gt;“I’m doing some today (a radio interview) for Deliveroo because they’re giving some money to charity. So that’s what I’m about.

&gt;“Triple M, to be honest, in their heyday, and I’m not trying to be rude saying this, when you did your 3-2-1 worst players on ground, it had an effect on things like depression.

&gt;“And a lot of the guys who were doing those calls have had depression in their lives – and I don’t think it helped.

&gt;[Gehrig hammed it up with fans at the footy on Friday night. Picture: AFL Photos/Getty Images](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/526259f31e9ae02d471ee15c47522b15)

&gt;“Brayshaw, Lyon and these sorts of blokes, at the time I thought, ‘go get stuffed’.

&gt;“You know, they’ve had a few beers and they want to come up and try to be heroes and I told them (where to go). So I’ll stand by that.

&gt;“I couldn’t care less, to be honest. Again, I don’t want to be rude and turn something into something that it’s not but we’ve seen depression over the years get bigger and bigger – and we’ve all had it.

&gt;“Probably everyone in this room has had it and those sorts of things (the worst player votes) don’t help. I haven’t listened to Triple M for a long time but I hope you don’t do it (anymore).”

&gt;[Garry Lyon and James Brayshaw during their time on the Footy Show.](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/66ffcdb656b8e71eadb65030166ff9dd)

&gt;Collectively, the on aircrew answered an enthusiastic, “yes, yes, yes”.

&gt;Brayshaw’s recollection of the night in St Kilda was equally as playful.

&gt;“Gaz and I made the very poor decision to go to one more joint, rather than go home,” Brayshaw said.

&gt;“And we happened to run into the St Kilda boys … and suddenly the oxygen has gone out of the room a bit and the blokes I had around me talking to me seemed to have gone somewhere else.

&gt;“And I was left alone with big Fraser … and he wasn’t seeing the humorous side of anything we were going with on-air that season.

&gt;“And I was trying to explain to him that all that came from (Sam Newman) and I’d had nothing to do with it.

&gt;“And he was saying, ‘we can make this easy or hard. I can just take you outside and snap you in half – how does that sound’?”

&gt;It sounded like Gehrig wanted the Triple M crew to understand the consequence of blokey behaviour.

A Solomons seal could describe the seals of the goetic spirits or the seals of the planatory talismans in the lesser/greater keys or Solomon. A Solomons seal is also a protective amulet one would wear when evoking the goetic spirits. Both these things are reserved for Adepts (People who have studied magick for years) for good reason. Rush into it and you will be burned. Stay the fuck away from evocation you can accomplish low magick without dragging a spirit from the void (And potentially making a powerful enemy) 

When I first started magick I rushed right into solomonic magick and realised very quickly that creating talismans are difficult. It's really something an intermediate or an adept would be doing because you really have to concentrate on the flow of energy that vivifys the talisman (Brings to life) and when you're a beginner your astral senses are poor at best so you cant really let the energy flow

If you wanna do some magick I recommend the following books 

72 angels of magick - Damon brand 

This book is special because it's straight of of the box manifestation which let's face it is exactly what you're looking for. It's low magick which means it's all about making your physical life more comfortable. Damon brand has many many books that are about low magick and if your smart you can find every one of them for free  **Edit: Buy at least one. They are hexed so that If you steal them you won't learn from them**

High magick 
And/or Archangels and angels of magick - Damian echols 

These are the two best books I've found for getting into High magick. High magick is the evolution of low magick where the goal is to use your own magickal power to enhance your spiritual understanding instead of physical pleasure. This is magick that you do routinely over a long period of time that drasticly changes you for the better. If you're serious about magick this is the serious path where one becomes an adept. It is basically the western equivalent of Buddhism 

If a more hermetic (Solomonic) approach is more your style Franz Bardons initiation into hermetics is second to none. This was a guy who could heal people with his bare hands, stop people in their tracks with kabbalistic wordings and was literally tortured by Adolf Hitler into spilling his magickal teachings (Which he didn't) 

Again.  I do not recommend evocation (Because you can get everything you want out of it via Damon without the risk) but if you're interested in it and want to learn more about it Lon Milo Duquette is a Solomonic sorcerer with some great books on the subject

**Beliefs Instincts and Traits for the Raven King.**   
I need to create three Beliefs for an NPC that will challenge my players in our next session.   
Character Concept: the defeated elf king of the valley that is now Barovia. He has summoned the heroes to his court in exile called, Shadow Fall where everything is a Red and Pleasant Land.   
He sent his raven messenger to Marama the half-elven hermit Druid with the message, “the Raven King seeks an audience, Breaker of the world.” That night Marama went on the mushroom trip and he realized that he is immutable, formless, all things (basically shape change on steroids spiritual dream trip) but tied to this valley. He casts Speak with Plants and they whisper back to find his destiny to the north through the mists. He then shape changed into a raven (a new ability) and flew North through the mists to meet the Raven King on his own. He choked out and fell to the ground almost dying. The messenger bird came back and laughed at him saying, “you are a fool for trying to cross the mists without the Song of Paths and Ways.” Later, after the battle of the Ritual of Awakening, when Baba Yaga attempted to awaken Strahd from his hibernation, Marama stole a magic green gem/focalising crystal from Baba Yaga and returned it to these corrupted fae spirits that were bound to a sacred grove in the Martikov Vineyard. This henge looked exactly like the grove where he grew up in Faerun.   


**Marama’s Beliefs:**   
1. I will continue to seek the Raven King at all costs and from him (and only him) learn the truth about Strahd  
2. I will continue to pursue the mystery of my origins above all else as this land seems to hold the key  
3. I will deepen my connection to the cosmic magic I sensed on my mushroom trip and ultimately learn to travel to and navigate other planes of reality. The links of time and the evidence of our previous existence in this land holds to key to this knowledge  
  
**Belief Work for the Raven King**  
I need to come up with three Beliefs that will embody the Raven King. I definitely need to use one to challenge all the story ammunition that Trevor gave me with Marama.   
So who is he? The NPC as written is supposed to be an ally, the wereraven patriarch of the Martikov vintners, Damian Martikov. It read: Find the Leader of the Feathered Ones who live among the vines. Though old he has one more fight left in him.   
I didn’t like the idea of a wereraven faction in Barovia, so I created a new character to challenge the players. The Raven King. The party has Deified him and are desperate for a benefactor in this harrowing adventure. They want answers to the mystery. But he is old and in hiding. Maybe not so heroic. 

  
How do I create an NPC that will mess with the Marama’s beliefs? 

  
**Marama Belief 1**. I will continue to seek the Raven King at all costs and from him (and only him) learn the truth about Strahd. 

This belief implies that there are several truths and that the Raven’s King’s conclusions about Strahd might not be in the party’s interest. “at all costs” telegraphs to me a level of blind conviction that Trevor wants to see at the table. 

His beloved ancestral Elven Kingdom was finally swept up into the mists when Tatyanna cursed Strahd when she learned that he killed his brother, her lover and wanted to rape her. She invoked the Curse of the Dark Powers (who I see could be like the Norns) and damned Strahd to relive his horrible Fate of loss for all of eternity. The Raven King believes:   

  
1.	You are trapped and you will never get out of this nightmare world because of your companion, Nora the priestess of Lathlander is Tatyanna, a spirit creature in human form that cursed Strahd to relive his for eternity. The power of her curse caused a rip in the fabric of space and time and our land has been locked in the endless loop for hundreds of years. To end the loop and allow the curse to be lifted, not only must Strahd die, but so must your friend.

  
This neatly draws in the player running **Nora the Party Cleric,** whose belief 3rd reads: 

  
**Nora Belief 3**. Seeing our possible future selves and my golem abomination (a fallen angle and created a golem that looked exactly like her to gift to Strahd) are a warning that each of us could be lured to darker paths, which would endanger our souls and the chance to save the people of this valley.” 

  
She could easily invoke this belief to argue that Marama is going nuts and needs to be stopped. The Raven King’s lies must be stopped. Also, in an earlier scenario, the players battled future skeletal replicas of themselves further compounding on the ground hog day vibe of this campaign. 

  
Marama’s descent into lunacy (he is a moon druid afterall) is also a theme in **Eldarion the Wizard’s Beliefs:** 

  
Eldarion Belief 2) Marama has had a challenging past and may be a damaged soul. We may need to watch him closely to make sure his personal search for understanding and belonging doesn't jeopardize the quest.  

  
 This also touches on Marama’s second belief. 

  
**Marama Belief 2**. I will continue to pursue the mystery of my origins above all else as this land seems to hold the key

&gt;Elle- Kitty **she has the looks, but idk if i'd trust her to belt out the end of so much better. i'd honestly prefer putting rachel here and plopping a blonde wig on her because i think her voice matches well. (plus then you have good chemistry between elle and emmett)**

&gt;Emmett- Finn **i'm good with this.**   
&gt;  
&gt;Vivienne- Rachel **i'd put santana**

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Pilar- Santana **maybe mercedes and take her off of enid? idk**  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle- Sam **yeah i really don't know because i like him as warner and kyle**

I think this is funny because I was debating making a post casting them in Legally Blonde the other day (it's one of my fav musicals not gonna lie, so underrated). I wanted to respond to these individually so my responses are bolded in the quote.

My view as a *user* of Raku, a PL that supports [many chained operators](https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#:~:text=!=%20%E2%89%A0%20==%20%3C%20%3C=%20%E2%89%A4%20%3E%20%3E=%20%E2%89%A5%20eq%20ne%20lt%20le%20gt%20ge%20~~%20===%20eqv%20!eqv%20=~=%20%E2%89%85%20(elem)%20(cont)%20(%3C)%20(%3E)%20(%3C=)%20(%3E=)%20(%3C+)%20(%3E+)%20(==)%20%E2%88%88%20%E2%88%89%20%E2%88%8B%20%E2%88%8C%20%E2%89%A1%20%E2%89%A2%20%E2%8A%82%20%E2%8A%84%20%E2%8A%83%20%E2%8A%85%20%E2%8A%86%20%E2%8A%88%20%E2%8A%87%20%E2%8A%89%20%E2%89%BC%20%E2%89%BD), is that I find it natural to write and read chained expressions. Sometimes issues with various PL features can emerge over the long haul, but after reading and writing Raku code for a decade I'm not aware of any problem with chained expressions, as a user.

My view as an *observer* of Raku's design and implementation of chaining operator support is that it can be done cleanly, and can even be extended to user defined operators. Thus in Raku one can just add `is equiv&lt;op&gt; is assoc&lt;chain&gt;` to the declaration of a user defined infix op to make it so.

ThomasMertes claims elsewhere that support for chaining necessarily means ad hoc parsing. Rakoons aren't above ad hoc coding**^(1)**, but Raku's design and implementation of chaining isn't ad hoc.**^(2)**

\----

**^(1)** For example, Raku's standard GPL includes a ternary operator. But the grammar pretends it's a binary op! This pretence is done with just a few lines of clean code. [Clean, but definitely ad hoc](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/kro7li/lessons_learned_over_the_years/gj16zk6/?context=999). The overall parser is entirely unaware of this because the code scrupulously follows the rules of Raku's formal grammar construct. But its ad hoc nature directly results in users being unable to *easily* create user defined *ternary* operators in Raku's GPL, the sort of thing that Thomas is right about.

**^(2)** In [a recent exchange Thomas and I had about this very issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/n43ct2/how_many_forms_of_associativity/gwyutt8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I responded to some key elements of his argument. The core of it seemed to me to be argument from authority, while ignoring any other authority.**^(3,4)** As evidence for his position, he noted that his PL could support user-defined statements because it avoided the hack that he supposed Raku must have incorporated. But Raku supports user-defined statements as well.

**^(3)** Jeffrey Kegler, creator of the world class [Marpa](http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/) parser, mentions [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) in his [Parsing Timeline](https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3) \-- alongside parsing notables Pannini, Kleene, Chomsky, Backus, Dijkstra, Knuth, Earley, Pratt, and Wadler.

**Today’s Pick(s):**

**Washington Wizards -3.5  (-110)(1u)** at Indiana Pacers

**Player Performance Double: Russel Westbrook Triple-Double / Washington to Win (+110)(.5u)**

Indiana ended a long profitable streak the other day in which I faded them at home for 13 games straight. They are still the 2nd worst ATS home team in NBA history and I see no reason why that should change against a surging Wizards team. Regarding the Brodie prop, he once again is a walking triple double and I expect Washington to win this one pretty convincingly.

Brooklyn Nets at **Denver Nuggets +4 (-110)(1u)**

Denver continues to assert their dominance in the Western Conference. Brooklyn is now on a 4 game skid and while I do see some matchup issues present, I still like the Mile High team in this spot. Denver contests shots well enough to prevent Kyrie from reaching too far into his bag. And MPJ is plenty capable of containing KD, he may not completely stop him, but he can contain him. It should be very fun watching Jokic post up on the key and slowly start to pick apart their defense, something subpar offenses also manage to do, so it should be entertaining to see what the soon to be MVP can do. Take the small number on a consistent Denver team.

Houston Rockets at **Utah Jazz 1H -8.5 (-110)(1u)**

I will continue to fade very bad teams in the first half, even if this very Rockets team covered yesterday. The Utah Jazz offense is just too potent to be contained, especially by this sad sack of excuses for a defense.

OKC Thunder at **GS Warriors 1H -8.5 (-110)(1u)**

I had this exact pick a few games ago and it hit. Again, I will continue to fade bad teams in the first half.

**3 Leg Parlay (+444)(.5u)**

**Washington Wizards ML (-162)** at Indiana Pacers

Then the ads come out of nowhere and will blow your speakers out. Be ready.

2) both the host and Isreal Keyes and the cops interviewing him do this horrible fake laugh thing all the freaking time. Makes me grit my teeth.

3) the host has the WORST taste in music, and plays way too much of it and is way too proud of it. Damian Hellfire, I hate you.

4) it can get very repetitive, like he'll reiterate using the same turn of phrase often enough that Im like ""wait i listened to this already"" BUT NO, I didn't, hes just repeating himself to tie back into something from 4 episodes or 2 seasons ago

5) too much effort put into trying to make you feel suspense and drama. The truth is dramatic enough, I do not need you to only say one word every 10 seconds to enhance it

6) the host can't figure out how to say some pretty common words, he might be a lizard person from mars or something.  Like the 3rd season he has to say ""iron"" really frequently, and he always says it like 'eye - ron'  its just goofy as hell.

Apart from the first one, I don’t know how unpopular these opinions are, but they’re mine.

* I have practically zero interest in the Batfamily besides Batman, Alfred, and Batgirl. Especially Jason Todd, but especially that little prick Damian.
* The redesign of Batgirl where they gave her a leather jacket and turned her into a selfie-taking hipster club kid was shite. Rant incoming. They gave her a satchel, for Christ’s sake. Why not just wind the clock all the way back to the Sixties and give her a handbag? Far from empowering women (“leather jacket - NOT spandex!”) this infantilised her, and put her in a box: “You stay over here at the children’s table, Barbara. You don’t get to have a real superhero costume. You’re a fashion doll for little girls.” It was so fucking sexist I can’t believe it was dreamt up by a woman.
* Scott Snyder’s Joker was the worst thing about his run on Batman. As is the case with a lot of recent portrayals of the character, he’s not funny: he’s just a sick fuck. And when he does have jokes, they’re too convoluted to be funny. Remember that bit in Mad Love where Joker says to Harley that if you have to explain the joke, there is no joke? That.
* Speaking of Harley, every stripperiffic redesign they’ve ever given her has sucked. Can we have the original harlequin costume back, please?
* While the story is excellent, the art in Knightfall was crap. I still have nightmares of Bane’s big hairy shoulders. What I wouldn’t give for a remake by an all-star lineup of artists. Imagine Jim Lee, Greg Capullo and Lee Bermejo tackling key moments in that storyline.

Is it potentially a matter of time, or should I enlist a PR firm with possible connections to help? Do you think there's a certain fanbase threshold you should try to reach on your own before seeking external marketing?  
&gt;  
&gt;If any of you happen to come back, I'd really appreciate an answer to this!

Thats a great question! Getting your music heard is very difficult when starting out, it was for us too! I started playing with the Asger and Martin in 2009, and it wasn’t until 2016 that we started working with labels/PR companies/management and booking.

I think if you have a great story, then a PR company could be worth the investment early on, but the truth is that most newer bands haven’t really build an identity yet, and that will make it a lot harder for a PR company to help you.

Also I have found that the more we can do ourselves PR, booking and vice versa, the stronger your position will be when you start working with labels/bookers/PR and so on. 

I know it can be a frustrating period, but if you find enjoyment in all these small steps a band needs to take, it can be a fun ride:)

I keep papers, school schedules &amp; notes all stored inside. This clipboard has been essential to my life. Here’s the one I got from target (was VERY cute) https://www.target.com/p/8-5-34-x-11-34-clipfolio-dots-stripes-greenroom/-/A-15022445
I only use the notepad paper for the teachers note at the end of the day. I buy the refills at target once the notepad paper is gone. Regular binder paper is for anything else. 

Many teachers do NOT provide a seating chart &amp; this has been crucial for my classes. If you do not have one, create a quick box with lines displaying where all the desks are. It should take 30 seconds to create, no names are needed at all, just boxes. If students are not listening or giving you a hard time, make a tally in their box. Add more tallies for more misbehaviors. This will show you were troublesome students sit &amp; you can walk around &amp; fill in the boxes with names of those who are either giving you a hard time or those who are going above and beyond in their work. Make heart shapes or O’s or any quick mark in the seating chart for those students. Once you have a students name, it’s easier to address them &amp; make them change their behaviors. If they improve, remove tallies. Let them know that anyone with tallies remaining by the end of the day will be reported to the teacher. “Damian, Sarah &amp; Michael, you guys are still on my list”. Make sure to list off the above-&amp;-beyond kids out loud so that others will try to get on that good list. Creating a makeshift seating chart is ESSENTIAL. &amp; again, don’t worry about collecting names until after you’ve settled into the classroom &amp; have time to roam around.  

Bring a toy! (Once everything is more back to normal &amp; hygiene isn’t as strict). This has been useful for all age groups. I bring a lil penguin that has a slight weight to it so that it is easier to throw. It’s great for questions or as a reward at the end of the day. It’s also easy to throw in the washer to clean. 

Bring a lanyard for the room key. A majority of schools provide this, but I’ve lost a key at the one school that did not provide this. It was NOT a fun day (until we finally found it). 

It’s also okay if you don’t understand the material sometimes. If I encounter something that I’m unsure of, I’ll let the kids know &amp; ask one of them if maybe they know how to approach the issue. Have them either explain it to the class or explain it to you. Just try to solve/ work it out with them together if possible. In a dire situation, send out a student who knows of a teacher who can help you. Write the problem down on a piece of paper &amp; hopefully they have time to answer your question (I had one math class that really messed me up). *You don’t have to know everything, you just need to know how to find solutions to solve your problems.*

You are not alone! If a student is just being unruly, write a quick note &amp; send them to the office. Take a moment to pause class (this can be difficult), &amp; call the office to explain why they are being sent out. Make sure to locate the school directory within your classroom as soon as you walk in in the morning. Neighboring teachers are also very helpful! Ask them if it’s okay for you to send them a few students who may potentially give you a hard time. You may never send a student over, but just in case. Write a note for them to return in say 15 minutes, or the entire period.

If any child leaves the presence of your classroom, make sure you write their name down, what time they left &amp; where. If someone is gone for more than 15 minutes, make sure you mention it to the teacher AND call the office to report them as missing. Security will find them &amp; return them to you. If they leave without notifying you of where they’re going, write their names down immediately for the teacher &amp; call the office if they don’t return in 5 minutes. 

Half days are very easy. ENJOY the brief time with the kiddos. Smile often, joke around, &amp; just try to be as helpful as possible to every student. Walk around &amp; ask every single one if they’re doing okay. Some will say they’re fine, but they are far behind the others. “I know you’re fine, but I want to work on a few of these questions with you”. Most accept this request, a few will refuse. If they refuse, “okay that’s fine, but I’ll check back in a few minutes to see what you’ve done”. 

They’re human, you’re human, it’s okay to make mistakes. Just try to improve with each day &amp; be open to learning. In middle school/high school, my first periods are basically guinea pigs where I make the most mistakes. Make this clear in the sub not  &amp; that you improved the session for the other classes!

Livestock production requires large quantities of harvested feed. It takes seven pounds of feed to produce a pound of Beef. Raising animals for human consumption accounts for approximately 40% of the total amount of agricultural output.

It accounts for similar percentage of farmland. In addition(!), grazing areas for cattle account for about 25% of the world’s ice-free land. Grazing cattle alone accounts for more than 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions [8]. 

Meat production is considered a major driver of climate change. [10] According to a 2018 study in the journal Nature, a significant reduction in meat consumption will be ""essential"" to mitigate climate change, especially as the human population increases by a projected 2.3 billion by the middle of the century.[11]

[],False,,trufflesmeow,1455660232.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_v5p57,False,False,"Former transport secretary Lord Andrew Adonis has slammed the government for an apparent lack of commitment to the eastern leg of High Speed 2 (HS2).

Lord Adonis labelled the government’s response to the eastern leg as “pathetic” in a tweet, after a group of 16 former cabinet ministers wrote to prime minister Boris Johnson stressing the importance of committing to the full HS2 route.

Adonis tweet said: “Letter to me just received from Johnson’s HS2 minister refusing to commit to building HS2 to Derby, Nottingham, Sheffield &amp; Leeds.

“An absolutely pathetic letter So much for levelling up!”

Fears that the eastern leg of HS2 to Leeds could be mothballed have been growing in recent months, after the DfT announced plans to split the phase 2b bill in two, separating legislation needed to build the western and eastern legs.

Those fears were exacerbated by recommendations made by the NIC's Rail needs assessment which recommended prioritising the western leg of phase 2b to Manchester.

In the letter to Johnson - seen by NCE - the group of former cabinet ministers said that investing in the full HS2 route was key to “our country’s future”. (See below for full list of signatories.)

“Infrastructure investment is a tried and tested way of supporting economic revival, and despite the difficult financial decisions that lie ahead, we write to you to urge that Government delivers the HS2 network, in full, including the Eastern Leg of Phase 2b from Birmingham to Toton in Nottinghamshire, Chesterfield/Staveley, Sheffield and Leeds, extending north to Scotland,” the letter states.

“Communities along HS2’s Eastern Leg suffer from lower productivity, receive less transport investment and are home to more social deprivation cold spots, not only compared to the UK average, but also in comparison to communities along HS2’s Western Leg, from Birmingham to Manchester.

“Now is not the time to delay or scale back plans to invest, to do so now, would lose the trust of millions of people in these historically left behind communities.

“This decision is Government’s levelling-up litmus test – a commitment to levelling up must be mirrored by a final commitment to delivering HS2 in full.”

In response, dedicated minister for HS2 Andrew Stephenson said that the DfT is “carefully considering the evidence from all stakeholders and the recommendations in the National Infrastructure Commission’s report ahead of making final decisions on the Integrated Rail Plan, which we intend to publish later this Spring”.

The Integrated Rail Plan will set out how major projects such as HS2, Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Engine will be phased and connected.

It was due to be published “early” this year, but has been delayed due to local election purdah rules.

A DfT spokesperson added: “We are committed to delivering the benefits of high speed rail to passengers and communities in the North and Midlands.

“Our Integrated Rail Plan will set out how projects, including HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail, can work together to deliver the reliable train services that passengers need and deserve, as quickly as possible.”

Let's look at the teams:

Tres Horny Boys:
All out offense. Think Warriors brand of basketball. You have Merle bringing the ball upcourt, and while his shot may not be lethal I can still see him being a solid 35% 3 point shooter when he has space, considering he isn't really going to be shooting over anyone. Also gives me Mugsy Bouges vibes, he will nutmeg you on the way to the hoop. Then you have the knockdown shooter, Taako. Absolute ice in his veins when he has a good look from any distance. I really only see him as a catch a shoot kinda guy though, and I doubt he participates at all on defense. But that is likely made up by Magnus. Huge body that can gaurd 1-5 and isn't afraid to go one on one with the best player on the opposite team. Think Draymond here. He definitely has his moments where he plays dirty and will take multiple techs during the course of the matches, but if he can avoid a game suspension he will likely be the best defender on the court period. Only scores by dunking. 

The Pine Gaurd:
Bringing the ball upcourt we have the chosen one himself, Duck Newton. This is this teams Damian Lillard. Most clutch shooter in the tournament, almost like he is destined for greatness. He is also one of those guys that is first one in to practice and last one out. Great leader all around. Aubry Little comes in to be CJ to Duck's Dame. Her shots and moves don't look as flashy, but she plays with ferocity and is a tireless competitor. Not afraid to take contact on a driving layup but can also switch it up and pull out a turnaround fader from 15-ft at a moments notice. Ned is straight out of the Bad Boy Pistons. He's dirty. He will bend the rules almost every defensive position and will argue that hand checking is legal in this street-ball style tournament. Also a huge flopper. You'll see it all, calling for a hack on a layup, KD's rip-through, and adjusting his jumper so that he lands on your feet to get a flagrant. No one wants to gaurd or be guarded by Ned.

The Thundermen:
This one is the hardest honestly. I think a crafty playmaker like Argo should be the ball handler here, but I feel like Fitzroy takes the duties of playcalling for this team. For better or for worse, Fitzroy's playbook here has some wild plays. I think one of them involved the Firbolg coming up to the top of the key and setting a screen on.... Argo? Who then falls down and causes a distraction hoping that Fitzroy then has a clear lane to the hoop for an easy layup. It is wacky and a great display when it works, but in a 7 game series I dont know how it holds up. Their team is solid defensively however. With each member having a defined roll. Fitzroy matches up on the best scorer and talks smack the entire time, along with more distractions from the sideline with Snippers singing along. Argo can switch on anything and with Fitz's help of a haste spell would be an unstoppable perimeter defender. Then you have Rudy ""Master Firbolg"" Gobert in the paint. It's a block party when he is in town. And the finger wag? Oh he's got the finger wag. ""No no no ☝ not today""

So who wins?

Well like I said I don't think the game plan from Fitzroy is sustainable longterm as teams have time to gameplan around the shenanigans. So even if they made a surprise upset against one team I dont think they could then turn around and beat either of the others. So between the Pine Gaurd and Tres Horny Boys? It really is a question of great team offense vs great team defense. I think these teams match up very well and while the THB can score almost at will, the rough style of defense from The Pine Gaurd slow it down a bit. Then you have Taako, the absolute liability on defense. At least one member of the Pine Gaurd will be open almost every possession. 

For these reasons I think the Pine Gaurd actually pull this one out with MVP going to Duck Newton for his incredible, half-court buzzer beater to ice the game.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1618361247.0,,1618361557.0,0.0,{},gufonm6,False,t3_mq24zl,False,t1_gufonm6,False,t3_mq24zl,/r/TheAdventureZone/comments/mq24zl/since_its_the_offweek_how_about_a_freeforall/gufonm6/,,6.0,False,True,False,TheAdventureZone,t5_35q2i,,public,,0.0,[],,False,1628312442.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,,Zestyclose_Usual_644,1618310296.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_bie4jlzf,False,False,"So I’m watching Raw last night didn’t watch all of it... and The Viking Raiders come out and it’s ok to see them but they could’ve done a thousand times better on Raw for the “big surprise” than the Viking Raiders at that point I knew this Raw was gonna suck overall so I just turned off the tv and went to sleep

I wake up this morning and find loads of bs in each and every segment and match of the night Im glad I went to sleep instead 

First we have the Riddle vs Bobby Lashley match at this point I was still watching. As much as I love Riddle I knew this was gonna be a squash match and so it was now the problem here is terrible character development for Riddle and WWE trying to put Lashley over me personally I’m not a very big Lashley fan he’s just another revamped Brock Lesnar that only has a couple of moves and destroys everything in sight (Roman Reigns) they could honestly put boots on Riddle get rid of the stoner personality, take away the scooter, and make him a heel and he would take it and ride with it and just make WWE a lot better but no we have to focus on the bigger guys of the company like Roman and Lashley both of them have terrible mic skills and wrestling that’s made out for them to look like no one can beat them which is fine to a certain point until you get the Hulk Hogan treatment if you know what I mean 

Viking Raiders returns against Cedric and Shelton 
I had one problem with this match what in the world are they doing with Cedric and Shelton now knowing WWE they have already been part of a big storyline so they don’t need them anymore two things will either happen 1. Turn them into entertainment talent 2. Keep them as Jobbers until both of their contracts are done then write them off tv 

Then Charlotte comes out...
Don’t get me wrong I love Charlotte but I think WWE has to take a few steps back from Charlotte so a select few in the women’s division on Raw can get a chance at the title someone like Nikki Cross or even give Alexa Bliss a title run with her new gimmick we have already seen Charlotte vs Rhea Ripley so give us something new

That leads me onto the match between Asuka and Ripley 
Match was great both showed of their talent but we didn’t need a rematch what is the deal with Wrestlemania rematches on Raw the night after Mania save it till Backlash if you have to but don’t make it Raw 

There are two human beings on Raw who actually leaves me hanging every weekend and want to see more of them and those beings are Bray Wyatt and Alexa Bliss both have tremendous mic skills amazing character and personality and great at working in the ring but I have one teeny tiny problem they overkill it with the damn cliffhangers at the end of the segments and matches for example last night I wanna know why in the hell Alexa Bliss was on top of the box “bleeding” on Sunday night I don’t think the answer “The Fiend left me for awhile”
doesn’t cut it I believe that they are trying to do something so much bigger and deeper in the storyline and that’s ok Bc I think it could work but pls don’t overkill it with the cliffhangers

The Miz and Morrison are getting some very unfair treatment by the writers and backstage personnel in my opinion why in the hell is the Miz getting a upset victory over Damian Priest.. The Miz is better talent than Damian Preist will ever know so is Morrison hell I’ve always thought Morrison was the better of the two they never could figure out what to do with Morrison in the wwe which I call BS I’m not saying you have to make him WWE Champion or Universal I just want to see him as one of the guys that excels in the mid card division like with Ziggler, Otis, and Rey Mysterio there was just so much wrong with the match it would take a long ass paragraph to explain everything wrong with this story and the match so I’m just gonna stop it right there 

All I got to say for the Women’s Tag Division is it just sucks stories don’t make sense they just find two women who are willing to take on Shrek and Fiona ( Jax and Baszler) and that’s your match and it’s garbage wrestling and storytelling I dont even think it’s worthy enough to be called storytelling 

There was one match that I did find no problems with and that was The New Day vs Elias &amp; Ryker it was just a match to put over the New Day and I have no problem with it Bc I love the new day they never get old to me and the way they approach the fans and how they wrestle in the ring is something very few tag teams has accomplished (DX) 

Ok finally now for the main event 
There was no need for this match we already knew it was gonna be McIntyre and Lashley at backlash key words Back and Lash but it was cool to see three of the best on Raw go at it which was Orton, Strowman, and McIntyre so McIntyre won but that wasn’t the issue is when the damn shield knock offs Retribution came out and attacked him while Most Valuable Prick was talking to McIntyre I just didn’t care for the whole Hurt Business and Retribution storyline I really didn’t care for either team it was like seeing the Original authority team vs The Shield all over again before the shield broke up and Seth went to the authority it’s the same storyline Team A breaks up then some members of Team A joins Team B

Overall this was the worst Raw after Mania and left me very disappointed with WWE

Once the Timmverse sort of ground to a halt (starting with Batman: The Animated Series and ending with Justice League Unlimited), all the direct-to-video features have sort of existed in a non-continuity state. The same goes for Young Justice and the various Teen Titans features.

You can sort of order them according to how the Bat-family grows and changes (with the appearance of Damian, Cassandra Cain, the return of Jason, etc), but even those direct-to-video pieces aren't really consistent  with each other in art style or voices or exactly where they appear in some timeline.

The only exceptions I can think of...

* Flashpoint, Justice League Dark, and Justice League Dark: Apokolips War seem to occur in the same continuity, as events in JLD &amp; JLD:AW explicitly call back to Flashpoint.
* Superman/Batman: Public Enemies and Superman/Batman: Apocalypse take place one right after the other, although the art style is quite different from the Timmverse they brought back key voice talent: Tim Daly, Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg as the Trinity, and even Ed Asner as Granny Goodness!
* Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker is firmly in the Batman Beyond continuity &amp; has same voice talent as the original BB (incl. return of Mark Hamill)
* Justice League vs. The Fatal Five *might* be in the original Justice League continuity? They brought back George Newbern as Superman, and Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg, and the art style is VERY consistent with the old Justice League episodes. Also the Fatal Five were characters in a Justice League episode and are mostly the same here.

##**Finn Balor vs Karrion Kross for the *NXT Championship*.**

Karrion Kross declared when he was forced to vacate the NXT Championship that he would come for it once he had healed. Kross was forced to bide his time upon his return, settling issues with Damian Priest and Santos Escobar, but his sights are firmly set on the NXT Championship. After Finn Balor defeated Adam Cole on an episode of NXT, Kross appeared and made it clear he was coming for the title. While the two did team for a NXT Tag Team Championship match against Danny Burch and Oney Lorcan, the two men have kept their distance from one another, preferring to save it for the ring. 

**Key Factor**: Karrion Kross has yet to taste defeat, but he's coming up against a Finn Balor at the top of his game. The presence of Scarlett at ringside could prove the difference maker for Karrion Kross. 

##**Adam Cole vs Kyle O'Reilly - Unsanctioned Match**

Two men who have systematically failed to save it for the ring are Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly. After O'Reilly failed to capture the NXT Championship at TakeOver: Vengeance Day, Cole would turn on his former friend, delivering a superkick. The following week on NXT, Cole would again attack O'Reilly, delivering a suplex to the steel stairs that rendered O'Reilly medically unfit to compete. To get his hands on Cole, Finn Balor would offer Cole a NXT Championship match, only to have an uncleared O'Reilly return and attack Cole. Subsequent to this, the two got in a brawl that resulted in police arresting both men, and another brawl at O'Reilly's gym. With the two men leading to further and further problems for William Regal, he forced the two men to fight in an Unsanctioned match, leaving NXT not liable for whatever happens to them. 

**Key factor**: Adam Cole said that the Undisputed Era was holding him back, but there will be nothing holding him back here. He's facing off with Kyle O'Reilly who is still not medically cleared to compete. While that may make it obvious that Cole beats O'Reilly, the two men have proven willing to destroy everything in their path. The only likely scenario is both men leaving on a stretcher. 

##**Ember Moon and Shotzi Blackheart vs The Way for the *NXT Women's Tag Team Championships*.**

Candice LeRae and Shotzi Blackheart have been engaged in a rivalry for the better part of eight months. Their issues lead them into WarGames, and when these two teams faced off in the semi-finals of the Dusty Cup, it was Blackheart and Moon that emerged victorious. When Dakota Kai and Raquel Gonzalez were screwed out of their shot at the WWE Women's Tag Team Championships by WWE official Adam Pearce, William Regal rectified the situation by creating NXT Women's Tag Team Championships, and awarding them to Kai and Gonzalez. Moon and Blackheart would immediately challenge the duo for the titles, with Moon and Blackheart emerging victorious later that night. While most of the locker room was happy for them, The Way were not, and challenged them to a match at TakeOver. 

**Key factor**: The Way have been dealing with internal issues stemming from Dexter Lumis kidnapping Austin Theory and Indi Hartwell's crush on Lumis. Blackheart and Moon are on a roll and have already knocked off The Way? Do The Way have a way to change that result?

##**Johnny Gargano vs Bronson Reed for the *NXT North American Championship*.**

With a wide range of talent in the NXT midcard, William Regal determined that Gargano's next challenger would be the winner of a Gauntlet Eliminator on night 1 of TakeOver, with the entrants being the last six competitors left in a battle royale. After entering the Gauntlet Eliminator third, Bronson Reed would go on to win and earn the match on Night 2. 

**Key factor**: Gargano has not wanted to face Dexter Lumis, so the prospect of someone else may make him underestimate his opponent. Will Bronson Reed have enough in the tank to overcome Johnny Takeover?

##**Jordan Devlin vs Santos Escobar in a Ladder Match to unify the *NXT Cruiserweight Championships*.**

This match has been a year in the making. Despite capturing the NXT Cruiserweight Championship at Worlds Collide in January 2020, Devlin has been unable to defend it, owing to travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the interim, William Regal created the Interim NXT Cruiserweight Championship, and set a tournament to determine who would hold it. El Hijo del Fantasma would defeat Drake Maverick, before unmasking and revealing himself as Santos Escobar. Flanked by Joaquin Wilde and Raul Mendoza, they made up Legado del Fantasma and have run roughshot over the Cruiserweight division. Tired of holding open challenges in NXT UK, Devlin would return to NXT, branding Escobar a ""fill-in champion"" and demanding a unification match. The final piece of the puzzle would come via Shawn Michaels, who slid a ladder into the ring, making this a ladder match.

**Key factor**: Wherever Santos Escobar goes, Wilde and Mendoza are never far behind.

For example, Zack revealed that Joker killed ""Dick Greyson"" (Batman's adopted son who becomes Nightwing) and not ""Jason Todd""(Batman's other adopted son who becomes Robin). So there are stuff that he made to make it ""Snyder-Verse"" (Word play on universe).

Answering your question.
- According to the ""Arrow"" series, Deathstroke lost his eye fighting the ""Green Arrow aka Oliver Queen"". In one of the comics ""Damian"" (Biological son of Batman) took out his eye. But in the ZSJL Lex Luthor and Deathstroke talk in a way hinting that ""Batman"" took out his eye.

So since there are these small minor changes, there are only theories of what the actual back story is, to what ZS actually wants the back story to be.

- Superman in the last sequence in the movie is shown as working against the Justice League and whomever is left behind because, that is a glimpse of a timeline of what would have happened if Louis died and Superman had no one to bring him back to him. For superman, Louis is the key to the humanity. ZS also revealed that Bruce and Louis had a thing (Pregnant) in that timeline when superman was dead. So superman was partially furious about it. This whole ""Nightmare sequence"" thing doesn't exist in comics at all. It was just in ""Snyder-Verse"". So Darkseid takes superman to his side and uses him to kill the other superheroes. But then thankfully this turns out to be Bruce's dream.

- The actual battle between Darkseid and Justice League would happen in the future ZS's project if it gets a green light. The Justice League for the Darkseid fight is much larger. So there is obviously Superman, Batman, Wonder woman, Cyborg and the Flash. In the animated version is the a Green Lantern, Green Arrow and Shazam. They kill Darkseid once and for all together. The whole killing Darkseid technique is amazing!!!

- Martin Manhunter is from Mars according to comics and he came here as his world was destroyed. I'm not sure exactly how, it been a long time I forgot. But he came here and used his abilities to exist as a human (John Jones). He appeared in Man of steel but we didn't know he was Martin Manhunter then. You might ask where was he when everything was going hay wire? Well we don't know. Zack is yet to revel that info once we get ZSJL part 2 and 3. Yes it's a trilogy. He will surely reveal his back story. 1st time he made the cameo as Clark's mom cuz he wanted to make sure that Louis was still in the game. Louis did what she does. But I'm thinking that he made sure that Louis came to Superman's memorial that day so that she will be nearby when superman went haywire. I'm not sure about that part. 
2nd time he revealed himself to Bruce to make sure that he knows that he exists and will be there to help him. That's all. Martian Manhunter plays an important part in the next part of JL.

Will running my MacBook Air while plugged in improve its battery life? I usually charge my MacBook Air to above 90% and then use it unplugged until it drains to 25-35% levels.

Short answer with caveats, is yes. Using your MacBook Air while plugged in will preserve rather than improve your battery life.

If you use your Mac while it is plugged in, and the battery is fully charged, the battery is bypassed and you will be using power directly from the power adapter.

The answer to your question lies in what’s referred to as charge cycles. In general, the number of cycles for a rechargeable battery indicates how many times it can undergo the process of complete charging and discharging until failure or it begins to lose capacity.

It is always good to look at an example, so h

Inflation can occur simply based on expectation, even in a perfectly competitive market. This is the type of inflation we might call baseline inflation. However eliminating monopoly power would take away an essential ingredient of excess or accelerating inflation, so that should make that

TL;DR: Doing this the way you are is probably actually shortening your battery life by using up more ""charge cycles"" than you strictly need to. Your battery needs ""exercise"", but it doesn't need that much exercise – one full discharge/recharge per month (or any combination of smaller discharge/recharge cycles that more or less add up to about 100%) is all you need to worry about, and you can then run from external power the rest of the time.

There are a lot of myths out there about how rechargeable batteries should be handled, and these cause a lot of unnecessary angst among users who are concerned about not using their batteries ""properly.""

Almost all of these came from the days of Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) batteries, and variations thereof. Nickel-based batteries had issues with names such as ""memory effect"" and ""overcharging"" that simply do not apply to the Lithium-Ion and Lithium-Polymer batteries that are used in virtually all modern electronic devices.

I wrote about this a couple of years ago in regards to iPad, iPhone, and iPod battery life, but the same principles apply to a MacBook or just about any other laptop or mobile computing device. You can read my full previous article here: Best Practices for iPad Battery Charging

To summarize the key points:

When you run your MacBook plugged into external power and it's charged to 100%, you're not using the battery at all – you're simply running from external power.
You cannot overcharge your MacBook battery. The charging circuit cuts off when it hits 100%, at which point it runs from external power.
The life of a rechargeable battery is measured in cycles. One full discharge and recharge is a single ""cycle."" Discharging to 50% and recharging is 1/2 of a cycle, and so forth.
If you don't discharge your MacBook at all, you're basically using zero cycles, which will obviously extend your rechargeable battery life when you do need it.
The only caveat is that you do need to do one complete discharge/recharge cycle about once per month to ""exercise"" the battery. If you leave your MacBook plugged in all the time, it's pretty much the same as leaving it OFF all the time, since the battery doesn't get used at all.
This ""one complete cycle per month"" can be cumulative -- it doesn't have to be a time when you drain it zero and recharge it. Draining it to 80% five times per month, or 90% ten times per month would still count as a single cycle.
In summary, you don't need to sweat too much about battery life. Leaving your MacBook plugged in most of the time will not hurt your battery life, as long as you're not leaving it plugged in ALL the time. Work from a Starbucks (or your couch :) ) for a few hours without plugging in a couple of times per month and that's really all you need to worry about.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1616867063.0,,False,0.0,{},gshdjcd,False,t3_kg2obq,False,t1_gshdjcd,False,t3_kg2obq,/r/macbookair/comments/kg2obq/m1_mac_battery_care_tips/gshdjcd/,,1.0,False,True,False,macbookair,t5_2wojj,,public,,0.0,[],,,1627292480.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ignited what is known around town as ""Blazermania"" and has led to the city being called ""Rip City"" (for the ripping sound the net makes during a swoosh).

The only major league team in Portland for the longest time, the Blazers quickly became a symbol of Portland pride and independence, having won more seasons than lost.

Due to mismanagement and injuries suffered by key players, Blazer fans often ask ""What if?"" regarding the team.

For example, after winning the Finals in 1977, the Blazers were on pace to break the NBA win record the following season.  Unfortunately, injuries to the league MVP, Bill Walton, ruined his career and a potential Blazer dynasty.

Likewise, Portland let go of numerous Hall of Famers that went on to win championships elsewhere - trading away Moses Malone, not drafting Larry Bird, and skipping out on THE Michael Jordan.

Furthermore, the Blazers drafted a player from the Soviet Union named Arvydas Sabonis, who could potentially have become a Top 20 NBA player ever given his Olympic performances against an actual Top 20 ever talent in David Robinson.  Unfortunately, Sabonis was not able to arrive until after suffering key injuries that limited his mobility and after the Blazers lost twice in the NBA Finals.  This ruined another potential Blazer dynasty.

During the ""Jailblazer"" era of the early 2000s, the Blazers lost their small town, family friendly image as they acquired several talented by troubled players.  They almost beat the Lakers in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals and would have been the favorites in the Finals but choked their double digit lead away during the 4th quarter.

Around 2006-2007, the Blazers acquired three of the most talented young players of their era - Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Greg Oden.  They were projected to become the next great NBA dynasty by many but injuries ended the careers of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy early on.

Now, they are led by superstar Damian Lillard, who has made the playoffs most of his career and continues to break franchise records.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1616641614.0,,False,0.0,{},gs4oltb,False,t3_mce69z,False,t1_gs4oltb,False,t3_mce69z,/r/ripcity/comments/mce69z/franchise_culture/gs4oltb/,,6.0,False,True,False,ripcity,t5_2rt2i,,public,,0.0,[],,,1627273453.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],False,,BrklynDragon,1450811422.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_t5uye,False,False,"&gt; Aren't you happy to be talking to someone who *teaches* statistics? 

No I’m actually mortified that someone (allegedly) certified you to teach this drivel. Teams change their offensive systems in subtle and relatively drastic ways, but you do not play a certain way for 82 games and then completely throw it out come playoffs. It’s not how that works. They’ll run unique and new sets, but the identity of the team and the habits built in the regular season remain. The larger sample size is not necessary and doesn’t apply to the context of the playoffs whatsoever. You might as well be trying to apply preseason stats to the regular season. The discussion from the start, and the general narrative amongst Portland fans is *playoff* performance. Everyone is well aware you can spam Dame and Cj iso/PNR for 80 possessions a game and end up floating somehwere in playoff contention. 

&gt; all teams resort to increased isolation;

The key word here is *resort*. Once again, the point just sails way over your head. It’s important to be good at ISO and we are, nobody is disputing that, but it’s a *resort*. It can’t be a plan A. Your completely contradicting yourself. Good teams can blow up your schemes, that doesn’t mean you still don’t try to run them and generate as much clean offense as you can in the first place. ISOs on good teams that make playoff runs aren’t set up in the half court immediately, they are the result of the offense trying to find a look, finding nothing, THEN going into ISO. You don’t just start with it because it’s still possible to run good offense even if a team is anticipating you. 

Im also aware of what Chris Paul was discussing. Chris Paul also has 0 playoff success to his name as the leader of a team. For every Chris Paul quote explaining the obvious, I’ll find you another from a bonafide NBA champion lamenting how Harden will never win a ring with his iso style of play. 

&gt; Teams you thought of as good passing teams weren’t in the playoffs, 

No, you mentioned specifically Denver and Denver was still a great passing team in the playoffs. APG is not the only metric for passing, they were still 4th in total passes per game, top 10 in secondary assists, top 10 in potential assists, the list goes on and on. 

&gt; Teams have won championships as iso heavy offenses. 

Who? I’d like to see what you consider an iso heavy offense lmao. Yes, it’s all about roster fit. James harden is a better player than Damian lillard, and a better iso player, and he couldn’t win playing iso ball. Chris Paul is better than Cj McCollum. That was a better ISO team, and they lost twice as a unit. The discussion is about the BLAZERS playing iso ball and why it’s bad when the BLAZERS in the playoffs do it, not the general chances that a team with Tim Duncan or Shaq COULD win playing iso ball. 

&gt; Ok. We’ll break this down for you. 

I’m aware no team isos 100% of the time. I was responding to your initial clip about cp3, because by his logic, ISOing at 15% is not nearly frequent enough. They have the best ISO scorer in the league. We shouldn’t ever approach their isolation #s with just dame, let alone how often we let Cj and melo do it. Do you understand the point yet? The rockets haven’t won jack shit despite their immense talent. I actually never absolved the rockets either, not even sure where you got that from. My literal first sentence was “Chris Paul is not a bastion of playoff success”, and I’m not sure if your aware but he played a pretty significant role on the rockets for two years. 

&gt; The idea that we can't use isolation because Dame isn't Harden and so our use of isolation is ineffective is a bad point. 

Straw men top to bottom. Never said we can’t iso with Dame. We can iso with dame. At least in the regular season, we get by with it. The point that I have reiterated for the millionth time here, is it’s a worse strategy in the playoffs because even with the BEST iso player in the league (which dame is not), it’s a losing strategy. It doesn’t translate to Playoff success.   

&gt; The idea that Dame's isolations are unsustainable because he's not Harden when he's been producing at the same efficiency is, like the rest of your points, shallow and unsupported by the data.

**REBUILDING BUDDY: INSIDE PLAN FOR STAR’S RETURN**

Operation: Rebuild ‘Buddy’ began in earnest when Sydney pulled the pin on the superstar forward’s season in August last year.

That decision meant Lance Franklin failed to play a game for an entire season for the first time in a celebrated AFL career, which enters year 17 in 2021.

There are still two seasons left on his extravagant nine-year, $10 million megadeal that helped the Swans rip him from Hawthorn’s grasp and blindside their arch rivals, the Giants, and the rest of the AFL.

Groin soreness was the technical cause of his premature end to last year, but a serious right hamstring tear was what destroyed Franklin’s campaign, after he had a knee arthroscope in January.

When the 34-year-old sits out Round 1 next weekend, as coach John Longmire has already confirmed — this time after a calf muscle setback in late January — he will have missed 26 of Sydney’s past 27 matches.

The only game Franklin played in that period was in Round 23, 2019 against St Kilda, which doubled as his 300th.

He skipped the previous eight contests because of his second left hamstring injury of that season, with the first costing him a month of play.

Franklin’s horror injury run started in 2018, even though he racked up 19 appearances that year.

The bruised heel he sustained in a stunning eight-goal performance against West Coast in the historic first match at Perth Stadium haunted him all season.

A mid-year Longmire sound bite became part of Franklin’s narrative: “He’s probably trained about 20 minutes for the season.”

Then, Franklin suffered a groin injury in the Swans’ elimination final loss to the Giants, which they initially hoped would recover with rest but ultimately needed surgery.

“That’s when we started to see the deconditioning and impact of him missing a substantial amount of training and footy,” the club’s football boss, Charlie Gardiner, told The Daily Telegraph.

“He suffered a couple of hamstrings in 2019, then a big hamstring at the start of 2020 — just when he was returning to some really good fitness and was looking really good — which interrupted the entirety of 2020.

“We made the call two-thirds of the way through last year to take getting back to playing off the table, and look to try to rebuild him as best we can.”

Rob Innes, who crossed from reigning premier Richmond, and Damian Raper are the new fitness staff in charge at Sydney, replacing long-serving Rob Spurrs and Matt Cameron, respectively.

But rather than a change in philosophy towards Franklin’s rehabilitation, Innes and Raper have continued the plan that was agreed upon before the previous duo departed in December.

The idea was for Franklin to complete an extensive core strengthening program across many months, which Longmire detailed after his spearhead experienced calf tightness in January.

The focus areas were his groin, hamstrings and adductors, and the results so far — bar the calf hiccup — are promising. Gardiner says Round 2 could yet mark Franklin’s return.

“He’s done a lot of work, and probably more training than he’s ever done consistently in the last 18-24 months,” Gardiner said.

“It’s been a pretty patient build; making sure we’re conservative with the way we ramp him up.

“Our medical team has put together a tailored program and he’s responding well to that and doing 8-10km sessions consistently.

“We haven’t made a call on when he’s right. It’s a bit of, ‘He’s right when he’s right’. We understand everyone’s infatuation with putting a date on it, but in terms of round two, three, four — we think it’ll be early in the season.

“We haven’t ruled out round two, but it very much depends on what he does over the next two weeks.”

The Swans’ messaging about Franklin’s calf issue was consistent from the outset: it would set him back about a week and was only minor.

The understandable hysteria that followed wasn’t about this latest problem, but rather the accumulation of injuries that threaten to prevent a fitting finish to his remarkable career.

Sydney officials hope this time will be different, but accept he will need to be monitored closely for the rest of his playing days. The critics need to see the evidence on-field.

Longmire and Sydney stars Callum Mills and Isaac Heeney have all relayed Franklin’s wish to play in Round 1, which the coach has shut down.

Franklin’s in full training with the main group and getting involved in match play and drills.

“Hopefully, everyone understands that we’ve got to get him right for the whole season and that means he might not play every game for the season,” Longmire said.

“That’s OK, too. We just work through it.”

Making matters more problematic is the back-ended nature of Franklin’s contentious contract, which has, at best, added to the Swans’ salary cap difficulties and, at worst, is their greatest headache.

Sydney’s list management crew had at least two key priorities when they structured the deal back in 2013, the season Franklin played a pivotal role in the first of Hawthorn’s premiership hat-trick.

He and his then-agent, Liam Pickering, met Longmire and the club’s former chief executive Andrew Ireland before that season even began.

Firstly, the Swans had to put something together the Hawks wouldn’t match and, secondly, they had to pay Franklin ‘unders’ in his early seasons, when plenty of high-profile teammates were also on a good wicket.

Think Kurt Tippett, Josh Kennedy, Kieren Jack, Jarrad McVeigh, Nick Malceski, emerging pair Dan Hannebery and Sam Reid, and even a 34-year-old Adam Goodes.

Shane Mumford accepted a lucrative deal with Greater Western Sydney the day after Franklin’s move to the Harbour City became official.

In the immediate years following, Malceski left for Gold Coast and Tom Mitchell for Hawthorn, while Lewis Roberts-Thomson, Ryan O’Keefe, Goodes, Rhyce Shaw, Mike Pyke and Ted Richards retired.

Much was made of the Mumford and Mitchell exits, in particular, with that pair viewed — in some quarters — as sacrificial lambs, with Franklin’s payday creating a salary cap squeeze.

Sydney’s recruitment of Tippett and Franklin in consecutive years also proved the catalyst in the AFL stripping the Swans and Giants of their cost of living allowance (COLA).

Both NSW clubs argue to this day that COLA put them on a level playing field with their opponents, rather than delivering an advantage.

“That would’ve been a challenge for any club, when you have effectively $1 million ripped out of your spending capacity, together with some of the other unique market forces we’ve got in NSW,” Gardiner said.

“As a club, we don’t talk about specific contracts and players, and I don’t want to do that, but there’s no denying (the Franklin deal) was a bold move the club made.

“It must be remembered that the environment in 2014 was very different to the one we are in now. The club’s list strategy and approach to trade has needed to evolve with the significant change in landscape since that time.”

They convinced Joe Daniher to play for them in 2019, only for Essendon to refuse to budge, before the Brisbane Lions swooped on the wantaway ex-Bomber last year.

Outside of Daniher, they’ve targeted delisted or undervalued players at other clubs — the likes of Ryan Clarke, Lewis Taylor, Sam Gray, Jackson Thurlow and Daniel Menzel — and invested in the draft.

Daniher would’ve been Sydney’s latest big-name forward recruit, behind Franklin, Barry Hall and Tony Lockett.

Instead, the Swans are planning for No. 4 draft pick Logan McDonald, a highly-touted West Australian teenager, to be Franklin’s successor.

**Was the deal a success?**

There will never be a unanimous answer to this question, unless Franklin delivers Sydney a premiership. Even then, there will be naysayers.

Franklin played in three Grand Finals and won two flags with Hawthorn, then lost twice on the AFL’s biggest stage as a Swan in 2014 and 2016.

The first of those was against the Hawks, and both times Sydney was the minor premier.

Franklin’s matched the All-Australian (four times) and Coleman Medal (twice) feats he achieved at Hawthorn and has won the Swans’ goalkicking on five occasions compared to six in brown and gold.

But the zero in the premierships column is where many critics start and finish when grading the free agency deal.

They’ll tell you Franklin set that bar at his introductory press conference in October 2013: “Hopefully, we can win a few more premierships.”

It was never that black and white, particularly in a Sydney market dominated by the rugby codes that often needs an out-and-out superstar to drag the most casual of fans through the AFL turnstiles.

Franklin’s on-field performances for the Swans have been exceptional — 364 goals in 118 matches, including 73 or more in three seasons — and he gave them a great shot at ultimate success.

As is well documented, he is only 56 goals short of reaching 1000 in his career, a target firmly in his mind.

Not every rival list boss The Daily Telegraph spoke to this week backed Sydney’s decision to offer Franklin such a gaudy deal, but there was a common catchcry.

When you’re in that premiership window, you do whatever it takes to win one.

The Swans undoubtedly did that with Franklin.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1616137800.0,,False,0.0,{},grgg8bn,True,t3_m8bhy6,False,t1_grgg8bn,False,t3_m8bhy6,/r/sydneyswans/comments/m8bhy6/can_the_swans_gatecrash_this_years_finals/grgg8bn/,,5.0,False,True,False,sydneyswans,t5_2up9r,,public,,0.0,[],,,1627231408.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientists say restoring the lush habitats would boost wildlife, protect coasts and store carbon - by Damian Carrington, Environment Editor: @dpcarrington

Thu 4 Mar 2021 05.00 GMT

The UK has lost more than 90% of the lush seagrass meadows that once surrounded the nation, research has found.

Scientists described the decline as catastrophic, but the latest analysis also shows where the flowering plants could be restored. A resurgence of seagrass meadows would rapidly absorb the carbon dioxide that drives the climate crisis and provide habitats for hundreds of millions of fish, from seahorses to juvenile cod.

Seagrasses declined across the world but the study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, is the first to assess the remaining meadows and historical losses for a country. The grasses grow up to 2m long in clear water where sunlight passes through. They once covered most sand and mudflats.

By identifying suitable habitat for seagrasses, the scientists concluded that 92% had been lost in the last century or two. Pollution from industry, mining and farming, along with dredging, bottom trawling and coastal development are to blame.

There are only 8,500 hectares of seagrass meadow left, say the scientists, an area similar in size to Newcastle upon Tyne. Almost half of the losses are likely to have been in the last three decades, significantly worse than the estimated global average, according to the study.

A few places have retained healthy meadows, such as Lindisfarne, Studland Bay in Dorset, some parts of Devon and the Scilly Isles. Elsewhere, however, in areas such as south Wales and the Humber and Tyne estuaries, many have been destroyed.

“The catastrophic losses documented in this research are alarming, but offer a snapshot of the potential of this habitat if efforts are made to protect and restore seagrass meadows across the UK,” said Alix Green at University College London (UCL), who led the work. “The UK is lucky to have such a resource in our waters, and we should fight to protect it.”

Seagrass flowers are pollinated by shrimps and other creatures, as well as water currents. The meadows can store carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and harbour up to 40 times more marine life than bare seabeds.

“Seagrass is the most amazing habitat that no one has ever heard of,” Green said. “If they are left undisturbed, seagrass soils will persist for thousands of years, and act as permanent carbon storage. Seagrass meadows can rebound, if allowed to, and it used to be everywhere, so there are limitless opportunities to build it back.” The Seagrass Ocean Rescue project is already planting millions of seeds on the shallow seafloor in Dale Bay, Pembrokeshire.

Peter Jones, also at UCL, said: “The next decade is a crucial window of opportunity to address the inter-related crises of biodiversity loss and climate change. The restoration of seagrass meadows would be an important contribution to this. This will involve restrictions such as reduced boat anchor damage, restricting damaging fishing methods and reducing coastal pollution.”

Seagrass meadows are nurseries for many species, whose larvae and juveniles can hide and feed among the fronds. These include dogfish, which are tiny sharks, and the UK’s only seahorses, as well as commercially important fish such as cod, flounder and mullet.

“Beyond their beauty, they are useful for a number of other reasons,” said Green. “They protect the shoreline from coastal erosion, by absorbing the impact of storms. One of the biggest impacts for the UK from climate change is rising sea levels and more severe storms and having these sort of buffer habitats is a lot cheaper and better environmentally than building a bunch of sea walls.”

Seagrass covers about 0.1% of the ocean globally but provides 10% of its carbon storage. A 2020 UN report, however, said 7% of this key marine habitat was being lost worldwide each year, equivalent to a football field of seagrass vanishing every 30 minutes.

Unesco published its first global assessment on Tuesday of the carbon storing ecosystems in its 50 marine World Heritage sites. It found they hosted a fifth of the global total of “blue carbon” habitats. Three sites in Australia have more than 2bn tonnes of CO2 locked away in their vast seagrass meadows, coastal mangroves and tidal marshes.

“They store so much carbon that these ecosystems become sources of CO2 emissions when they are degraded or destroyed,” said the lead author, Prof Carlos Duarte at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. “Protection and restoration of these ecosystems present a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change.”

I do still disagree with a couple parts though.

&gt;If Harden doesn't deserve his number retired simply cuz he didn't get a ring with the Rockets..

I did not say this in the slightest.  I said rings carry weight, but are not the end all be all for reasons you have stated.  When I think of a wining player I do not think of Harden.  It is not due to the fact he has no rings, but the way those rocket teams disappointed in the playoffs with him at the helm.  The narrative after every key loss was Harden mailing it in seeming to quit, these could be unfair but it is what comes to mind with Harden.

To give an example of a player who has not won but deserves to have their jersey retirement is actually from a comment above, Damian Lillard.  He has 0 rings, but has taken worse teams further in the playoffs and hit big shots along the way.  More importantly, he embodies the entire Trailblazer's organization.  You think Portland, you think Dame.

Retirements imo should be about what a player brought to the franchise all around.  Harden to me feels more like a guy with incredible solo achievements and numbers who happened to be a Houston Rocket while doing so.

He guards his position. No he is not the primary defender on guys like Steph Curry or Damian Lillard, but he is the primary defender on wing players. In the Laker game against the Bucks for example he was guarding either Giannis Antetokounmpo or Khris Middleton that whole game. Do those guys qualify as the best and second best players on the Bucks? 

Regardless, this whole standard of needing to guard the best player is only a standard that people apply to Lebron because of their high expectations of him. Are you going to tell me that Rudy Gobert guards the best offensive player every night? The second best? Even the third best?

&gt; Our defense is schemed around our bigs protecting the paint and help defense. Our perimter players can be aggressive knowing that if they're beat they have our bigs to rely on to protect the paint, alter shots, and generally disrupt the ball-handler even if they get by. That's why AD gets credited because he was best at that.

No that was last year. This year the Lakers lack rim protectors and have put more emphasis on containment on the perimeter. The Lakers this year lack bigs that's why they just gave up Quinn Cook to sign Damion Jones. They have been missing Javale and Dwight badly.


&gt;Rim protection and bigs are the keys to the majority to all great defenses in the league, that isn't what Lebron does for us, that is what AD does for us. That's why he's credited. I guess you don't pick up on that when you only look at stats but have no idea what any of the stats mean nor can you back them up with any sort of explanation, right?

Well if you watched the games you would know. That's why I have to spell it out with stats. With Davis out Lebron is the Lakers main rim protector. Gasol is only out there for 20 minutes a game and doesn't always close. Lebron is second only to Marc Gasol in blocks for the Lakers since Davis has been out and Lebron is second on the Lakers only to Harrell in charges drawn. So who is really leading the Lakers precious rim protection?

Your comments on the Lakers opponents are completely worthless and show how little you know about basketball. Basically like the SRS nonsense about the Lakers from last year. Every NBA team is good. The difference between a win and a loss is slim. The difference between NBA teams is not much. Even if you fall for that nonsense, the Brooklyn Nets are literally the best offense in the league. The Jazz are 3rd. The Nuggets are 5th. The Blazers are 8th. All these teams the Lakers have recently faced without Ad and yet still maintain the best defense in the NBA.

&gt;Do you want to make an argument as to why Lebron is deserving of first team all defense that isn't reliant on simply statistics

Sure. Now that you've been BTFO by the stats and now just dismiss them because they don't fit your personal narrative in classic r/nba fashion. That's ok though because the stats I told you about are how the voters decide on all-defense selections particularly the 1st team guys.

Ignoring the stats, why is Lebron deserving of 1st team all defense? Because when it comes down to it, he can be the best defensive player in the league and he shows it when he needs to. It's the reason he's the best player in the game. He can be the best scorer, the best passer, the best rebounder, the best perimeter defender, or the best rim protector in the game on any given night, any given season, any given playoff series, in any given moment.

[],False,,chazbol6,1443416521.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_qs7oz,False,False,"• Before that: Ben Simmons gets one spot. He has been more aggressive as a scorer over the past month, even seeking contact around the rim. He's shooting 73.5% on seven free throws per game this month. If that's a harbinger, he will ascend another notch.

Simmons might be the best perimeter defender in basketball. His ability and willingness to defend every position -- including point guards -- means opposing offenses can't scheme away from him as they might against some of the best wing defenders.

Simmons is Philly's main generator of 3-pointers, and he's putting up 16-8-8. The playoffs loom as the ultimate referendum, but he's an All-Star.

• Two spots left. The final candidates were Middleton, VanVleet, LaVine, Randle, Vucevic, Trae Young, and Butler. There is a very slight dividing line between that group and the next tier of Sabonis, Malcolm Brogdon, Harris, Hayward, Rozier, Jerami Grant, Myles Turner, Siakam, Kyle Lowry, Collin Sexton, and maybe Clint Capela and John Collins. You can make reasonable cases for almost all these guys, especially Grant, Sabonis, Hayward, and Harris.

Hayward and Grant have tapered, and Detroit has the East's worst record. That's not on Grant, of course; opponents have outscored the Pistons by only 1.8 points per 100 possessions with Grant on the floor -- a minor miracle. But he is down to 44% shooting and doesn't create much for others.

Harris is in best passing stretch of his career, and has played with fierce decisiveness. The Sixers have outscored opponents when Harris plays without Simmons and Embiid, though mostly due to stingy team defense. This is a painful omission, but Harris is still more of a gap filler around Simmons and Embiid. (He is filling those gaps really well.)

• I'll be honest: Choosing between Middleton, VanVleet, LaVine, Randle, Vucevic, Young, and Butler was impossible. Pick two names from a hat.

VanVleet's advanced numbers are bonkers. He's 18th in ESPN's adjusted plus-minus, and eighth (!) -- one ahead of LeBron James -- in 538's catch-all metric. VanVleet's traditional stats are more pedestrian: 20 points and 6.6 assists on 41% shooting -- 44% on 2s, 37.6% on 3s.

What's going on? Some advanced numbers place heavy weight on the Raptors winning the minutes VanVleet plays without either or both of Lowry and Siakam; they are plus-5.3 per 100 possessions with VanVleet on the floor, and minus-4.7 when he sits. VanVleet is second in the league in minutes -- crucial considering every other key Raptor has missed time. (The Raptors quietly have the East's third-best point differential, behind only Milwaukee and Brooklyn -- and just ahead of Philly.)

Advanced numbers seem to love ball handlers who shoot lots of 3s and rarely turn it over. VanVleet and Mike Conley are this season's prime examples. Maybe advanced numbers overrate these sorts of players. Maybe turnovers -- especially steals -- are that damaging.

VanVleet is a fitting heir to Lowry in that traditional stats will never capture his impact. VanVleet is doing something helpful every second he is on the floor. He's an ace defender at both guard positions. He almost always makes the right pass, at the right time, spoon-feeding teammates into success. He bobs and weaves and screens without the ball, contorting the defense in subtle ways.

He'd be a great choice. I got stuck on that 44% mark on 2s. VanVleet is a shaky finisher around the rim; larger defenders can swallow him up at times. He also has lots of championship-level experience around him as compared to someone like Randle.

• Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe we will look back in two months and wonder how the hell Randle made every midrange jumper and 40% of his 3s on pretty high volume -- 4.5 attempts per 36 minutes. A player who was once a little greedy and out of control dribbling is now making the right decision almost every time: 23 points, 11 rebounds 5.5 assists on that 48/41/80.5 shooting line. Wow.

Randle is in better shape, and that has shown on defense. He is no longer a glaring liability defending power forwards in space. On some nights, he's downright good -- alert, engaged, arms spread wide. He is a better defender than Vucevic, though at a less pivotal position. (The flip side: Randle's bad nights on defense are less damaging than Vucevic's.) The Knicks -- the woebegone Knicks -- have outscored opponents by 2.4 points per 100 possessions with Randle on the floor. They are getting walloped when Randle sits, which he doesn't do much; Randle leads the league in minutes.

• Opponents slaughtering the Magic when Vucevic plays has nothing to do with Vucevic. He is the only thing keeping Orlando relevant amid endless injuries. His shooting and playmaking are more valuable at center than the same skill set in Randle at power forward. Their advanced numbers are neck and neck.

This isn't fair, but if we're splitting impossibly thin hairs, I'm taking the guy whose team is winning when he's on the floor. And don't pretend you thought the Knicks had some killer starting five around Randle.

• I have been lower than consensus on LaVine, and some issues persist. He tosses away too many turnovers. There is at times something frenetic and twitchy about his off-the-bounce game -- almost as if he's playing solo, moving in ways that confuse teammates. He still ball-watches some on defense, and commits occasional gaffes that are unrecoverable -- fatal back-cuts, miscommunications, ducking screens against good shooters. These Bulls, like every prior LaVine team, have been better with LaVine on the bench -- though the margin is shrinking of late. (The same is true for Vucevic this season, though it does not seem a disqualifying factor for him.)

But the scoring and shooting numbers cannot be discounted. LaVine is averaging almost 29 points on ludicrous shooting: 43% on 3s, 58% on 2s. He is one of the league's half-dozen most explosive cutters.

He's calmer making plays. When teams trap him, LaVine slips more easy passes to Thaddeus ""Thadgic"" Young (hat tip: Stacey King) and Wendell Carter Jr. -- and watches as the Bulls spray the ball around.

Young has been Chicago's second-best player. The Bulls have outscored opponents by 9.8 points per 100 possessions when Young and LaVine share the floor. Some of LaVine's bad on-court/off-court splits have to do with teammates -- with LaVine starting alongside an ever-changing cast of unproven guys as the usual suspects nurse injuries.

LaVine is still a minus defender, but he has been more diligent. His rotations are a little crisper. He works one-on-one. He can be a vertical presence at the rim. That shows up in advanced stats, which don't rate him much differently on that end (if at all) than Middleton, Vucevic, Trae Young, Beal, and others.

• For some, this spot will be between Trae Young and LaVine. Neither is helping on defense. It really comes down to Young's passing and free throws against LaVine's ultra-efficient shooting. Advanced stats lean Young. The Hawks still can't muster any offense when he sits. Their teams are about equal. I'll shrug and take LaVine.

In a high-stakes playoff game, I'd prefer VanVleet and Middleton to both. In choosing this season's All-Stars, I'm taking LaVine by the slightest of margins.

So my East reserves: Tatum, Brown, Adebayo, Irving, Simmons, Randle, LaVine

FC Nikola Jokic

The only debate was whom to ""bench"" among Curry, Lillard, and Luka Doncic. All three are MVP candidates for limited and injury-riddled teams. Curry and Lillard have shot it better. Doncic is the superior playmaker, though Curry is brilliant and Lillard makes subtle improvements every season. Lillard is posting a career-best assist rate, and dishing 8.8 dimes per game since CJ McCollum's injury.

Doncic's size and rebounding offer the Dallas Mavericks more schematic flexibility on defense.

The Portland Trail Blazers are punching above their weight at 18-12 with a negative point differential. They are doing so because Lillard has gone scorched-earth in crunch time. He is shooting a remarkable 24-of-39 -- 10-of-17 on 3s! -- in the last five minutes of games when the score is within five points. Portland is 12-4 in such games, the league's second-best record.

I would like to bring Vanderpool back this season to see if he can correct and fine tune the new defensive scheme Stotts is implementing. I think the reason he was so successful was he was able to utilize personnel that are lesser defenders and create a team defense that wasn't horrid (referring to the 18-19 wcf team). He's also very well liked in our locker room, so I would seriously expect a bump in energy on that end of the ball just because they want to show that their guy can get the job done as a defensive coach.

John took the extended hand and pulled the frozen machine out of the muck, the dead limbs cracking, shedding moss and leaves as he lifted a leg into a fireman's lift. Holding her over the back of his shoulders. 

John pulled his ute (two seater utility vehicle) into town and drove right up to the doctor, tapping out country music into his steering wheel before setting the handbrake and leaving the keys in the ignition. John stood by patiently, watching the doctors synthetic hands repair Simon’s, he had lost it when repairing a baler 3 months back. Turns out cows don’t mind Simon seasoned hay bales.

“Be with you in a second John.” said Doctor Thatcher. The cigarette in his lips joined the smoke of the soldering iron to curl over his glasses and into his balding wispy hair.

“That should do it Simon, stop checking the electric fences with it. Meat heals for free, this doesn’t.” 

“Sorry Doc.” said Simon, his curious eyes watching the doctor close down the casing.

“Simon, how much did that new baler cost anyway?” asked John.

“400” said Simon.

John stroked his chin. Instead of borrowing Simon’s the two of them could run fields in half the time. John made the usual goodbyes to Simon, trying to contain his giddy excitement.

“Doctor, I want to get a quote.” said John as he pulled back the tarp to reveal the twisted limbs of the doll, haphazardly laid into the tray of his ute.

“Holy shit… she hot?” asked Doc.

“Nah, just warm.”

“Original RTG… probably on its third halflife, still, I assume you want me to look into a potential buyer.” said Doc.

John snapped his fingers. “That’s it, new baler…. Maybe a new tractor. I’ll give you a cut if you help me sell her, you can upgrade those arms of yours.”

Doc glanced to his hand, he didn’t mirror John’s excitement but that was Doc’s way since the war.

“I’ll take a look John but in the meantime, take her home and clean her up, she will fetch a better price.”

“How much higher?”

“Few percent, but a few percent on a lot.” said Doc.

\-

John pulled the ute into his workshop to sit beside his old tractor and grabbed the power washer. It was probably too much. It looked quite delicate with it’s thin fingers still reaching up toward him. John hauled the heavy body to his workbench instead, dropping some terps onto a rag and wiping away the grime. The bucket beside him slowly filled with dead leaves and clumps of moss. The skin was still smooth under all that garbage and John couldn’t see any outward damage. Nobody had confused it for a kangaroo or anything.

“What happened to you?” asked John as the cloth cleaned up one of it’s fingers. He stared at it’s grimy face, the hair would need to be replaced. John’s hand paused with the rag.

“Let’s clean your face first.”

The features were perfectly symmetrical, like an only fans model.

“They did make you pretty, I’ll give you that.”

John cut away the decomposed clothes, adding them to the bucket. The doctor was right, It would fetch a better price in this state.

\-

John stood on his porch watching the herd of cows run alongside the car as it made its way up the driveway. He sipped his coffee and slowly stepped down toward the workshop as the little town car crackled in the morning sun. 

“Hey Doc, what brings you out here?”

“Just taking a look at her and dropping off some stuff.”

“Shit, you should have called, I could have sent a picture and picked it up on my next run.” said John, he gestured to the workshop with his mug.

“She looks better.” said Doc.

“Yeah, good advice on cleaning it by the way.”

“You should probably keep her inside, I know you’re not worried about thieves but a straight man would turn crooked at the sight of her.”

John felt silly again, he had a point.

“I brought this.” said Doc, handing John an old worn book with ‘Michael Thatcher’ scrawled on the second page. ‘Diagnostics for dummies for dummies’

“Eh, going to see how it’s doing inside?” asked John.

“Well if you want to sell it as is…” said Doc.

“No no, that makes sense, It will be fun, any potential buyers?”

“A few but their prices are shit, they would just fix her up and flip her.”

“Cheers for the book, want a coffee?”

“Nah, I’m headed to Damian’s, make sure you put her inside.”

“Will do Doc.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1613877269.0,,False,0.0,{},go6t1ku,False,t3_loju7j,False,t1_go6t1ku,False,t3_loju7j,/r/DirtyWritingPrompts/comments/loju7j/wp_on_a_hike_through_the_woods_you_come_across_a/go6t1ku/,,12.0,False,True,False,DirtyWritingPrompts,t5_312kw,,public,,0.0,[],,,1627024683.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I appreciate PGs ECF run a lot as well. Similarly Jimmy Butler in last year's finals was insanely good. He matched LeBron for 4 out of 6 games, including that one crazy game where Bron would hit every 3 and scored at legendary pace just to face Jimmy Butler doing the same while playing almost the entire game. I thought Jimmy was a winning player for a long time now but winning the battle of 40 point games against Bron with an undermanned squad is an all-time great performance in my opinion. 

Jokic last season was crazy as well. He was the player that truly held the Nuggets together and brought them to the WCF.

A couple of Damian Lillard post season runs. A couple of Harden playoff runs as well as Westbrook carrying OKC past the Clippers when Durant was struggling. Prime Westbrook with KD in OKC was a reliable player that brought key buckets and defensive stops. There were many games where Brodie was the best player 2014-2016.

Tim Duncan in the early 2000s. He averaged something like 28/15/5blocks in the finals. One of the best finals performances ever period. When talking about the great 2000s playoff runs usually Shaq Wade and Bron are brought up but Timmy was just as good invidiually and not just a product of an all-time great player playing for one of the bestfranchises.

[],False,,wordsmith99,1611002016.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9vscncjl,False,False,"I sigh as I clutch my tail, wringing gently like a dish rag, still not quite used to the anatomical addition, while I watch the spectacle going on at the front of the class. Jesse, gifted with the powers of Thor and Damian, who received the mantle of Hecate, are showing off there. When I first heard of this new training course for Mythics, as we have come to be known, I was excited. The chance to meet others like me and learn more about the fascinating new world we found ourselves in? Count me in!

But things aren\`t going quite the way I expected. All of my classmates, gifted with power from gods and heroes of legend, well renowned all over the world, are undeniably arrogant, bullying wretches for the most part. They have taken the power granted to them by the heavens and are now squandering it in inane attempts to increase their popularity or to gain face, this is simply shameless to me. There are, of course, exceptions. Alex, my only real friend here, with the powers of Ghanesh, remains stoic and earnest in his determination to master his abilities, quite impressive if I do say so myself. Also, Alexandra, gifted with the powers of Athena, has remained low key and diligent in her studies from what I can tell. 

Of course, I may be somewhat biased in my thinking. I have taken to my new gifts like a fish to water (which, in fact, I have tried, rather fun actually!). Given this, I have become more secure in my own estimation of myself and don\`t require the acknowledgement of others to be happy. Also, my predecessor\`s state of mind was known to be very stable for the most part, and I seem to adopt more and more of his personality as I master my abilities. But unfortunately, this is becoming something of a double edged sword, this new part of my personality is now urging me to show these buffoons how little they actually are; for I am capable of storming the heavens, in front of me, they are nothing but ants. My own arrogance is certainly at play here, but I have accepted that part of myself, and am now contemplating just how to begin my lesson to these urchins.

An idea coming to mind, I stand up from my seat at the back of the room and make my way to the challenging area at the front, shaped somewhat like an arena. The previous duel between Jesse and Damian now comes to an end with a draw(rather boring if you ask me), both participants walking off the arena. I step onto the arena, my first time having done so, catching the attention of many of my classmates, their interest peaked since I usually maintain a low profile.

I calmly smile, my tail lashing the air behind me, as I state, ""I challenge Eric.""

A stunned silence comes over the class at my words, no one had challenged Eric since the first week of class. He brutally beat down 4 challengers, all who were in the top ten of our class, and then no one else dared to challenge him. And he loved it. The arrogant godling, who had the powers of Ares, was the worst of the lot in my opinion. If I showed how much like trash he really was, those whose power was less than his should all take notice, hopefully. 

Eric, in answer to my challenge, stands up from his circle of sycophants with a smug smile on his handsome face and makes his way to the arena floor.

""So, after not having fought at all before, you want to challenge me? Are you courting death? I will not go easy on you, my powers were made to kill!"" he states impetuously.

I merely smile back at him and quirk my brow, ""I won\`t know unless I try, will I? You and your little band of arrogant scum have had your fun long enough. It\`s up to me, the inheritor of the great Sun Wukong, to show you the error of your ways. You are nothing under the heavens.""

His eyes widen at my words, his brow tightening in anger as he growls, ""I will show you your place little monkey. You will regret this.""

At his words, I merely transform into a small monkey and moon him. Quite enjoying myself, I jump up and down a few times, squawking in my monkey way.

Enraged beyond reason now, Eric rushes at me full speed! In response, I jump and land behind him, easily clearing 100 feet, well below my limit. And then I moon him again, laughing in my small monkey form. This, of course, removes all restraint from him, as a blood red aura condenses around his figure and shrouds him in bloody armor. He roars and charges at me once again!

Deciding to get serious now, my body twists and shifts until I stand at a towering 8 feet tall in my resting form, that of a monkey human hybrid. I have a small crown resting between my ears and an ornate golden staff wrapped in my tail. I smirk down at this puny war god wannabe and take his rush head on. 

BOOM!

Our collision shakes the building and causes dust to fall from the ceiling, I am only moved a single step back but Eric is launched a dozen feet, landing flat on his back with a dull thump. He quickly struggles back to his feet and condenses a blood red sword in his hand, while screaming out, madness evident in his eyes and voice, ""**Bloody Slash**!""

A crimson sword aura spins off from his blade and rushes at me at high speed, or at least high speed for everyone else. For me, the great Sun Wukong, this speed is that of a turtle. I merely transform my arm into a small golden shield and rebound the strike back at him. This catches him by surprise and he quickly ducks to avoid his own strike. As he comes back to his full height, he stares at me in bewilderment and not a small amount of fear. That last strike had easily overcome all of his other opponents but didn\`t even faze me. All without me having launched a strike, he was seeing the folly of his own arrogance. All was going to plan. Now, the final step...

crushing him mercilessly.

In a blur, my staff was in my hands, then spinning in my fingers, shrunk down to the size of a tooth pick, then back to full size again, as I brandished it in the air. The staff sang out, overjoyed at being used in battle once more. It felt like an old friend, going into war shoulder to shoulder beside me. Staff outstretched, I jab it in Eric\`s direction as my voice booms out,

 ""**Eternal Staff Strike**!""

An ephemeral and powerful staff aura slips out of the end of my staff and flies toward him at a leisurely pace. No extreme speed is needed, the power is undeniable. As the staff aura nears Eric, he panics and tries to dodge, but just as he does the aura seems to explode into a dozen and then a thousand, and then a hundred thousand staff auras in the time it takes to reach him and they all converge on him and his blood red armor!

BOOM!

This time, the very floor cracks under the power of my strike and dust billows up from it, concealing the entire arena and most of the classroom.

I can hear a few classmates talking animatedly with each other, trying to figure out if Eric was able to withstand my strike or not. I smile at this, already certain of the result.

The dust clears and reveals a crumpled and unconscious Eric lying in a small crater, his blood red armor nowhere to be seen and countless cuts and bone breaks visible on his body.

My class instantly erupts, all shocked except for my friend Alex and the wise Alexandra. They never expected anyone to beat Eric, but I clearly trounced him with one strike. It seems my lesson has landed well amongst these other youngsters. As I walk off the arena humbly, many of my classmates look to me with some awe and fear in their gazes. I can hear a few of the more stubborn of them talking amongst themselves about challenging me, claiming my strength was just a trick, no simple monkey could contend with the likes of them.

[],False,,the-big-aa,1376776955.0,,sheetApos58,[],,Glory be to Baskin Robbins!,dark,text,t2_csnl7,False,False,"With his year and change run in NXT, I think the key to making Damian Priest work is having strong characters play off him. Keith Lee, Cameron Grimes (especially), and Johnny Gargano/Leon Ruff all had big personalities so the naturally cool Damian gets over by his imposing figure and his deep voice. His mic work still needs refining but he's definitely improved over the year.

I know people aren't keen on this, but Miz &amp; Morrison are two perfect people to help put Damian over on the main roster. They serve as pretty legit foils to him since they're Hollywood douchebags. Bad Bunny is icing on the cake since he gets over with his eccentric and bold style and nonchalant attitude (what other celebrity has the guts to rock a triple bun hairstyle and act like it's a normal day on the block). I don't know what else they can add to Damian's character to make it stronger, but just don't make it weaker by taking away what worked in NXT.

Also, though I admit this is much less of an issue nowadays, don't feel the need to play up his Latino heritage. Let him stay a rockstar and sure as hell don't make a Reggaeton remix of his theme similar to adding Snoop to Cody's theme in AEW. Don't try to make him into the second coming of [Elvis Crespo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiEbYSF9kE). He already has a solid character; trust him to take it where it needs to go.

Bruce Wayne was in theory ""dead"" (from an editorial and narrative perspective) from 2009 to 2011, he wasn't featured in any books and all the storylines had Dick as Batman and the other Batfamily members dealing with the repercussions of Bruce's absence. But of course, it being main continuity, he returned and its revealed that he never really died, he was just out of comission. 

In order to find a narrative that has a Bruce that is truly dead and who doesn't come back you'd have to look into other continuities. One of the earlier cases being the Batman of Earth 2 in the late 70s (earth 2 being the universe where the original older versions of DC's characters lived in). Here (in several different issues) we see an older Bruce, married to Selina Kyle and with a daughter named Helena.  One of these stories featured the Death of Batman. This Batman actually stayed dead and said death was a point of character development for his daughter Helena, we see her journey as a superhero alongside the JSA. 

After the JSA, in the late 80s and early 90s, came a boom in elseworlds storylines. However these mainly focused on showing ""what if"" ideas of the characters instead of dark futures (Elseworld mainly consists of batman reimaginings like ""Batman as a pirate"" or ""Batman as a priest in the 1700s""). One of the few which did focus on a dark future for the caped crusader was ""Batman: Brotherhood of the bat"", being about Batman's death at the hands of Ra's al Ghul and the usurpers who take the name of the bat. From then on most of DC's futures (kingdom come, Batman Beyond, Dark Knight Returns, Future State, Futures End) Bruce is still alive. 

In recent years we've seen a handful of stories focusing on alternate futures to the DCU however. ""Nightwing: the New Order"" being a great example. Focusing on a universe where the death of Bruce Wayne forced Dick Grayson to make the ultimate decision which changes the course of the Superhero world completely. Tom Taylor's ""DCeased"" shows a dark DCU, destroyed by a deadly virus, Bruce is one of the first casualties and Damian's reaction is key to the story. Im sure there's other stories I've missed but these are the big ones.

Last, there are several alternate futures that exist within the DCU, theres, Flashpoint, the Titans Tomorrow storyline as well as the Batman 666 future. These stories show how Thomas Wayne, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne (respectively) react to the death of Bruce by taking on the Batman cowl.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1612321680.0,,1612322650.0,0.0,{},gltgp13,False,t3_lbdcgb,False,t1_gltgp13,False,t3_lbdcgb,/r/batman/comments/lbdcgb/storylines_where_batman_is_actually_dead/gltgp13/,,6.0,False,True,False,batman,t5_2qqt8,,public,,0.0,[],,,1626832719.0,,,,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My point isn’t about why they didn’t get Harden. I’m just pointing out that since the offseason I’ve been on the win-now train, which is why I’ve always found it hilarious when Heat fans say we shouldnt jeopardize our future by trading away Herro.

2.) Calling someone ignorant, when they were intentionally ignorant (Your Lebron comment was intentionally ignorant) isn’t a childish insult. 

3.) Key word: COULD. He COULD be available, and I say realistically to contrast your ignorant lebron comment. I’m not naming a guy like Damian Lillard or Anthony Davis, I’m naming Zach Lavine. He COULD realistically be available. Why? Because he’s a star player putting up numbers on a bad team. Will he be available? Who knows, that’s not the point. The point is that saying “There’s nobody available to trade Herro for” isn’t true, because when we have these trade discussions, the trade deadline matters. Just because someone isn’t available today doesn’t mean they wont be available in a few weeks. And Lavine is simply one of those guys who could be available, so he’s a name I brought up. Harping on the “evidence” that suggests Lavine’s availability is pointless. It’s reasonable speculation that can be inserted in a discussion about potential trade targets.

4.) No shit we need to worry about the team right now. You’re talking on both sides of the coin right now. Your post was about trading for a big. But yet, you keep saying we should be worried about THIS team whenever I mention trading Herro. Which one is it? So we can discuss trading for other players, until I bring up Herro as an asset? Lmao. “We should trade for a big and build around Herro Jimmy Bam &amp; Dragic”. “I agree except remove Herro from those 4.” “Nah we gotta focus on this team rn, nobody is available”

5.) Chasing Giannis was idiotic, I said it all offseason. So yes I agree with you. I disagree about Herro being a championship player.

6.) Duncan’s off-ball gravity alone makes him a more impactful player than Herro. With that being said, they should both be traded.

Come on dude. Stotts was good early on, and only then, because the cornerstone of his philosophy is to be overly conservative with effort spent on adjustments. That's just who he is. And in this league especially,  the longer you coach that way it will catch up with you exponentially. That's what's happened to Stotts. 

This is why we've gotten better and better pieces over the years (Neil got us Nurk, Afflalo, DJJ, RoCo, and ET honestly) and those improvements don't matter if the dude tasked with running the show can't improve anymore and now scouting us gets easier--a double whammy. 

Terry is still ""living today"" off of two things: 

(1) His assistant coaching staff are phenomenal talent developers (which is why veterans we acquire tend to be stagnant or ""underperform""--they're not coming in to work with assistants because they're key acquisition vets and work on strategy with Terry). Our amazing, overachiever draft picks and trade fluff rooks/sophomores do better than normal because of the trainers and assistant coaches, to their full credit. 

(2) Damian motherfucking Lillard and CJ are fucking winners.

Just imagine that development program we have going for us being eventually fed into a system/team run by someone like Thibs, Coach Bud, MDA, etc. (all of whom were available on the coaching market within the last few seasons).

[],,,Peritract,1283627580.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bbet,False,False,"The key thing, with any mass action scene, is getting across the scale of the conflict while still keeping the narrative clear. If you focus too much on a main thread, then the conflict just becomes window dressing; if you focus too much on the action, then it's a confusing and pointless mess.

You need to balance those two elements quite finely in order to pull it off. Basically, you want to be constantly showing how the brawl/battle/whatever is *progressing* through the details you leave. A conflict - even a mass one - has a beginning and end, moving from one to the other. It doesn't matter whether the beginning is a line of horse appearing on the brow of a hill, or a drunk knocking into the protagonist. There's a sequence of events that need to happen to get from that point to the capture of the city/ambulance arriving.

What that means in practice is that you should show the little elements - show your barman groping beneath the bar for the bat, or an archer's broken bow string. Give all of those chaotic little details to make the scope of the action clear. But each one of those details needs to exist in context with the others. The bow string snaps at the worst possible moment, just as the ladders hit the wall, and then the next detail can be from the people on the ladders. The shotgun blast takes out the wall of spirits, and then the next struggle snapshot takes place over broken glass, with the smell of liquor in the air.

Every moment matters, and every moment is part of the whole.

This is a hard thing to get right, and there aren't too many good examples of it to point to. The one that always springs to mind for me is Graham Moncotte's *The Surplice Surplus*. It's a gritty noir novel that features a mass action scene in Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago. Here's a brief extract to show what I mean:

&gt; Norton made his move during the communion rite, as Trenton had known he would. One moment, there was just a queue of old biddies waiting for their weekly tipple, and the next there was chaos.

&gt; The priest - kindly old father Banton - flew backwards as though blasted by the fist of an angry god. The chalice fell from his hand, a streak of purple lashing out across the white altar cloth.

&gt; The sound seemed to come a second later, a hammer of noise that would have knocked Minton to his knees had he ever stood again after the liturgy of the Eucharist. He was lucky - his innate piety let him stay upright, and his diminished profile saved his life as a wave of bullets zipped by overhead.

&gt; Norton was laughing - laughing - as he stood in the sacristy doorway, a shotgun in one hand and a sleek submachine gun in the other. He wore a blue cassock, black combat boots, and a crazed expression. His sacreligious sidepiece continued to spit fire as he continued to laugh while firing.

&gt; Not all were as lucky as Minton. Damian the altar boy collapsed back against the altar, his intenstines forever altered by the line of fire stitched across him. He had time for a last despairing ring of the bells clutched in his right hand before unconsciousness mercifully took him.

&gt; Seeing his son die, Falton could no longer contain his fury. The decorated war hero, retired cop, and volunteer deacon rose to his feet with an earsplitting bellow of anger. His censer fell from his hand, forgotten: he was incensed by the desecration before him. Twin hands dived into his robe pockets, emerging with twin snub-nosed Walthers. 'Norton, you heretic; meet my friends Cosmas and Damian.'

&gt; Norton's expression changed in that moment from the silent, rictus grin to a moue of consternation; he had no time for anything else as Falton's guns opened up. Tongues of flame erupted from both barrels and Norton danced in the spray of lead; St. Vitus finally had his revenge.

This is one of the shorter scenes, but hopefully you can see how each detail leads into the next - it's a flurry of different and confusing events, but the main thread pulls them together into a narrative.

Before that we don't know what plans they had for him before Tynion pressed them to have him as RR in Robin colours as a sidekick on Tec.

Saviour was supposed to stick around longer , the supersons of tomorrow arc was supposed to be longer and Tim was supposed to have a different key role in Rebirth remember?
Maybe YJ was the plan for Tim.

The new52 not Tim Drake in hind sight would have panned out great in Rebirth because that guy could just be written off as an imposter like new52 Superboy and in Rebirth we could have had the preFlashpoint Tim return along with the YJ core4 and Tim would have had his full history rather than what we have now. 16 year old Tim who has been Robin for 3 years same as Damian. 

DC did give him a new id and also let him be RR in Rebirth.

YJ -Tim and Steph

Outsiders -Duke and Cass

TT - Damian

Tec - Batman, Kate and Luke while Babs, Dick and Jay have their titles. Seems fair to me.

Batman and Tec haven't had a steady batfam presence since the Robin solo was launched. They have been Batman solo with Jim and Alfred as regulars and occasional batfam guesting since the 90's.

Tim sharing the Robin title was after backlash from Drake and likely Bendis power since he did make Tim at the start of YJ briefly. the plan was for Damian to lose the mantle [that was the mandate given to Glass before he took on TT post Rebirth] which I guess got vetoed since they have walked that back

1.32 - Clyde Edwards-Helaire, RB

Saw this as a luxury pick at the time, but became a need after Damian Williams opt out. Accumulated 1,100 rushing/receiving yards, averaging 4.4 YPC behind an O-line that's been....suspect. Incredibly strong runner with balance off the charts. It'll be interesting what he can do behind a healthy O-line. After his week 16 injury it will be a boost for the Chiefs if he can be back for the playoffs. 

Grade: B

2.63 - Willie Gay, LB

Spags has been bringing him along slowly, much to the frustration of fans. Snap counts have been low, but he has performed well in his limited opportunities. Has shown flashes of being the athletic linebacker the Chiefs have desperately needed. As he continues to learn the defense all signs point to him being a very good NFL LB.

Grade A-

3.96 - Lucas Niang, OT

Opted out of the season. Would have provided needed OL depth in a year the OL has been ravaged by injury.

Grade: TBD

4.138 - L'Jarius Sneed, CB/S

Forced into action early due to Breeland's suspension and rose to the occasion. Broke his collarbone in week 3 causing him to miss time. 3 ints, 41 tackles, 2 sacks in 9 games. IMO the best pick of the draft for the Chiefs. Has the versatility and skillset to be a star in the secondary, and has performed as one. Absolute stud.

Grade: A+

5.177 - Mike Danna, DE

Rotational player at DE, has been solid on the DL. Solid run defender with a nose for the ball. 

Grade: B-

7.237 - BoPete Keyes, CB

Played in a ST role primarily. Has provided solid depth in the secondary. Needs to continue developing.

Grade: C-

UDFA: Tommy Townsend, P

After releasing Dustin Colquitt Townsend has been ok as a fill in. Needs to work on downing the ball inside the 10 and more consistent directional punting. 

Grade: C

UDFA: Yasir Durant, OT

Forced to play due to OL injuries. Always more of a developmental player, play has been mediocre at best. 

Grade: D

UDFA: Tershawn Wharton

A training camp favorite who has panned out. From a small local school (Missouri S&amp;T) whose athleticism has earned him a solid spot in the DL rotation. If he can develop a pass rush move to pair with his speed could be a very good player.

No but seriously if anyone else is using bet365 you may have noticed that they added two new categories this season in player points (low) and (high). The low milestones - depending on the player - can seem very generous so I decided to make a parlay with four players, and with steph just breaking 25 points the whole thing cashed @2.68 odds. Very excited to make this a strategy going forward and I’ll update this comment as soon as I craft a new one for tomorrow’s games. LFG


UPDATE:

Today's picks

Joe Harris* o9.5

Donovan Mitchell* o19.5 

Damian Lillard o21.5

Patrick Beverly 05.5

*parlayed together in the same game w/bet builder

Reasoning:

KD is missing tonights game due to COVID protocols. If BKN is gonna win, its either going to take a nuclear performance from Kyrie, or the role players are going to have to step up. Irving is still a nice choice at o22.5 but theres two reasons I like the Harris pick. The first is what I already mentioned, that the role players are going to be relied on more this game. But furthermore, you have to remember that they're going to be going against Rudy Gobert, who is by far the best post defender in the league. For that reason I think that they're going to rely on kickouts and 3-pointers much more this game, which is Harris' bread and butter.

The Mitchell and Lillard picks are pretty simple so far as reasoning goes: these are two first-option guys for their teams who have the green light to keep shooting even when the shots aren't falling. They also are consistently averaging more points than their lines are set at. The consistency is key for me here, I feel more comfortable betting on these guys than say a Paul George, who is currently averaging 25 points per game but has a bigger standard deviation in that score than the other two guys.

That leads me to the PatBev pick; on a clippers team filled with guys where you may not know what you're getting night-to-night, PatBev stands as an outlier in that regard. In 10 games this year, he's only shot under his 5.5 line twice. I'll take those odds.

[],,,Rogthgar,1546362945.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2wgrwu73,False,False,"As such there isn't an issue for me that she is a teenager in the cartoons, since they run on their own continuity... unlike comics where she started out the same age as Dick Grayson, Wally West and Donna Troy... but then deaged to a 16 year old and just sort of left there (which I sometimes think they only do to make her match the current batch of Teen Titans... so she's been nearly the same age as 3 Robins when they were leading). 

The grey skin was never really an issue for me in the first cartoon since they were very deliberately working to give each character their own set of colours... and with Raven it did fit in with the goth-like characteristics they gave her... plus her dad is lobster red so a weird skin-tone was to be expected.

I did so to... much more than I like seeing her being paired with Superman, which as you say seems based only on their similarity in powers. But I kinda get why it wouldn't work, he's always in shadows, she's a shining light. But the key thing that breaks them is that she's willing to take the step neither Bruce or Clark have the stomach for. She's able to kill if she thinks it's the only way, the two others will take any other way and cross their fingers it will hold (which it never does).

As for the pairing, no, I mean I feel there is even less connecting them. Agewise in the cartoons they are fine because the gap is not huge. It's the personalities that doesn't work for me... not to mention it seems to be based on both of them having a father figure thats announced as 'demon'.

* To be honest, Apoc War's emotional high-notes between them fell rather flat for me, because the other two movies didn't build enough for me to see it as anything more than both of them suffering from survivors guilt. They are all that's left of the team, it's made both of them make bad decisions and it seemed like it also made them say things that might be somewhat exaggerated compared to what they would normally do. (I mean Damian says he would have liked her to join him in the LoA, but he did just leave her to spiral into attempted suicide and she had to watch him die before fessing up. It just didn't feel real to me.) 
*  I mean the first cartoon if I am not specifically mentioning the live-action show, because thats quite far removed from what these characters are normally considered... which is one of the main points of criticism it gets, right from the first F-bomb.
* It blurs the line of when it's Raven using her power, and when it's Trigon using his through her or boosting her. And yes, I know she is being assailed by him 24/7, but for this one movie everyone was sort in the same boat of being at their limits somehow. Anyways what I had perhaps hoped for was less Superman and Constantine being the deciding factors and more 'Raven unleashed'.
* Just a matter of the GLC... in comics there is actually an ancient pact (or Cold War) between the Guardians of the Universe and Darkseid to stay out of each other's business because of how costly it would be for both sides to go to war... plus you saw what Darkseid did to the GLC when he felt it was time for him to act. 
* As for Batman not detecting Darkseid watching through Cyborg, yes and no. Yes Batman is very smart, yes he likely knew there was a risk Cyborg was unconsciously doing this... but New Gods tech isn't something anyone on Earth understands to any real degree compared to how the creators do... that's kinda their thing, they wield technology that's so advanced it seems like magic to us.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1609550824.0,,False,0.0,{},ghs5sls,False,t3_koi9h3,False,,True,t1_ghryl58,/r/teentitans/comments/koi9h3/how_accurate_is_ravens_character_from_the/ghs5sls/,1620236319.0,2.0,,True,False,teentitans,t5_2sc3o,r/teentitans,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;How did your team fare relative to expectations last year, and what were key factors that either caused the season to go right or wrong? 

RIP Hamptons 5 Lineup. KD left, Klay was out with a torn ACL, Andre was traded, and Steph missed all but 5 games. Even in those 5 games, Steph was passive trying to get the new guys like DLo acclimated into the system, just like he did when KD first joined. On the bright side it gave great experience to the guys who are basically our bench now and landed us James Wiseman in the draft. 

&gt;How did the moves your team made in the offseason figure to effect the on court product this season? 

Klay's injury is obviously the biggest ""offseason move"". Replacing his production will be a group effort. Kelly Oubre will be a solid addition at both ends. Wiggins isnt a new player but he's only played 1 game with Steph, and at the very least he will get some buckets. Brad Wanamaker and Bazemore are solid experienced bench players who can help shore up the 2nd unit with decent enough 2 way play. Wiseman of course is the wild card here. How good is he? If he plays like a top 2 pick should, then the sky is the limit. At least at the beginning I think he plays about 20-25 min, mainly with Steph and will be a solid rim runner and rim protector at the very least. There's also a chance we add one more player using a Disabled Player Exception worth about 8 million dollars. 

&gt;What do you think are going to be the biggest strengths and weaknesses of your team this year? 

Strengths: Steph Curry is still a gamebreaker, as long as he is on the floor, there will be good looks available for everyone. i actually think paint defense will be solid as well with Draymond, Wiseman, Looney, and Chriss, who really took a step forward last season. I also think our bench is underrated. Looney, Chriss, Wanamaker and Bazemore are experienced guys, Paschall was first team all rookie last year, and Damian Lee and Mulder (assuming he takes the last roster spot) are both good shooters (not good defenders). Jordan Poole has looked good in preseason but we'll see how much he improves from an abysmal rookie season. 

Weaknesses: Perimeter defense. While Oubre will help here, and Wiggins has shown flashes of improved effort we don't have Andre and Klay anymore to shut down opposing perimeter players. We also have a lot of mediocre and unknown quantities when it comes to 3pt shooters. Will guys like Jordan Poole, Paschall, Wiggins be able to imprive their shooting? I personally don't think so. 

&gt;What are some of the key factors that your team’s performance will hinge on? 

How aggressive will Steph be on the ball. Even when Klay wasn't on the floor, the Steph/Dray pick and roll was deadly, hopefully we see a lot more of it. Will Draymond Green play with more fire this season? It was a down year for Draymond but he still showed flashes of a game wrecker on defense when he played with the fire that made him so successful during the peak years. How good is James Wiseman? If he plays like a top pick, this team can be really good. I think the starting 5 as a whole is well constructed given Klay's injury. 

&gt;What are some storylines you will be following for your team in this upcoming season? 

Lot of people, not including myself, believe Steph, and to a lesser extent, Draymond still have something to prove. Will he be able to raise his play to make up for Klay's absence. 

Lot of people have been doubting the warriors since Klay got hurt. 

&gt;And finally, what do you expect your team’s record to be over the course of this 72 game regular season and how do you expect them to fare in the playoffs? 

I don't think anyone can answer this question because of how many unknowns we have. If everyone stays healthy this team can absolutely be a contender. Last time we saw the Warriors rely this much on Steph was 2016 when the team went 73-9. I think the bench is decent enough like it was in 2016. Steph and Dray are still there and Barnes/Bogut have been replaced by Oubre and Wiseman. Yes that team had Klay but as great as he was, I dont think he alone is a 20-30 win difference maker to make this a lottery team. If they miss the playoffs it means Steph got injured.

Last season was a massive disappointment for us, as the injury bug caused us to have our first losing season in quite some time. Having Jusuf Nurkic, Zach Collins and Rodney Hood be out for most of the season was a huge disappointment, but really just exposed our biggest flaw which was a lack of depth. 

Over the course of the regular season, the Blazers started such juggernauts as Anthony Tolliver and Nassir Little When you include Jaylen Hoard, Moses Brown, Mario Hezonja and Skal Labissiere, our regular season forward rotation was an absolute cry for help.

Neil Olshey answered this cry around Thanksgiving by bringing in Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony. Carmelo Anthony was huge for us, not only because he took minutes away from some of the players who had no place in the NBA, but he was also able to fill possessions when the offense was stalling by going to his tough to defend, albeit somewhat inefficient, post game.

One issue Carmelo was not able to solve was the Blazers 26th ranked defense. Much of this was due to the lack of defensive minded forwards (such as the departed Al-Farouq Aminu and Maurice Harkless) that are so crucial to Terry Stott’s drop coverage. When opposing guards inevitably get past Dame and CJ someone needs to be there to clean up the mistakes, and Carmelo Anthony as well as all of the previously mentioned forwards were not able to do that.

That put way too much on the back of Hassan Whiteside, who although is a wonderful rim protector in a limited role, is far too one-dimensional to be able to uphold the entire defense the way we asked him to.

In the bubble once Nurk came back the defense looked a lot better, but unfortunately the 260 pound center who hadn’t played basketball in over a year ran out of gas rather quickly and had a poor series against the Lakers. After another offseason of recovery, and the luxury of center depth that will allow Nurk to ease into the season, I fully expect Nurkic to have a great year.

In addition to Nurkic bouncing back, I think the defense will as well. Olshey brought in Derrick Jones Jr. and Robert Covigton who could very well be the two best wings the Blazers have put next to Damian Lillard since Wesley Mathews (although Gary Trent Jr. might have something to say about that.) Covington and Jones Jr. both rate in the 80th percentile for blocks and steals and should fit perfectly into a Blazer’s defensive scheme that values smart rotations and playmaking from the wings. Also Stotts has said that the Blazers will have a much more versatile defense this year which is something to monitor, as they have tried out a zone a little bit during the preseason. Having Nurkic back will be huge as well as he is a lot more mobile than Whiteside and is one of the NBA’s better pick and roll defenders at the center position. If I had to make a prediction, I would say this Blazers defense goes from 26th in the league to somewhere between 9 and 15 (which isn’t unreasonable, as the Blazers have had a top ten defense within the past three years).

In addition to a now above-average defense, this team's offense should be nasty. At any point the Blazers should have two elite shooters on the floor: Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood (who was shooting 45% before an achilles took him out in December last year). The beauty of this rotation is that Hood or Trent are both capable of closing games at the three unless we are playing the Lakers, Clippers or any other team with dominating wing players. Throw in Robert Covington, Carmelo Anthony and Zach Collins, and even the Blazers “non-shooters” at the wing are still league average or above. Derrick Jones Jr. is the one guy who maybe doesn’t fit this billing but his shot has looked awesome during preseason and has been going in. I expect DJJ to be a good shooter this season from the corners, although the above-the-break shooting could still take some time. 

Lost in the midst of an extremely disappointing season was Damian Lillard’s career year. This was highlighted by two of the best scoring runs you will ever see from an NBA player. Once in the bubble and Once in late-January, early-February where he averaged 45 points and 10 assists over two weeks while shooting above 50% from outside (and still lost player of the month to LeBron, but I digress). Damian’s elevation to becoming one of the best offensive players in the NBA is, to me, the key ingredient in this Blazers team being a top three offense this year (which is where they were last year as well, astonishingly). One more thing to monitor is Dame extending his range even further, he has said that if he's feeling hot on a particular night, we should expect to see him pulling up from beyond half-court. That should be a treat.

In my opinion (as well as what I’ve gathered from hearing Olshey and Stotts talk about the team) the starting lineup should look like this: Lillard, McCollum, Jones Jr, Covington and Nurkic. I would expect the closing lineups most nights to be: Lillard, McCollum, Trent Jr., Covington and Nurkic. Rodney Hood, Carmelo Anthony, Zach Collins and one of Enes Kanter/Harry Giles all figure to be major pieces as well. Anfernee Simons has been referred to as our “backup point guard,” but I expect Stotts to stagger Dame and CJ making CJ the backup PG. I do think Simons will play on some nights, because the organization seems really committed to developing him. CJ Elleby, Nassir Little and Keljin Blevins (Dame’s cousin on a two-way) don’t really figure into the rotation much this year.

Overall, I think the combination of elite floor spacing, one of the best offensive players in the NBA, and the return of one of the leagues better screen and roll centers is enough to keep the Blazers as a top 3 offense. On defense, the Blazers did an amazing job of finding players suited to play in Stott’s scheme, and having Nurkic back should give us an above average defense (9-15).

To me, this equates to the Blazers being a 45 win team this year and getting home court advantage during the playoffs (although Denver, Utah, Dallas and Portland are all so close, that we could just as easily be the sixth seed).

In the playoffs, I think we could struggle, because although we have solid team defenders, we still lack elite one on one wing defense which becomes so valuable in the postseason. The Blazers could easily win a series, or even make a return to the WCF, but I have a hard time seeing Portland take down either of the LA teams.

**Season 1:** Just Batman for the first half of the season, introduce some key villans and characters. This is a Batman who has just comeback from training and just become Batman. Then in the second half introduce Dick Grayson robin. This season can be fairly child friendly.

**Season 2:** Just fullblown golden age Batman and Robin, have Harvey Dents decendent, introduce Scarecrow and a few other classics. Second half of the season introduce Batgirl. (If popular enough try to push for a Justice League spin off).

**Season 3:** Batman and Robin supported by Batgirl for half a season, with the second half slowly winding toward Robin leaving the role. If your show has built a strong following, begin pitching a Teen Titans show, if not just have Robin leave to Bludhaven at the end of the season.

**Season 4:** Batman gets Jason Todd strait away this season, but the first half of the season is consumed with the story of Jason struggling in the role. By the end of the season half Jason ""dies"" at the hands of the Joker. The second half is a dispondant Batman slowly rebuilding with Batgirl and Alfreds help. Your show begins to darken in tone.

**Season 5:** Batman is tracked down by Tim Drake and he becomes Robin at the start of season. End of mid season (Controversial bit now) Killing Joke happens, Babs becomes Oracle. Second half is more Batman and Robin with a slow intoduction of Steph as Batgirl.

**Season 6:** Batman and Robin continue to fight crime, Knightfall happens in first half, ending with Bruce overcoming Azreal and Bane. Second half focuses on introcuding Cass as black bat and Under the redhood (Jasons back baby).

**Season 7:** Damian is introduced and quickly becomes Robin, Battle for the cowl happens throughout a fair bit of Season first half. Dick and Damian spend half a season as Batman and Robin, ending with Bruce returning.

**Season 8:** (Miracle if you get this far lets be honest). Court of owls, I suppose?

I just want that story that grows and adapts, giving a definitive telling of the Batman mythos from start to finish, in one continuity, without the reboots and convoluted repositioning of characters. Just one continous story telling the story of Batman up to the present, evolving with its audience.

Just to give you some context on how well you have to be shooting to be a 50 40 90 guy in the playoffs, Steph Curry has never been 50-40-90 in the playoffs and he's only gotten close once in 2017, KD has only done it once in the playoffs in 2019 he got close in 2017, Ray Allen only did it once in the playoffs, Larry Bird has only done it once in his career. Reggie Miller, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard, and Steve Nash (who did it four times during the regular season in his career) have never shot 50-40-90 in the playoffs. The most recent guy to get close was Jamal Murray and in the Utah series, he was shooting 57% from the three and was shooting 73% from three in the clutch in the playoffs at one point ([x](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/iyl4jo/jamal_murray_is_shooting_73_from_three_in_clutch/)).

So I'm not gonna hold it against Khris that he couldn't continue shooting 50-40-90 in the playoffs from the regular season. He could've gotten his three-point percentage a little bit up this past season but his career playoff percentages are not that far off from guys like Dame and Klay.

&gt;Even in the Miami series Giannis had 9 assist in 2 games and 7 in another. He’s actually a good passer. Nobody else was doing anything.

You do realize Middleton averaged more points and assists than Giannis in the Miami series right?  Also, the game Milwaukee won was because of Middleton because Giannis got injured in the second quarter of Game 4, and Middleton was able to go off for 36. Middleton averaged 25 pts over the Miami series, I would hardly call that nothing. 

It's not so much Giannis's passing as that he needs to make better reads and make smarter plays during the game. To be fair to Giannis I think a lot of this problem stems from the fact that Kidd tried to make him a point guard, which he can't play. The reason a lot of guys Giannis's size don't make great point guards is 1) they're not great at handling the ball (which is not Giannis's problem and 2) they're not elite playmakers. Just because players can make passes doesn't mean they are the best playmakers. Guys like KD, AD, and Kawhi can all pass the ball, but none of them are elite playmakers and, there are only like a few guys (LeBron, Jokic, and Simmons) Giannis's size or bigger who have the court vision, basketball IQ and the elite playmaking skills to play like a point guard. 

When he's at the top of the key in the half-court because he's so limited offensively it's easy for teams to set their defenses up so that they 1) clog the lane so they take away his ability to drive or 2) force him into settling for tough shots or 3) get him to settle for threes. When Giannis finds himself in those situations a lot of time he just drives into the post and does a euro-step or a spin move and dunks over guys, but in the playoffs, he needs to vary his offense to be able to body guys in the post, hit his free throws when they try to hack him or pass the ball out to an open shooter like LeBron did to Danny Green at the end of game 5 ([x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YjvQe2RtXM)) or Butler is doing with Crowder ([x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2OCJCqslx4)) at 7:10. They drive have the defense collapse on them and then pass to an open shooter, even if they don't hit the shot like Danny Green it has a higher percentage to go in rather than trying to take on 3 or 4 guys all by yourself.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1607961204.0,,False,0.0,{},gftkc5q,False,t3_kc9u9f,False,,True,t1_gfsr751,/r/nba/comments/kc9u9f/shannon_what_does_giannis_need_to_do_to_win_a/gftkc5q/,1619025305.0,1.0,,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* Undisputed Era, Ciampa and Gargano definitely overstayed their welcome. I love UE and i am a big fan of Ciampa, Gargano is growing on me with this cheesy heel shtick, but they feel very stale. Seeing Ciampa &amp; Gargano on the main roster for that short time was awesome. I understand that they dont want to go to the main roster/cant handle the schedule or whatever, I feel like they have done everything there is to do in NXT. UE are definitely ready for the main roster, i see no reason for them not to be.
* Keith Lee was nowhere to be seen for a lot of time in NXT, then suddenly came back and they strapped a rocket to him and he flew on that rocket straight to the main roster. His time as champion was pretty much non-existent. I understand that he aint the youngest and they want to strike while the iron is hot, but i cant understand why he couldnt defend the belt/belts just once.
* I have similar complaints for Karrion Kross. They obviously have high expectations but he became champion wayyy too soon. He had a feud with Ciampa and went straight for Keith Lee. 
* Wrestling as a whole has this problem, but its critical that they reduce moves like dives and tope whatevers and find other ways to excite the audience. Damian Priest did 2 or 3 dives in a row on the recent War Games and i didnt even feel excited because ive seen dives on a regular basis since Neville/PAC was NXT champion. Its not special if its on every show.
* The Womens division is great and they are almost always a highlight of the show. Rhea Ripley is a megastar in the making and i feel like she is wasting her time in NXT, especially since the womens division is *STACKED.*
* The recent injuries of key people definitely play a role in the displeasure of certain fans. Kross got injured, Balor got injured, Ridge Holland got injured, Lumis got injured, Tegan Knox and now Candice after a huge win that would certainly put her in the Womens title picture.
* There seems to be a very noticeable gap in the Tag Team division, i feel like we only have 2 or 3 teams there.
* The big appeal of NXT was constant change of wrestlers, indie dream matchups and excitement of eventual main roster futures.

To be fair, most people would say barbara in burnside was basically stephs personality and batgirl type

&gt;, and I haven't heard what exactly holding that name would do for Steph and Cass that would make them any better than they are now, or than Bette or Barbara. 

for cass, her as orphan is no where near the level of prestige she had as batgirl. it’s like they regressed her from her first appearance. the name orphan also makes no sense 

for steph, spoiler is her identity when she was funded by her wallet and supplied by walmart. when she became batgirl it meant a lot. she proved herself a great batgirl just like all who came before her. she was a respected member of the bat family and was *batgirl*. i see steph as the embodiment of  resilience. she was always told by the bat family to go home and that she’s not good enough but she kept moving on and she reached titles like robin and then batgirl where she peaked. that’s not to say the other bat family or batgirls had it easy, they all had their own challenges and yes barbara got told to go home by bruce but he never meant it he was funding her batgirl adventures from the jump (post crisis). i could go on with countless examples about that

&gt; And though I respect what you're saying, I personally feel what you're describing nowadays as Oracle as a limited role. 'Tech support'. Yes, Babs is a master strategist, but she should be regarded as more as just acting as support for other heroes: where are her own rogues gallery? Her costumed identity? Her individual adventures

it’s only tech support if you look at it that way. when you read the stories you can really see why she is more than tech support. i can’t define it on a single paragraph but she’s a lot more. as oracle she does have her own adventures, rogues gallery etc just see birds of prey for a prominent example.

&gt;With how technology has progressed she can easily do both jobs on the go, setting up a remote database with which to catalogue information as she goes out to investigate by herself. That's the key aspect here: she might have limited mobility but she should not, as a paralysed hero, be restricted to 'desk duty.' Let her have the masks and the capes and the glitz and the showmanship as well as all the brains and strategising skills in the world. 

she can do this as oracle. just evolve the role

&gt;Why does Babs have to 'move on' from Batgirl, but it's somehow a step up for Cass and Steph rather than hold their own unique identities? 

cass can step up but black bat was never established so going back to batgirl is not much a regression and is definitely a step up from orphan. babs time as batgirl passed more than 30 years ago just like dick and jason have moved on. her as oracle is a progression over her as batgirl. steph is spoiler which is a step down from batgirl (she went from spoiler —-&gt; batgirl and developed as a character)

&gt;Why can't Orphan and Spoiler mean something just as much to Gotham and fans as Batgirl does? With the right direction they surely can.

because batgirl is batgirl. just like nightwing will never mean as much as batman no matter how much fans may want it.

batgirl is solely babs mantle. there have been 6 batgirls yet these three are the most prominent. cass was the first to have a batgirl solo remember? then steph. babs never had one before.

&gt;Batgirl means something: It's a persona that broke boundaries, stood for women's Lib in the 1970's, a self taught woman who never lost her sense of empathy or connection to people on a personal level, something which seems to get understated when Babs is stuck behind a screen. 

and cass and steph still carry on that meaning it didn’t go anywhere. also a lot of people don’t think that (that it’s understated by oracle). babs was more independent than ever as oracle if you look back at the stories.

&gt;You call her ""Babsgirl"", in what appears to be a derogatory manner: you do her a disservice and diminish what she's accomplished.

lmao sorry that came off offensive if it did, it isn’t meant to be derogatory as all it’s just a short way of typing barbara gordon batgirl every time. tons of people use it

&gt;Why should she have to share her identity? Why should it be depreciated so? It never worked for the Robins or the Nightwings; Duke had to move on, didn't he? 

well they’ve never tried it. duke was part of a gang of robins they aren’t actual robins and neither was duke. it doesn’t depreciate it at all or in any way.

&gt;How many fans were cheering the ""Fake Nightwings"" brutal slaughter for their 'one and only'? Hell, why couldn't he be Agent-37--that's pretty much a step up as Oracle was, right? ""You don't need a mask to be a superhero?"" 

i think you’re forgetting cass and steph are established batgirls. they are majority accepted as batgirls and have proven themselves time and time again. they have as much claim to the title as babs. also fans are cheering for steph and cass as batgirls so yh

if it was up to me dick would be batman that’s the biggest step up ever. but agent 37 was an undercover job not a superhero mantle.

&gt;Why aren’t Duke,Tim and Damian sharing the name? It's an unfair double-standard.

well duke was never robin and tim and damian do share the mantle just see all the death metal tie ins, damian is still robin. and i want tim to move on from robin anyways since he established himself as red robin which is a step up just like babs as oracle (for more than 30 years)

&gt;And plus, with how James Tynion is running things? What evidence do you have to suggest that he'll even let Barbara out from behind the screens? She could get shafted in all respects in having to share her identity and be an out-of-sight supporting figure for Cass and Steph's antics.

[],,,EldestGrump,1465294613.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yiywp,False,False,"&gt;Farmers have warned of “catastrophic” damage to British agriculture if Boris Johnson fails to secure a trade deal with Europe, after environment secretary George Eustice suggested that tariffs on foodstuffs would not be “manageable”.

&gt;National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said that no-deal Brexit would see tariffs as high as 85 per cent imposed on British beef and 62 per cent on lamb, pricing UK products out of the export market.

&gt;No-deal would cost the sector £1.36bn in new levies on exports, and would also impose “huge costs” on importers which are likely to be passed on to consumers in higher prices, she warned.

&gt;Meanwhile, a Conservative former cabinet minister said that food shortages were possible, as continental hauliers halt trips to the UK in order to avoid queues, disruption and Brexit red tape at the Channel ports.

&gt;“A lot of lorry drivers are saying they will just give Britain a miss for the first couple of months of next year,” said Damian Green, who was effective deputy prime minister in Theresa May’s government. “That could obviously lead to a threat of shortages of parts for manufacturing and even possibly of food and so on.”

&gt;Mr Eustice appeared to acknowledge the threat to agriculture as he tried to play down the potential impact of tariffs on the fisheries sector.

&gt;“When we’ve discussed this with the fishing industry, the main species we export, the levels of tariffs on fish - unlike agriculture actually - are manageable,” the environment secretary told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show.

&gt;Ms Batters said that Mr Eustice was right to suggest that tariffs would not be manageable for Britain’s farmers.

&gt;“We've been clear for four years now that a no-deal for agriculture is catastrophic,” she told BBC Radio 4’s World This Weekend.

&gt;“We (would be) priced out of the market. You’d be looking at enormous tariffs on every sector - 62 per cent on lamb, 85 per cent on beef, 51 per cent on malt and barley. It would be very savage and a total cost of £1.36 billion pounds in tariffs.”

&gt;Tariffs imposed on imports from the EU, which supplies 40 per cent of the UK’s food needs, would inflict “huge costs” to traders, she said, adding: “What does it do to food prices as well? It will be a very precarious position to be in.”

&gt;Even the kind of bare-bones free trade agreement being sought by Mr Johnson would cause difficulties for agriculture, because it would mean a mountain of new paperwork covering sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on animal and plant products.

&gt;With just 25 days to go until the transition to post-Brexit arrangements on 31 December, the UK faces massive shortages of the vets needed to carry out checks, with the threat of lengthy queues at the ports regardless of the outcome of Boris Johnson’s talks with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

&gt;“Farmers run long-term businesses, they want certainty,” said Ms Batters.

&gt;“They have no certainty on what our trading relationship is with our closest trading partner. I am besieged by by many people at the moment who want to know, but I can only plan for the worst and hope for the best.

&gt;“Time is really running out and, while we're living in this period, it's very hard to get final preparations in. We need 500% more vets. We have a lot of cost with the databases and everything else that has to go in - health checks, SPS rules at ports - and a month to prepare.”

&gt;With 7,000 trucks wanting to cross the Channel short straits at Dover at any one time, additional friction from red tape and paperwork will result in delays and additional cost, said Ms Batters.

&gt;“A thin deal doesn't necessarily mean that that everything is solved because you are still going to have friction,” she said. “That's the key point - we don't know how much friction, but it it it will have to be concluded at some stage. We have to have a trading relationship with the EU.”",True,False,,,,,0.0,1607277965.0,,False,0.0,{},geuqt68,False,t3_k7ygci,False,,False,t1_geupxrj,/r/brexit/comments/k7ygci/warning_of_catastrophic_nodeal_brexit_impact_on/geuqt68/,1618428803.0,16.0,,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He may be talented but he isn't just a floor-raiser, he's a ceiling-lowerer. The objective of the game is to win a championship, and signing Westbrook as a key piece just moves you further away from that.

&gt;if you put Westbrook on a team with decent-mediocre talent he can carry that team farther that almost anyone else in the league.

Is that true? He's been on some more than decent teams since KD left and the farthest he's been able to ""carry"" anyone was the 2nd round... except he was injured for (most? all? I don't remember) of round 1. So the furthest he's carried a team has been into the playoffs. That's not nothing but there are plenty of people who carried mediocre teams further, like Luke Doncic, Steph Curry (2013), LeBron James, Damian Lillard, James Harden last year, Anthony Davis (made it to round 2 of the playoffs on NOLA). And those are just players who have actually brought mediocre teams to the 2nd round off the top of my head. There's plenty more who are capable of it, like Jimmy Butler, Giannis, Chris Paul, KD. I could go on but I think I've demonstrated that there's actually quite a few players who can and/or have achieved more with similar talent or less.

All I'm saying is that what he's actually been able to achieve with these supposedly mediocre teams that had Victor Oladipo, Paul George, Sabonis, Schroeder, Steven Adams, etc. on them is a first round exit. Playing with Harden, an MVP caliber player in his prime, got him to the second round where they got crushed.

[],,,LJSavery,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4nbhnxhy,False,False,"Generally speaking, calisthenics is less efficient than weight lifting for muscle building. But your question depends on what experience you have prior to training. 

Calisthenics training is beneficial for wrestling because it will give you an essential type of strength that is indispensable. It is also a 'different' type of strength than weight lifting for lack of a better term. You will have better mobility, better control of your body and be able to perform basic movement patterns more efficiently. Calisthenics puts much greater emphasis on the use of stabiliser muscles and the use of isometrics.

When you start wrestling school, you may end up going to a school that makes you do military style, high volume calisthenics. These warmups are designed to strengthen you mentally. They are excessive in their volume for a reason. For the high volume, the best way to prepare is to use a method called 'greasing the groove', look it up. In terms of being in wrestling shape, unfortunately its a very specific type of conditioning. Many 'fit' people turn up on their first day and can't finish the warmup. Some vomit. I would say the best preparation would be to do the conditioning workouts on Damian Slater's YouTube channel. 

 If you have never trained before, then yes, calisthenics. I am of the opinion that one should learn how to lift their own weight before they lift external weights. It provides a much better foundation than the other way round. Especially because form is the most important aspect in all types of strength training, and it's much better to make the beginner mistakes on basic calisthenic movements than with hundreds of pounds on you. 

In terms of a program, I cannot recommend more the r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine. Read the FAQ, start from the beginning on all the progressions and do it properly. Run it using the gymanstic rings progressions, then switch to an intermediate routine like Body by Rings from FitnessFAQs. Gymnastic rings are amazing. Google search gymnasts and see how jacked those guys are. They are insanely strong. Gymnastic rings are a hidden fitness gem and translate incredibly well to pro wrestling. 

After you have finished the gymnastic rings program, then I would say go onto a novice strength focused lifting program. 5x5 or Starting Strength are both good. Again, form is key.

To me, this is like someone telling me that a Lebron-led team can't compete because the supporting cast isn't up to par. With the exception of his injured season last year, Steph has been top 2 in the league in PIPM (player impact plus minus) for every single season since 2013. The last two seasons where he was the unquestioned number 1 option he won the MVP, then he voluntarily took a step back to accommodate KD, and became a dynasty. Then, when KD went down, he still carried a battered team to the Finals.

I would look specifically at that 2019 run, when considering how much of a supporting cast Steph needs around him to compete. When KD went down, he did still have Klay and Dray, but the rest of that roster was bad. After KD went down, they had guys like Alfonzo McKinnie, Jordan Bell, Damian Jones, the ghost of Andrew Bogut and the remaining shell of DeMarcus Cousins all start playoff games for them. And, they still swept 6 straight games to win the West. This was a team where Quinn Cook was a key secondary scoring option for them in the Finals. Steph has managed with poor supporting casts before, so I am a little less concerned than I otherwise would be.

This year's supporting cast has some question marks, for sure, but Steph has a hell of a history of elevating his teams. He won more regular season games next to Klay and Dray then MJ won next to Pippen and Rodman, more than LeBron won next to Wade and Bosh, and more than Magic won with Kareem and Worthy. As much as I like Klay, I'm not going to bet on his loss being a big enough blow to stop Steph from snagging a top 4 seed now.

Lesser stars than Steph, like Harden and Jokic, have landed top 4 seeds in the West with injury ravaged supporting casts that they had to hard-carry (2018-2019 for both of them), so I think that's a reasonable bar to set. Whether Steph can beat the Lakers in a playoff series is another issue, but topping teams like the Jazz, Blazers and Suns in the regular season standings doesn't seem like an unrealistic expectation at all.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1605811928.0,,False,0.0,{},gcuu9ib,True,t3_jx6srm,False,,False,t1_gcunmlw,/r/nbadiscussion/comments/jx6srm/if_klay_is_out_what_is_the_next_move_for_the/gcuu9ib/,1617208409.0,21.0,,True,False,nbadiscussion,t5_3cw3x,r/nbadiscussion,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Why is Azreal an issue?**

Azreal represents what WG did long ago: A complete shift in the way by which people play the game. While I consider myself a dolphin of sorts, I'm fully aware many people don't shovel in the money I do. Many do not have the capability to simply ""Bring x and y to g11 to answer this character"". To insist that he is not overpowered simply because answers exist is a bit disingenuous to a majority of players, and dismissive in a general sense to the genuine plight of people being unable to supply said answer in a practical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that being said, one must also keep in mind that unlike WG, Azreal doesn't decrease design space. WG outright removed the capability to run buff-focused comps, and in many ways still does, while also being terrific at multiple other roles. Azreal is a beatstick, similar to Arkkis but more oppressive when not accounted for. The key word here is ""when not accounted for"". You can have an answer for him without needing to specifically dedicate multiple team slots towards it. He still suffers from the same issues that any other softer character in his position does: once you shut him off, he doesn't tend to turn back on again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Removing Debuff immunity, and substantial change**

I was actually speaking with Hatemael and Loot on the subject, and I feel like a nerf wouldn't actually solve most of the issues people have with the character. Let's take, as an example, removing the debuff immunity entirely from his kit. Seems like a slam-dunk adjustment that many people have suggested and requested, but outside of providing 1 or 2 more answers, what would it solve? The same people who can't kill him because they can't reach him still can't, the same people not having issues with the character still won't. He would still be as susceptible to Kilowog turn 1 stun, to Red Robin + Arkkis combo, to Firestorm omeganuke, to Star Sapphire AoE buff immunity when accelerated, so on. What it would solve is being to answer him later, to stop him once he's ramped, but by that point the match is pretty much lost. It would remove a lot of his clutch potential, but his clutch potential isn't really why he is an issue. It would weaken him, but not in any substantial way that would make his highs any less high.

&amp;#x200B;

**Removing shielding, a consideration for balance**

Of course the question comes: How should one nerf him, if at all? I'm personally against nerfing unless the character limits the potential for later characters down the line, since that actively hurts the games longevity. Azreal doesn't do that any more than any other high-output character, and he certainly isn't alone in the ""If you don't deal with it early it's an issue"" role. Still, if a change had to be made which would be substantial enough to fix the issues fighting into him without making him a functionally different character, it would be better served removing his shielding than the debuff immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

By removing his shielding, you open a new weakness to collateral damage, and at the same time keep his core kit more or less the same. You remove the issue of ""Well he just doesn't die"" and it becomes a shared timer type game. You have to eliminate him before he eliminates you. You, as the active player, can still build with shielding and such in mind, you can artificially improve his survivability, so he wouldn't change that much when controlling him outside of being a bit softer. As a player fighting in, he becomes a target you can wear down passively, meaning things like bleeds stick that little bit more and counter attacks become that bit more dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game of answers and obstacles**

Now we have to consider why the question is a bit frustrating to people seeing it. The game is currently sitting at about 120 characters and growing. Within these characters, answers aren't quite as specific as many people might believe: A lot of openly available characters are answers to Azreal. Likewise, it's not difficult to play around Azreal to get results you want, but it's the issue that you have to consider using that different playstyle and not many people do. At one point, to prove a point, I showcased that one could make Grundy (72 speed) go before Damian Wayne (Robin, 130 speed) using a Lex team without even once triggering Azreal. The implications of this is that with proper support, there's not really any limit on who can and can't be an answer, provided you pursue getting those options. 

Put another way, if you only ever used bleed characters, someone like Hal might seem OP. We can't nerf Hal because people opt to not use the answers available and on offer, Azreal is much of the same. While it's not proper to say ""He isn't overpowered because answers exist"", it's equally improper to say ""He is overpowered"" when answers are available to any player for free. You can't really have both sides be right, and unfortunately, it's the nature of the game that the answers being available is the dominant factor in it all. If you can't answer him now, you will be able to eventually. That's just how progression works. As it happens, most players have the answers already, they just haven't considered how to use those characters in a way that allows them to get around Azreal. 

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**

Azreal isn't OP, but he does force people to adjust how they play and pursue other answers than what they might've been inclined to before. If you can't counter him now, then you will be able to eventually. He's a strong example of the need to invest in a wider range of toons, including support options that might not fit the usual compositions people are used to. If you did have to nerf him, however, removing his shield would be the best way to do it while keeping his kit intact.

In the battle of the next-generation gaming machines, two key players are moving in different directions.

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft Corp. is making a serious attempt to attract fans in Japan with its new consoles and network services. Meanwhile, Tokyo-based Sony Corp. moved its PlayStation business headquarters to California in 2016 and has built the U.S. into its largest single market.

&amp;#x200B;

New Xbox and PlayStation devices launching this week will likely face an uphill battle in Japan, where Nintendo Co.’s Switch enjoys dominance with a family-friendly lineup of games.

&amp;#x200B;

But Microsoft’s targeting of the world’s third-largest video-game market -- including with services that can be accessed across a variety of devices -- could potentially yield strong results. As the Xbox has virtually zero presence in the country, there’s plenty of room for it to increase its share.

&amp;#x200B;

“The Xbox has a chance to make Japan its second-largest market after the U.S. if it takes the right steps for years to come,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Sony’s attention is drifting away and fans have started to notice that.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sony has placed more importance on the U.S. market after the PlayStation 4’s disappointing performance in Japan, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.

Sony’s PlayStation 5 Is Beating Xbox in the Online Black Market

&amp;#x200B;

Global sales of the PS4 rose to more than 113 million from the PS3’s 87 million, according to Sony data. But the console sold fewer than 10 million units in Japan, less than its predecessor, according to Famitsu, a Japanese video-game magazine. The U.S., meanwhile, accounts for 35% of the video-game unit’s revenue, compared with 10% for Japan, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. analyst Damian Thong.

Any suggestion that Sony is shifting its focus away from Japan is incorrect and doesn’t reflect the company’s strategy, spokeswoman Natsumi Atarashi said. She noted that the PlayStation 5 is launching first in Japan and said “our home market remains of utmost importance.”

&amp;#x200B;

Sony's rivalry with Microsoft spills over into the stock market

A senior figure inside PlayStation headquarters in San Mateo, California, said the U.S. side was frustrated by the failure of the Japan marketing team to sell as many PlayStation 4 units as expected. The person asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, Japan has been sidelined in planning the PlayStation 5’s promotion, according to several PlayStation staff in Japan. Employees in Tokyo said they’ve been left awaiting instructions from California.

&amp;#x200B;

Japan-based developer support teams have been reduced by as much as a third from their peak, and the rolling contracts of a number of game creators at PlayStation’s Japan Studio, one of the unit’s oldest in-house software ateliers, haven’t been renewed, former employees said. The U.S. office believes the PlayStation business doesn’t need games that only do well in Japan, employees in the California headquarters said.

Sony Surges After Increase in Forecast on Gaming Demand

&amp;#x200B;

The PlayStation 5’s two main online promotional events both took place at 5 a.m. in Tokyo -- making them more accessible to American and European fans -- and lacked Japanese translation for some parts. The company also decided to standardize its PS5 control scheme so that Japanese players would have to use X to confirm and O to cancel, like the rest of the world. That reverses a 26-year tradition in a country where circles signify positives and crosses mark negatives.

Local retailers said they haven’t received many more first-batch PlayStation 5 units than they did of the PlayStation 3, which had a limited initial production run.

&amp;#x200B;

“It’s analyst consensus that PlayStation no longer sees the Japan market as important,” Morningstar Research analyst Kazunori Ito said. “If you want to know their take on the Japanese market, you need to ask about it because otherwise Sony wouldn’t talk about it.”

&amp;#x200B;

TV ownership among Japanese households has been falling for years, according to government data. That makes the market less attractive, according to Ace’s Yasuda. In order to play games on the PlayStation, a user must have a TV or monitor, though some titles are also available to play on PCs.

&amp;#x200B;

Serkan Toto, a game consultant in Tokyo, said the PlayStation 5 should sell fewer units than its predecessor.

&amp;#x200B;

“Many PlayStation 4 owners in Japan would eventually move to the PlayStation 5, but that would largely depend on how strong the PlayStation team in Tokyo will be in pushing the needs of Japanese customers to the American headquarters,” he said. “Considering the current power balance between the U.S. and Japan, I can’t expect much, unfortunately.”

&amp;#x200B;

To be sure, the PlayStation 4’s worldwide success suggests Sony’s strategy hasn’t been detrimental. Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said on Oct. 28 that the company would be able to sell more than 7.6 million PlayStation 5 units in the first five months, more than the popular PlayStation 4 achieved in the same timeframe. The long-term goal is to sell as many units as the PS4, Totoki said.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of wish I grew up in the UK sometimes. So much incredible art is produced there and genuine stretches of music in all styles. Malcolm McLaren and others like him don't get the notoriety that's due for making genres genuinely international. Nile Rodgers talks about working with David Bowie on his Lets Dance album, and how music is presented and appreciated in the UK.

Kind of makes me wonder if it's a class-based thing like it is here, or if there's a general sense of respect and admiration for those choosing those pursuits. I'm probably overanalyzing but in my experience, artistic professions are generally frowned upon here in the States if you're from a working-class as I was when I was a kid.

[],,,bowser2bowser,1550955532.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2mzz6wbh,False,False,"I agree with everything you're saying about Hayes. He's not my pick overall. He's my pick among the 4 other combo guards mentioned.

1. Hayes's C&amp;S numbers are bad -- and Hampton's and Maxey's are just as bad, if not worse (Haliburton's are good, but his form is very slow, and he seems to have less upside). I think this question is a good one because there's not an obviously right answer. I even changed my answer a bit as I was writing.
2. He's one of the youngest players in the draft, and so it's going to take time to adjust to his role no matter what it is. I feel like in the short term, at the very least, he could be the PG for the \~15-18mpg Trae is on the bench. If they play just 8mpg together, that brings his mpg to the same point SGA/Coby White had as rookies (a lot more than Jamal Murray/Kris Dunn/Ntilikina had). 
3. Very valid concern. Maxey's and Hampton's are worse. Once again, Haliburton has better stats, and I think that's a sign he'll be solid, but it's not a guarantee of greatness or even worthiness of top-6 pick. Monte Morris (a fellow ISU guard) had a great ast/TO ratio, and so did Jalen Brunson. Halliburton to me seems to have more upside than those two, but plainly, Haliburton is the oldest of the bunch, and so you hope he has the best decision making.
4. Yeah, he's not Matisse or Marcus Smart. If we want that, Okoro is the pick, not Hayes 

I wouldn't worry so much about fit on a team this young and inexperienced. And I think the fit would actually be surprisingly better than at first glance. If I had my way (if we *had* to choose among these 4), we wouldn't be drafting Hayes to be a SG. We would be drafting Hayes so that *Trae* could be a SG for \~10 minutes per night. In this scenario, Hayes plays the 15-18mpg at PG while Trae sits, and 10mpg at PG while Trae plays off ball like Steph or Seth Curry. Doncic's size (an inch taller than Hayes) allows Seth Curry to focus on shooting and scoring. Hell, even Damian Lillard moves to off ball a lot in their mover/blocker offense, and the Lakers also move LeBron from on ball to off ball later in the game; he'll start at PG, but he play some minutes off ball while Rondo plays PG. 

I really think the key to unlocking this team is enabling Trae to play more off ball. But we need a better ballhandler to pull that off. 

As for Cam, he's my favorite player and I wouldn't dream of stunting his growth. I don't see him as a primary initiator, though. I see him as a Tatum type, and Tatum is only helped by the presence of Kemba, not hurt. The fact that Cam played PG in high school is evidence of his upside, not proof that he'd be out of position playing anywhere else. Lots of good players play PG in high school because they're the best ballhandler on the team. 

If anything, Cam would have the ball more with Trae and Hayes than he did in college, when he was the 4th option. In my scenario, he'd be the 2nd or 3rd option, which is best suited for him at this point in his career.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1604247661.0,,False,0.0,{},gasxzle,False,t3_jkpnal,False,,False,t1_gapl94r,/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/jkpnal/how_do_you_rank_these_combo_guards/gasxzle/,1615945534.0,1.0,,True,False,AtlantaHawks,t5_2sgwl,r/AtlantaHawks,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,,Fly1ngsauc3r,,,,[],,,,text,t2_71f2zsps,False,False,"This closeness to his players is at the heart of his success and few could claim to get so much out of their resources. Even more telling is that “practically none of the players that Mendilibar has discarded have managed to succeed in LaLiga,” says Letizia Gómez, who covers Eibar for *Diario Vasco.* Pedro León perhaps raised eyebrows by joining Eibar, given his illustrious past and technical quality. Yet he is just one of many players who have found their most consistent form with the *azulgrana*. “\[Mendilibar\] knows how to get the best out of his players, especially when things aren’t looking good,” assures Gómez, who has witnessed Mendilibar at a proximity that few have. 

It’s that ephemeral ability to convince players of your methods, to achieve their complete trust which is at the heart of such a sustained period of performance. According to Gómez, “he believes a lot in his idea and ensures that his players believe in it too. He has the capacity to unite the group so that everyone is working as one, with him and with his style.” In Mendilibar’s own words, nothing extraordinary, but an insistence on what they do well. 

The likes of Joan Jordán, Ander Capa, Rubén Peña and Marc Cucurella can all claim to be amongst the best in Spain in their position currently, all of whom were transformed by the 59-year-old. All, and plenty more, have left for shiny new pastures. Inui, perhaps one of Eibar’s best ever players, earned a move to [Real Betis](https://www.laligalowdown.com/post/sergio-canales-the-man-who-never-gave-up) and came back via a loan at Alavés, but he’s one of the few ‘stars’ still there.

The aforementioned tightening of margins is a consequence of the loss of key and quality players year on year. The bleeding of talent is natural given the size of the club, but Mendilibar’s powers of extraction will have a limit. An average of four starting players, in many cases the cream of their crop, have left each summer since 2016. This year top-scorer Charles (nine) and the next top scorer Fabián Orellana (eight) were part of the exodus, from a side that didn’t have an abundance of goals to lose. 

Unheralded as Mendilibar is, his sporting director Fran Garagarza receives even less press. Dubbed “the Basque Monchi” by McTear, there is no higher praise in that area of expertise. He’s been instrumental in imparting fresh blood each year. Garagarza’s ability to pan for gold and strike rich is remarkable. “I have faith in the Mendilibar-Garagarza tandem,” adds McTear. 

Yet this year’s new recruits do seem a little underwhelming and in contrast to [Monchi](https://www.laligalowdown.com/podcast/episode/2f5ce1c5/monchi-from-backup-goalkeeper-to-the-worlds-top-sporting-director) or others, a down year for Garagarza quite probably means going down for Eibar. Restricted by the alternate universe we find ourselves in at the moment, where doubt creeps in for McTear is at full-back, a position he feels is crucial to Mendilibar’s style but for two years has seen no quality additions. 

Equally, Yoshinori Muto was brought in to reinforce the forward line, but his goal record is not something which should be prompting his signing. The ‘big-money’ attacking addition Damian Kądzior, who comes with a better record, is yet to do his own convincing of Mendilibar, having not played a full 90 minutes yet. 

As with all things financial, it’s the smallest people who lose the least but will be the most affected by this year’s pandemic. The odds are stacked against Eibar this season – more so than they already were. Still, if there is anyone in the world equipped to achieve the miracle of survival, it’s Mendilibar. No current manager in LaLiga plays the game, not the occasion, as much he does, his methods divorced from how a team that size should look. If Eibar are relegated, it’s a return to reality. If they stay up, whatever he may think, Eibar will be doing something extraordinary yet again.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1603805989.0,,False,0.0,{},ga9rkkt,True,t3_jj194v,False,,True,t1_ga9rk21,/r/soccer/comments/jj194v/josé_luis_mendilibar_the_miracle_worker/ga9rkkt/,1615613291.0,3.0,,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He played 3 college games, only one against good competition. 

I didn't say all he *could* be, I said it's all we've seen. We haven't seen him have a handle, vision, passing, the key traits the Warriors would want out of a center who they'd pick top 3. 

I've seen him be very long and athletic and out physical some limited college competition in some very limited games. 

You can look at his physical attributes and project all kinds of crazy comparables but let's be real. We've seen him play in 3 college games only and only one of these teams had really quality talent on it. He played well in those limited games but showed the most basic skills for a big and totally relied on his physical advantage to be effective, not his skill. 

Maybe 5 years from now Wiseman will be scoring 30 points a night, grabbing 10 boards, shoot it like Dirk, rebound like Rodman, vision like Lonzo, BBIQ like Draymond, and provide rim defense like Gobert but we haven't seen it.

A guy like Wiseman is only projected top five because of a confluence of factors. 

This draft is seen as especially weak at the top end. There are several players who teams like but not really many standouts, obvious top five picks. 

Wiseman is very young, declared at 18 and will be 19 when drafted. 

He has probably the best physical tools in this draft, height, wingspan and athleticism. You know another 7' center who had good physical tools? We drafted him, Damian Jones. He's only just *now* looking like he might be able to give an NBA team limited rotation minutes off the bench and not be a net negative. 

Wiseman isn't Jones, I'm merely saying that Wiseman **IS** a crapshoot. Lots of potential upside, could also be the type of player who never earns much more than a minimum deal his entire career. Young, highly touted prospects have flamed out before. 

If he had shown a gift for playmaking, OK, Kerr's system loves to use big men to pass out of the post.

&gt;Overseas borrowers have flocked to the dollar this year at a record pace, with sovereigns from Indonesia to Colombia and companies from Nissan Motor Co. to Manila’s water utility racking up sales of $1.29 trillion.

&gt;It’s a key economic takeaway from the Covid-19 crisis: just as happened in the wake of the global financial meltdown of 2008, the dollar is cementing its role as the world’s dominant currency even as unilateralist policies from President Donald Trump rile allies and rivals alike.

&gt;“Whenever there is a crisis, companies and countries rush to make sure they have all the funding they need,” said Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist who coined the BRIC acronym.

&gt;“The dollar markets are the only real source available, so the whole situation builds on itself,” according to O’Neill, who is chair of the international policy group Chatham House.

&gt;The ease of borrowing in dollars across the globe has been key in preventing the health and economic crisis spiraling into a financial one by providing companies and governments cheap access to funds. But it may also be sowing seeds for the next crisis: If the greenback sees a sustained appreciation trend, it will drive up debt-servicing costs, potentially creating, for some, repayment difficulties down the road.

&gt;That’s a particular risk for emerging markets, where external debt including dollar borrowing is climbing at the fastest pace on record, with full-year issuance on track to eclipse $750 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Damian Sassower.

&gt;For now, the dollar’s been moving in the right direction. The Bloomberg dollar index has plunged about 10.5% from its 2020 high reached on March 23.

&gt;A lack of global alternatives helps explain some of the dollar’s role. The euro’s status as a reserve currency remains limited, and China’s currency is still subject to capital controls.

&gt;It’s also a function of cost. With the Federal Reserve unleashing massive liquidity, and now expected to keep interest rates near zero for years to come, the greenback is all the more attractive as a funding source.

&gt;Easier Fed policy helped the Philippines sell sovereign dollar debt at its lowest interest rate ever back in April. The dollar is the “universal currency” and the unit of global trade, according to Rosalia de Leon, treasurer of the Philippines, who says her country will continue to rely on the greenback to help fund its budget deficit.

&gt;Philippine and Indonesian companies have each sold more dollar bonds in 2020 than in any past full year.

&gt;“The domestic financial market is not yet deep” in Indonesia, said Deni Ridwan, director of sovereign bonds at the nation’s Finance Ministry. By selling debt in dollars, Indonesia’s government can avoid crowding out local rupiah issuers, he explained.

&gt;For Nissan, the Japanese carmaker struggling to bounce back from both corporate scandals and the Covid crisis, the broad base of international investors was appealing when it turned to the dollar debt market for the first time in decades. It priced an $8 billion dollar offering in September, one of the largest corporate issues in Asia on record, as well as a 2 billion euro deal ($2.4 billion).

&gt;The total issuance of $1.29 trillion from non-U.S. borrowers this year is up 21% from the same period of 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

&gt;The record boom in offshore dollar bond sales has been echoed on the U.S. domestic front. Behind it all: the Fed not only cut its policy rate near zero in March, it introduced corporate-debt purchase programs that helped ensure the flow of credit even as coronavirus lockdowns walloped the economy.

&gt;The Fed also enlarged and expanded swap lines with monetary authorities around the world to address a sudden shortage of dollars abroad.

&gt;The critical role of the U.S. currency also has a downside, however -- it leaves emerging markets reliant on American policy settings. While it seems distant now, Fed tightening down the road could spur dollar appreciation.

&gt;“The extensive dependence on the dollar leaves the international financial system hostage to the whims of U.S. policies, especially those of the Federal Reserve,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team, and is now at Cornell University. “For emerging market economies, in particular, it can create whiplash effects on capital flows and exchange rates.”

&gt;While other major bond markets are seeing a bumper year too -- Europe’s primary bond market has surpassed 1.5 trillion euros of annual sales for the first time -- when issuers do go offshore to borrow, it’s still likely to be in dollars.

&gt;Even as the share of dollar funding relative to the size of the global economy remains below its peak of a decade ago, its slice of international borrowing has climbed to a two-decade high, Bank for International Settlements data show. “It is clearly the dominant international funding currency,” the BIS wrote in a June report.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1603551137.0,,False,0.0,{},g9wzjuq,False,t3_jh8bot,False,,False,t3_jh8bot,/r/Economics/comments/jh8bot/fed_cements_dollar_dominance_fueling_record/g9wzjuq/,1615393997.0,14.0,,True,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,r/Economics,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&gt;*Judges, top silks and legal academics have urged caution for Victorians looking to join hotel quarantine class actions launched against the Andrews government, saying they are unlikely to succeed.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The class actions, which are often spruiked as being worth billions, are among a barrage of lawsuits faced by the state government over its response to the coronavirus pandemic.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In all, there are at least 11 separate actions in Victoria related to COVID-19 losses, eight of which are being pursued against the Andrews government.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Of those, two major class action lawsuits have been lodged against the government and senior ministers in an attempt to hold them responsible for retrenchments and financial damage caused by the imposition of lockdown measures to combat the spread of coronavirus.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The legal bids allege that the Andrews government’s mismanagement of the hotel quarantine scheme amounts to negligence, claiming that when COVID-19 escaped the hotels and infected people within the broader community, the resulting lockdown to drive down transmission, and the economic damage it caused, was foreseeable and the government’s fault.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Barrister Lachlan Armstrong, QC, who has practised in class actions for 25 years and was involved in all six Black Saturday bushfire class actions, said the cases would inevitably be drawn into an analysis of government policy and could fail on that basis.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Courts tend to take the view that governments are elected to make decisions on behalf of the community,” he said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“And when it comes to decisions about the allocations of public resources or policy responses to crisis, those are political decisions that should be left to the ballot box.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“The courts are reluctant to try to put themselves in the shoes of public health officials or ministers in determining how government powers should be exercised.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Mr Armstrong said if a government was held responsible for this kind of policy response, it would be difficult for the court to ""draw a line"" regarding where their liability would end.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“If the argument is that the relevant state government actor, when making decisions about how to run the hotel quarantine program, should have foreseen that the wrong decision could result in an outbreak leading to lockdown restrictions, leading to an impact on particular businesses, then why would you stop at those businesses?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Why would the impact on the businesses employees not be foreseeable? If the business can’t pay its rent, why not the impact on the landlord?”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Mr Armstrong said another issue was that the cases claim “pure” economic losses, meaning financial losses not resulting from personal injuries or property damage such as a business premises being burnt down.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“The reasons for the court’s and law’s traditional reluctance to compensate for pure economic loss is where does the liability stop,” he said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“I think the general public hears about class actions that are high profile, high value, and often hears most about them when the big ones settle. That tends to create an impression that every class action is a strong prospect.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“People shouldn’t be organising their affairs on any assumption that these cases will result in pots of gold.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Former Federal Court judge Ray Finkelstein, who has worked on and adjudicated class actions when he was on the bench, said the claims could succeed but carry real risks.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“From the claimants' perspective, the claims have prospects of success but could be described as involving real, and known, risks,” he said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Mr Finkelstein said that cases hinge on two key factors: does the government owe a legal duty of care to the plaintiffs, which he thinks at present they do not, and whether the number of people who have the right to compensation can be defined.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Here the important issue is whether the ‘indeterminacy’ factor will be a stumbling block. The indeterminacy arises at two levels: the nature of the class (all people in Victoria) and the nature of the loss (pure economic loss).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“In each of these areas indeterminacy could be a real barrier to success. In part this is because each area is still legally unsettled.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Documents filed in the Supreme Court in August claim the government acted negligently because it failed to ensure that hotel security guards had access to and knew how to use personal protective equipment, and that they weren’t adequately trained to protect against the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 from returned travellers.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The two cases say that anyone retrenched in Victoria, or whose Victorian business has lost revenue due to the lockdowns, may be eligible for compensation, and lists Victorian Jobs Minister Martin Pakula and former health minister Jenny Mikakos, and their department secretaries, as defendants.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Damian Scattini, a partner at Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart &amp; Sullivan who is managing the business class action, said his litigation would not be drawn into challenging government policy.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""We’re not criticising the government for the hard lockdown – that policy is a matter for them and it’s not our place to criticise. But if you do hotel quarantine, you best do it reasonably competently, or you’ll be called to account,"" he said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Managing partner of Carbone Lawyers, Tony Carbone, who is managing the litigation on behalf of retrenched workers, said the decision by the Victorian government to forgo using Australian Defence Force personnel to guard hotels amounted to gross negligence.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""The whole decision-making around hotel quarantine was totally flawed. It was an arbitrary decision, a very poor one. Botched is not the word – shambolic is the way to describe it,"" he said, ""I’ve got people that are suicidal, I’ve got people that are destitute.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Melbourne Law School lecturer Brad Jessup agreed with statements urging caution, saying courts have historically found that the government doesn’t have a duty of care in situations where people have incurred financial losses due to policy decisions.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“If you lose your house, that’s something they prioritise more than losing your income,” he said.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“For good or bad, sometimes the law is used as a tool for putting pressure on the government to change policy or to do something.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dr Jessup said it was worth distinguishing between the “hopeless” cases brought against the Andrews government on the one hand, and the “hopeful” cases brought against aged care facilities St Basil’s Home for the Aged and Epping Gardens Aged Care that were accused of negligence.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*He also said that estimates of billion-dollar damages being awarded by the court would not approach that amount.*",True,False,,,,,0.0,1603407409.0,,False,0.0,{},g9p8hvh,True,t3_jganyc,False,,False,t3_jganyc,/r/auslaw/comments/jganyc/the_age_judges_top_silks_and_legal_academics_urge/g9p8hvh/,1615257993.0,5.0,,True,False,auslaw,t5_2stjv,r/auslaw,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cleveland- Yes, the Cavs won the title in 2016, but they have declined since LeBron left (Thanks a lot, JR Smith). Also, before drafting LeBron in 2003, they didn't even make a single NBA Finals appearance. Indians haven't won WS since 1948. Browns are a factory of sadness (The Drive, Red Right 88, The Fumble, The Move, Bottlegate, Tim Couch, that infamous QB jersey, Johnny Manziel, 0-16, Hue Jackson). And even if you cheated and included Columbus, then you'll add the Blue Jackets, who didn't win a playoff series in their entire history until 2019. 

Orlando- Sorry Orlando, but Tampa Bay teams do not count. Hence, you can't access the Lightning's two cups and the Bucs' token SB win. Instead, you get the Magic...who have ZERO championships, and can only watch with grief as their two best big men (Shaq and Dwight) became champions...in Los Angeles. Y'all better hope Vucevic and Gordon don't leave. Orlando City is worse, as they have never qualified for the playoffs throughout their existence. 

Ottawa- Senators owner is a P.O.S., and the team isn't that good right now. Zero Stanley Cups. Karlsson is in San Jose. Made a big trade for Duchene that failed spectacularly and unwittingly turned the Avalanche into contenders. Have to compete for attention with the Habs and Leafs. 

Jacksonville- Even worse than Orlando. The only significant pro team is the Jacksonville Jaguars...who are a walking NFL punchline. Zero championships. Zero Hall of Famers in their history (at least, until Boselli gets in someday). Bore witness to the mediocrity of Blaine Gabbert and Blake Bortles. Just lost key pieces such as Ngakoue, Campbell, and Ramsey. Are only relevant because of Jason Mendoza in The Good Place. Many joke that they'll be moved to London someday. 

San Jose- Kinda cheating a bit, since SJ is part of the Bay Area, which boasts of the Warriors, 49ers, Giants, and A's, which have all won titles in their history and have been competitive recently. But if you look at San Jose by itself...sheesh. The Sharks have a lot of playoff appearances and a Cup Final appearance, but have never won the Cup. The Quakes did win a title...in 2001. Now, they're far from a title contender. San Jose State, as much as it hurts for me to say as an Undergrad alumnus, is a bit of a joke in major college sports, and is overshadowed by the likes of Cal Berkeley (my Grad school Alma Mater) and Stanford. 

Sacramento- Probably a better example than SJ, since they're farther from the SF Bay. Only pro team is the Sacramento Kings...and they SUUUUCK. Had one good period with Webber and Divac, and they couldn't get past the Lakers (thanks a lot, Tim Donaghy). They had Boogie Cousins...but they traded him. Selected Jimmer Fredette over Klay Thompson and Kawhi Leonard. Selected Thomas Robinson over Damian Lillard and Draymond Green. They better hope Fox, Hield, and Bagley develop into solid pros. 

Winnipeg- The original Jets never won the Stanley Cup, despite having the likes of Dale Hawerchuk (R.I.P.), Keith Tkachuk, Thomas Steen, Teemu Selanne, and Teppo Numminen. Then they moved to Arizona in 1996, where they....continued to suck (Fun fact: the Jets 1.0/Coyotes franchise has the worst all-time record in the NHL). Flash forward to 2011, and the Jets name was revived thanks to the Atlanta Thrashers' failure and subsequent move to Manitoba. The new Jets have reached the playoffs, but haven't exactly set the NHL alight, despite having had guys like Dustin Byfuglien,　Andrew Ladd, Bryan Little, Blake Wheeler, Evander Kane, Patrik Laine, Mark Scheifele, and Connor Hellebuyck. 

Salt Lake City- Ok, so the Jazz have Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. And they had Stockton and Malone in the 90's. How many championships do they have? ZERO. Real Salt Lake won a title...but that was ten or so years ago. 

Anaheim- In a similar situation to San Jose and the Bay Area, this could be cheating a bit since Anaheim is close to LA (which means, they're close to powerhouses such as the Lakers and Dodgers). Also, the Ducks and Angels each won a title in the 2000's.   However, recent history has been unkind to them. The Ducks have fallen out of the playoff picture as of late, as stars like Getzlaf get older. The Angels have Mike Trout...and have absolutely wasted his prime by underperforming spectacularly over the last decade.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1603263369.0,,False,0.0,{},g9ioywj,False,t3_jf38ov,False,,True,t3_jf38ov,/r/theloudhouse/comments/jf38ov/the_state_of_detroit_sports_from_2016present_a/g9ioywj/,1615146056.0,1.0,,True,False,theloudhouse,t5_39wzf,r/theloudhouse,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[],,,HecticEpic,1368419403.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_bnod9,False,False,"So tough to choose. I put Daniel first, Smith second. But then I really find it hard to separate Franklin, Lock, and Gabbert. 

For Franklin, the numbers don't do him justice. A lot of anecdotes to choose from (game-clinching TD against #1 OU as a freshman, willing the team to 8 wins as a sophomore, playing well when healthy his junior and senior years), but the one I always go back to is the Cotton Bowl his senior year. He was absolutely terrible in the second half, one of the worst performances of his career. It looks like Mizzou Athletics deleted all its archives so I can't find the quote from the press conference, but one of the receivers, I think L'damian Washington, said something along the lines of ""In the fourth quarter we all trusted our quarterback would make the plays to get us in position to win."" And down the stretch, Franklin made some key throws to set up the game-winning TD drive. The fact that he was playing so awfully and still had the trust of his teammates I think speaks volumes about how he was a fantastic leader for that 2013 team (and of course, a phenomenal quarterback for most of that year too).

For Lock, my biggest regret is how little I appreciated him while he was here. Of course I liked him and thought he was good but I also definitely kept in mind that most of his incredible stats were racked up against not-so-great teams. It wasn't until 2019 that I realized his impact, because without him that offense fell apart. Pretty much all of his supporting cast from 2018 returned in 2019, which created a perfect natural experiment. Going back to watch 2017 and 2018 especially now, I can see how he made every single person around him on that offense better.  He made throws that by his junior and senior years seemed ho-hum and didn't impress me because I'd gotten so used to him, and once he was gone and those throws were missing and the offense struggled to move the ball, I could tell just how good he was.

For Gabbert, I feel he gets way too little love from the fan base. His sophomore year he was more prolific statistically but I felt he got bailed out by Danario Alexander a lot, he would typically lock into Alexander and Danario would go make the play. Of course he was injured a lot of that year and I appreciate how hard he played. Then in 2010 I was very impressed by him. He did a great job spreading the ball to many receiver, and even though he relied on Egnew and TJ Moe a lot that year, he didn't lock into them like he did the prior year with Alexander -- he was happy to pivot to guys like Jerrell Jackson and Wes Kemp. And he shined in the Oklahoma game, and was overall a major reason that team got 10 wins (with a great defense too, of course). I wish I could change two things that year: the night at Texas Tech where he struggled mightily against one of the worst pass defenses in the country, and the Insight Bowl where he carried the team into position to win but then blew it with a terrible pick six towards the end. I feel like those down moments/games really color a lot of the memory of him.

And for Mauk, I will say this... he did a very admiral job filling in for Franklin in 2013 when he got hurt and was a crucial reason we won the SEC East. It's a shame that he wasn't able to set up and be the leader the team needed once he became the guy. I know a lot of people like to cite his win-loss record but let's face it, especially in 2014 that was driven by the defense and the players around him, not him. It sounds like he's got his life turned around now ([https://www.stltoday.com/sports/college/mizzou/former-mizzou-quarterback-maty-mauk-reboots-his-life-finds-peace-in-springfield/article\_1c6d3035-557a-5c7e-9c76-8cb9c8190c7e.html](https://www.stltoday.com/sports/college/mizzou/former-mizzou-quarterback-maty-mauk-reboots-his-life-finds-peace-in-springfield/article_1c6d3035-557a-5c7e-9c76-8cb9c8190c7e.html)) and I have no ill will for him, but certainly represents a lot of missed potential.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1603199106.0,,False,0.0,{},g9fg966,False,t3_jdulih,False,,True,t3_jdulih,/r/MizzouFootball/comments/jdulih/who_is_your_favorite_qb_of_the_last_20_years/g9fg966/,1615090525.0,2.0,,True,False,MizzouFootball,t5_2f37d1,r/MizzouFootball,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,,theultimatezoinks,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fx5lrcx,False,False,"Alright, here's the deal.

Bowser’s armada has been taking over worlds across the Nintendo universe. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him the Smash League, led by Mario(Superman), Link(Batman), and Samus (Wonder Woman) call in every hero they can, as well as Ganondorf (Lex Luthor), who claims that he’s changed his ways. The team sets off on their mission, but is shocked to find that Bowser’s new minions are significantly more difficult to defeat. To the shock of everyone, heroes die, it’s a slaughter as heroes are turned into mere trophies for Bowser. Bowser has won. He’s successfully taken over not only the Mushroom Kingdom, but the universe.

Two years later, Ganondorf has become the emissary to Lord Bowser himself. Link has been brainwashed to blindly follow Bowser as Dark Link. Bowser has discovered an item called the “Smash Ball” at the center of the Earth. If he gets it, he will be unstoppable. Two drilling devices have been stationed in key locations to acquire the Smash Ball. Samus now leads a squad of brainwashed heroes powerful enough to be of use to Bowser. And everyone blames Mario for failing. He was tortured by Bowser. He can no longer use any powerups. He’s just one hit away from game over. Keeping him company is Marth (Raven) a young hero who is unsure of his place in Bowser’s world. The two seek out Simon Belmont (Constantine) in the hopes that he can help him. They find him drunk with his new buddy Pac-Man (Etrigan). Despite Belmont’s reluctance, the team wants to find the last remnant of Link’s legacy: Princess Zelda (Damian). She has since become an assassin named Shiek, leading the survivors of Hyrule. Shiek reveals that she was able to keep Link’s former ally Marth (Nightwing) alive, but he hasn’t been doing well. He’s dying.

Meanwhile, Princess Peach (Lois Lane) leads a small resistance group consisting of former villains King K. Rool, Mewtwo, Wolf, Ridley, and King Dedede (The Suicide Squad) as part of Mario’s plan to take back the universe. Other surviving heroes are successful in destroying a drill, so now it’s down to Peach and Mario’s teams to save the day.

Ganondorf betrays Bowser, buying Peach more time. Mario’s team encounters Dark Link, as well as Samus’ team of heroes. However, Samus remembers who she is, and is able to turn her team against Bowser. Inside Bowser’s keep, Simon Belmont finds Sonic the Hedgehog (The Flash) running on a treadmill, powering the keep. Simon helps Sonic to his feet, and they try to run but are confronted by Mega Man, who is in charge of Bowser’s technology. Mega Man is turned to the light as well, but things aren’t going so well for Mario. Shiek tries to reason with Link, but Link kills her. With her dying words, Shiek tells Link “You are still the Hero of Time.” which finally sets Link free. In a fit of vengeance, Link duels Bowser head-on with the rest of the team.

Things take a turn for the worse when Bowser’s minions finally overrun Peach’s team. They are killed offscreen as Peach says her final farewell to Mario.

Having to watch this from Bowser’s lair, Mario begins to glow gold, and becomes invincible, taking on Bowser just like old times. But it's not enough. Pac-Man, watching the battle, decides to take action, growing to a huge size, and taking out Bowser once and for all. As the heroes defeat Bowser for the last time, Mega Man orders the planet to self destruct, with Pac-Man still on the surface.

Having finally been freed from Bowser’s rule, the remaining heroes return only to find that the other drill is still operating, and the Smash Ball is still going to explode. But Simon Belmont tells Sonic what he needs to do. Sonic needs to run so fast that he rewrites time itself. Sonic isn’t sure if he can do it, but Simon gives Sonic one of Pac-Man’s last cherries and tells him to go save the world. Mario, Link, Samus, and the last of the Smash League watch as Sonic heads off to give the world a new Genesis.",True,False,,,,,0.0,1602369522.0,,1602380703,0.0,{},g8dv2m7,False,t3_j8skgg,False,,True,t3_j8skgg,/r/fixingmovies/comments/j8skgg/how_would_you_rewrite_the_plot_of_justice_league/g8dv2m7/,1614441073.0,8.0,,True,False,fixingmovies,t5_3bqjz,r/fixingmovies,public,,0.0,[],,,,[],False,False,,damian keyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's really fresh in mind, and another Redditor sent me a bunch of resources to use as inspiration and give my take, so I'll share those here:

Brene Brown's books all deal with this theme, in various ways, too.

Being emotionally open, or emotionally vulnerable, is about sharing your internal emotional world with others. Where I see a lot of people run into trouble, in broad strokes, are these three things:  


1. Assuming it's only vulnerable to share negative emotions - sharing about your joys, about what's meaningful to you is also a part of emotional openness
2. Not doing the work of processing emotions before sharing them. Emotional processing is where you work through what you are feeling and come to a place of feeling grounded. You can learn a lot about how to do this with a therapist.
3. Not practicing good boundaries for yourself and not respecting the boundaries of others

Number 2 above is what a lot of women mean about people dumping on them - arriving with dysregulated emotions, which can be really exhausting, especially if it happens all the time and doubly so if she's in a position where she is her partners only emotional outlet, and even more so if the only shared emotions are always negative. These have an additive effect.

When it comes to receiving emotional shares from other people, there's two main things you do. The first is to check with yourself and make sure you have the spoons for it first (this is part of good boundaries). The second is - you just listen.

[],,,SmartBrown-SemiTerry,1505273459.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2jmavw,False,False,"That's fair. I'm not trying to say that he was bad. I'm trying to emphasize how his success was dependent upon his environment and the circumstances and context of the team. Isaiah was our spearhead on offense, but we also did many things to make that the case. We catered our personnel towards him, we ran plays, schemes, and sets for him. We had a bunch of wing defenders in Smart, Crowder, and Bradley all working to help cover for his defensive limitations.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
In the regular season, and even in some of the playoff series, you could find success that way. But it got exceedingly harder as you went on. And while it was a fun flash in the pan for a year or two, you knew that teams would key in on it sooner or later. And in the playoffs, they generally did. Especially Lebron's teams. So it wasn't a long term winning strategy, and as you saw, no other team including Denver ever bothered to integrate him in that way because it would mean migrating away from other winning strategies catered around their dominant personnel.  
  
I hope that makes sense. Plus, once Isaiah lost a step from the hip injury, he really was going to lose out on the only asset he had, which was his agility. He was never going to shoot over people and he needed a center like Horford to help facilitate. Without those things the ceiling was more effectively limited for any team that ran him as a key part of their scheme.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
I like to believe that Isaiah proved how any player, given the work ethic, belief, personnel, and most importantly, opportunity, can find a way to contribute and excel. But winning a championship is several magnitudes more demanding and restrictive, and by virtue of that, I think the Celtics leaned on what they knew to be the winning components of that formula. Namely, you need transcendent talent, generational type players surrounded by the right role players.

&gt; 	Opposition parties join Tory rebels to fight virus measures
&gt; Broad support for plan to defeat Johnson in next week’s vote on emergency powers

&gt; Sebastian Payne and Jim Pickard in London YESTERDAY

&gt; 
&gt; UK opposition parties are uniting around a plan to defeat Boris Johnson in a crucial vote next week by joining forces with a large group of Conservative backbenchers to give parliament a bigger say over any further coronavirus restrictions.
&gt; 
&gt; At least 60 Tory rebels are expected to be joined by Labour, the Scottish National party and other smaller parties to defeat the government and back an amendment tagged on to a vote to renew emergency powers given to the prime minister when the pandemic hit in March.
&gt; 
&gt; The level of support among Tory MPs for the amendment, which was proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative and chair of the influential 1922 committee of MPs, would overturn Mr Johnson’s 80-seat majority for the first time since December’s election.
&gt; 
&gt; The decision by Mr Johnson this week to impose sweeping nationwide restrictions in England, aimed at controlling rising infection levels, has triggered the latest backlash among Conservative backbenchers.
&gt; 
&gt; A number of party grandees said there was now a “clear” majority opposed to the government’s approach to the pandemic, which they believe will inflict further damage on the battered economy.
&gt; 
&gt; The move, which included shutting pubs and restaurants at 10pm, has widened the distrust between Downing Street and the Conservative party at Westminster, which has been building over the summer as ministers stumbled their way through the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The amendment was proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative and chair of the influential 1922 committee of MPs © Peter MacDiarmid/Shutterstock

&gt; Downing Street has so far resisted supporting the amendment although it has signalled it wants to “work closely” with MPs. “We have been clear that it is vital that we can take action to stop the transmission of the virus and protect the NHS,” a Number 10 spokesperson said
&gt; 
&gt; All opposition parties said they were still finalising their position ahead of the vote. But one well-placed party insider said Labour was “minded” to support Sir Graham’s amendment, while a Lib Dem official said the party was “sympathetic”.
&gt; 
&gt; The amendment has already been signed by three Labour MPs: former deputy leader Harriet Harman, John Spellar and John Cryer, who is chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Another said “there is a really mutinous feeling in the air, a sense that he [Mr Johnson] has lost control of his own party.”
&gt; 
&gt; Concerns among the party’s MPs that Mr Johnson has taken the wrong approach were underlined by their positive response to chancellor Rishi Sunak’s winter economic plan on Thursday. They particularly welcomed the chancellor’s message that “we must learn to live with it, and live without fear”.
&gt; 
&gt; A number of backbenchers have warned Number 10 against further nationwide coronavirus measures — such as restricting households in England from meeting up. “Not allowing families to meet is a deeply un-Conservative thing, even to say it aloud seems a mad proposal,” one said.
&gt; 
&gt; Criticism of Downing Street tends to focus on the officials around the prime minister instead of Mr Johnson personally — especially chief adviser Dominic Cummings who is seen by MPs as the “co-driver” of the government. “The problem is with the medieval court, not the king,” one well-placed Tory said.
&gt; 
&gt; Some Conservatives have discussed a plan to oust Mr Cummings — in the similar way they forced Theresa May to sack her two key aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill after the embarrassing result of the 2017 election. But the plotters have concluded any attempt would fail because Mr Johnson’s standing in the party was still strong.
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; One senior Tory said there were “layers of insulation” from different parts of the parliamentary party to protect the prime minister. “There’s the Brexiters and then the 2019 intake. For all the unhappiness, I can’t see anything fundamentally changing.”
&gt; 
&gt; Yet there are still concerns that the prime minister is struggling with the challenges posed by the pandemic. One government official who has seen him up close said: “Boris is stuck in the wrong gear, he’s constantly struggling to be on top of events. He doesn’t do well when he is constantly on the back foot and he hasn’t felt in control of events since the pandemic began.”

&gt;UK opposition parties are uniting around a plan to defeat Boris Johnson in a crucial vote next week by joining forces with a large group of Conservative backbenchers to give parliament a bigger say over any further coronavirus restrictions.

&gt;At least 60 Tory rebels are expected to be joined by Labour, the Scottish National party and other smaller parties to defeat the government and back an amendment tagged on to a vote to renew emergency powers given to the prime minister when the pandemic hit in March.

&gt;The level of support among Tory MPs for the amendment, which was proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative and chair of the influential 1922 committee of MPs, would overturn Mr Johnson’s 80-seat majority for the first time since December’s election.

&gt;The decision by Mr Johnson this week to impose sweeping nationwide restrictions in England, aimed at controlling rising infection levels, has triggered the latest backlash among Conservative backbenchers.

&gt;A number of party grandees said there was now a “clear” majority opposed to the government’s approach to the pandemic, which they believe will inflict further damage on the battered economy.

&gt;The move, which included shutting pubs and restaurants at 10pm, has widened the distrust between Downing Street and the Conservative party at Westminster, which has been building over the summer as ministers stumbled their way through the pandemic.

&gt;Downing Street has so far resisted supporting the amendment although it has signalled it wants to “work closely” with MPs. “We have been clear that it is vital that we can take action to stop the transmission of the virus and protect the NHS,” a Number 10 spokesperson said

&gt;All opposition parties said they were still finalising their position ahead of the vote. But one well-placed party insider said Labour was “minded” to support Sir Graham’s amendment, while a Lib Dem official said the party was “sympathetic”.

&gt;Another parliamentary official said “the SNP and Plaid are also inclined to support it”. MPs from the Democratic Unionist party are also expected to back it.

&gt;If Sir Graham’s amendment is passed, parliament would have to be consulted on any future use of the emergency powers to control the pandemic. But Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle will first have to select the amendment for a vote on Wednesday.

[],,,Fra_Bernardo,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4enm9dft,False,False,"Lorries will require a government permit to enter Kent as part of plans to prevent chaos at cross-Channel sea ports at the end of the year.

Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, warned that lorry drivers who did not have the correct paperwork to pass French customs faced being stopped by police using automatic number-plate recognition technology.

They would then be turned around and the drivers issued with £300 fines as part of efforts to prevent long tailbacks on roads and chaos at ports.

Updating MPs on the government’s Brexit preparations, Mr Gove said that in a “reasonable worst-case scenario” only 50 per cent to 70 per cent of large businesses and 20 per cent to 40 per cent of small and medium-size enterprises would be ready for the strict application of new EU requirements.

“In those circumstances that could mean between only 30 per cent and 60 per cent of laden HGVs would arrive at the border with the necessary formalities completed for the goods on board,” he said. “They’d therefore be turned back by the French border authorities, clogging the Dover to Calais crossing.”

Mr Gove said this could lead to queues of “up to 7,000 HGVs in Kent”. To prevent a huge backup of lorries the government plans to require all trucks crossing the Channel to have a “Kent access permit”.

The online permit would be issued to drivers who confirmed that they had all the correct paperwork using an online Smart Freight app. Anyone who had not made the declaration could be stopped by police and highways staff and turned back and the individual driver could be fined.

Ministers are concerned that if the UK strikes a Brexit deal with the European Union this could lull businesses into a false sense of security and mean that fewer prepare for new customs rules that will come into force at the end of the year.

Mr Gove said government surveys suggested that only a quarter of all businesses that export to the continent were fully prepared for the new rules regardless of whether a deal is struck.

About half think that Britain and the EU will agree to an extension of the transition period despite it now being too late for that.

Mr Gove said a Cabinet committee charged with making preparations for the end of the Brexit transition was meeting “almost daily” and had met a total of 136 times.

He added: “We also need businesses to prepare. The consequences of a lack of business preparedness will be not just economic opportunities missed for those companies that don’t prepare, but potentially much wider disruption.”

Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said people must assumed that these worst-case scenarios over the post-Brexit situation “will play out quite soon”.

She said: “The news today that there could soon be tailbacks of 7,000 lorries is quite extraordinary. I know the government has said that they are committed to building new infrastructure, but I didn’t realise it meant concreting over the Garden of England.

“Today’s warnings are based on a reasonable worst-case scenario, but given we have a reasonable worst-case government, we have to assume that these scenarios will play out quite soon.”

Damian Green, Tory MP for Ashford, asked for a guarantee that the Smart Freight system will be fully up and running from January. “The prospect of 7,000 trucks queuing to cross the Channel will send a chill through my constituents because we know what effect that has on all the roads in Kent and it’s disastrous,” he said.

Mr Gove said that the system had been developed and was “being shared with business”. He added it would allow police to enforce the new Kent access rules with ANPR technology.

Elizabeth de Jong, policy director at Logistics UK, said it would be a “huge challenge” for the government and the haulage sector to be ready for the end of the year.

Ms de Jong said: “Logistics UK has long warned government of the potential for border delays after the UK leaves the EU, and while there is still time to put mitigations in place to avoid them, it will be a huge challenge for government and industry to achieve.

“The ability of traders to complete and provide the correct paperwork will be key to ensuring the continued smooth passage of goods through the UK’s supply chain, and we are urging businesses exporting to the EU to install and understand the systems they will need to use in time for the January 1, 2021, deadline.
