Here are some things i'd recommend doing to help start a band:

- Post on Craigslist looking for musicians
- Put flyers up in music stores looking for musicians
- Put flyers up in any music school campus, usually they will have a board up in some of the halls
- Go to open mic nights, try to participate and talk to people and look for players that fit your age group and style. 
- Take group lessons and try to find players that way
- Create a BandMix account and look for people that way

Here are things to organize the band: 

- Once you have the band together, don't delay on choosing a name and developing your online presence.  Seriously, just prepare to spend a full night on it but don't put it off.  Do all the following
- Craigslist again (teaser ads for the band in all the cities close to you)
- BandCamp
- BandMix
- ReverbNation
- YouTube
- Facebook
- Soundcloud

Link all of those back to the same GMail account for the band.  Also create a Google drive for the band.  Share the details among all members, and make sure everyone has everyone's email as well as the band email/drive.  

Now here are things for organizing the music itself:

- Create a practice list / setlist as soon as possible once you all have decided on a few songs, and stick to it.  Don't add too many, just maybe 3-4 to start.  Make sure at least one is a cover, so you all have one solid thing to practice (originals often aren't perfectly fleshed out).
 - You can even include tuning and vocal warmups as a part of this.  YouTube playlist is a good idea.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizing music and putting together a band is often the hardest part of doing music.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm having a crisis of faith of sorts in my qualities as a musician, (or lack thereof). Recently I was lulled into the music promotion web, (Reverbnation especially, feverishly sunk 50$ into it). And after complete lack of engagement and a very poor crowd review (2.0 score, just abysmal), I'm rethinking my passion for music production. 

  
I understand that I'm not this amazing, flawless musician, and I'm sure I'm not mixing vocals properly, but the times another musician has spoken to me or been in contact with me and dropped and ignored me is humongous. I play out in public a lot and am beginning to think when folks come up and tell me they like my music, there not being and honest with me.

  
I don't hope to make it in the industry of course, that's not what this is about. I've been trying to join bands for more than 2 years, all silent rejections. I have no friend group so I've just released stuff online with much help.   
Many of the reviews on the Reverbnation crowd review criticized my vocals, and while yes they are rough around the edges, I don't understand why they were so extremely harsh. Whiny, cant hit any notes, painful sound and nasally.

  
Honestly, I don't know what to think of myself. I'm unsure if I have any talent or even skill in musicianship.   
I'm going attach the song that got reviewed below. I'm not looking for compliments or praise, I'm just double checking the criticism in effort to afford my mind some relief. Be honest and just tell the truth, I feel people really don't.

The band is actually called The Amend, not TheAmed.  According to the drummer's mom [(Here's her Youtube channel)](https://www.youtube.com/@KimmieSharonKMSROX/featured) they were a progressive rock band from Knoxville, Tennessee. They disbanded in late 2007 to pursue other interests. According to the Melodic Net, they started the band in early 2006. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The band consisted of:**

Matthew Sharon - Drums 

Seth Rowlette - Guitar

Brian Thomas - Vocals

Bryan Abercrombie - Bass

Ian Wallace - Guitar

&amp;#x200B;

**I found their** [**last.fm**](https://last.fm)**, ReverbNation, Melodic Net and RateYourMusic page.**

Here's the link of that:

According to their youtube channel, as well as their ReverbNation page, they had a Myspace account and an Itunes page. I can't find the Itunes page (for obvious reasons), but I did find their Myspace account. 

Sadly their account doesn't exist anymore, but it's saved on the Wayback Machine. But it doesn't work (At least not for me).

Unfortunately, I've only ever been able to find the three that were left on ReverbNation. Hopefully the release of the upcoming documentary will bring more to light.

Yesterday, the search pulled up an [article](http://www.secretmeeting.co.uk/album-rachel-baiman-common-nation-of-sorrow-review) reviewing Rachel Baiman's latest album. It mentioned that the song Old Flame was actually written about Luke, and her experience of hearing one of his songs in a bar shortly after he'd passed away.

Not much to say on it- just interesting and a bit sad to hear. If anyone hasn't, go check out her music. And Luke's.

Other than that, it seems like notable concerts are still hard to come by out here.

Unfortunately, I had to miss seeing Josh Turner back in October, and a heavy police presence outside of Michael Martin Murphy's concert earlier this month made me ultimately skip the show. Parking was ungodly, I was already 30 minutes late and hadn't found a spot after circling the block several times. They were pulling people over left and right, and I had about .3 grams in a grinder I was planning on using before the show, that I didn't feel like getting arrested over. So, that one was on me, but still. I regret missing it, because I might not get the chance to see him again.

The next and only show scheduled at that venue is Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, but it's not until the very end of March.

Other than that, I'll be seeing the Panhandlers on, I believe, January 14th at the Wagner Noel.

Currently revamping the open mic thing I've been doing. It doesn't seem possible to make it successful how I'm operating it now, and there's no clear path to securing a better venue or lineup. I'll still be running it until the summer, assuming it doesn't pick up, but after that it seems I'll just have to reach out to out of town performers that have potential and offer financial assistance on equipment/touring. I want to help the scene *some*how, but I ultimately have no clue what I'm doing and can't gain any traction.

Happy New Year!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent the last few months trying to track down the remaining Luke Bell tracks from back when he was with Fast Luke &amp;amp; the Lead Heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;ve only ever been able to find the three that were left on ReverbNation. Hopefully the release of the upcoming documentary will bring more to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the search pulled up an &lt;a href=""http://www.secretmeeting.co.uk/album-rachel-baiman-common-nation-of-sorrow-review""&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; reviewing Rachel Baiman&amp;#39;s latest album. It mentioned that the song Old Flame was actually written about Luke, and her experience of hearing one of his songs in a bar shortly after he&amp;#39;d passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much to say on it- just interesting and a bit sad to hear. If anyone hasn&amp;#39;t, go check out her music. And Luke&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it seems like notable concerts are still hard to come by out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I had to miss seeing Josh Turner back in October, and a heavy police presence outside of Michael Martin Murphy&amp;#39;s concert earlier this month made me ultimately skip the show. Parking was ungodly, I was already 30 minutes late and hadn&amp;#39;t found a spot after circling the block several times. They were pulling people over left and right, and I had about .3 grams in a grinder I was planning on using before the show, that I didn&amp;#39;t feel like getting arrested over. So, that one was on me, but still. I regret missing it, because I might not get the chance to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next and only show scheduled at that venue is Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, but it&amp;#39;s not until the very end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I&amp;#39;ll be seeing the Panhandlers on, I believe, January 14th at the Wagner Noel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently revamping the open mic thing I&amp;#39;ve been doing. It doesn&amp;#39;t seem possible to make it successful how I&amp;#39;m operating it now, and there&amp;#39;s no clear path to securing a better venue or lineup. I&amp;#39;ll still be running it until the summer, assuming it doesn&amp;#39;t pick up, but after that it seems I&amp;#39;ll just have to reach out to out of town performers that have potential and offer financial assistance on equipment/touring. I want to help the scene &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt;how, but I ultimately have no clue what I&amp;#39;m doing and can&amp;#39;t gain any traction. Made worse by me shooting myself in the foot, being a shithead and not responding to the folks that actively reach out to me on here.&lt;/p&gt;

One thing that helped me a lot was learning Chet Baker's ""My Funny Valentine"". That might not be in your range but the important aspect is how long he can hold notes and stay on pitch. I'd record myself singing with him, then play back with his version and without it, which exposed things I was weak on. Mostly it was a matter of staying relaxed and using my abs to keep air flowing steadily.

Singing at the bottom of your range is hard. Maybe you already know all this but just in case - it's important to keep your voice as relaxed as possible because the cords have to vibrate slowly. Most people tend to drop their head to their chest but that creates tension plus it takes away length from the vocal tract and squeezes the space; it's like a pipe organ, the lowest notes have the longest and widest pipes. Making all that work requires a lot of air, too.

Sometimes instead of transposing, I change the melody on the lowest notes to suit me...

Thanks for the song info. I just finished a book on the history of Brazilian popular music, Chico Buarque was one of the artists who had a section. ""Gente Humilde"" sounds like something I might like to learn.

My favorite Bossa Nova song is without a doubt ""√Åguas de Mar√ßo"", the Elis Regina and Tom Jobim version. The English ""Waters of March"" doesn't quite get the feeling of the original for me, so I wrote my own English version that tries to get more of its spirit.

I still fit in my biker jacket I bought in 1977, it survived a lot. 

I love the song I heard! It took me back to real OG punk stuff from back in the day, thank you for the link! I just gave it 1 listen but saved it, you have more, yes? My brother was a drummer in a band called Genocide, my ex was the singer (it was all shock value, they didn't support any shit, you're old enough to get the OG punks wore stuff that was offensive for that reason only-just saying for any eyes in r/punk who take it seriously) anyway here's a link to a song that uses the same c-word, you may like it, they sold albums in Europe, just re-released an album... they toured and all that... they have a bunch of songs on YouTube.

You can't compare your scene to cbgbs, every scene all over is cool and valid as long as you've got live bands and a scene. I was just lucky to live close enough to go all the time. My band played at cbgbs, we also played a lot at corner bars that developed a scene, where half the audience were in other bands. It's all good as long as it's fun.

But I honestly feel that if artists are only looking at distributors and labels as what works for them, then I do think the artist gets the short end of the stick.  So to say there's a solution, there's no one solution because it's up to you as the artist.  So what if I said DistroKid was the best, but you didn't like that one, so where's the solution?  There's not!  I have artists in rotation that are with DistroKid, some with CD Baby, some with ReverbNation, some who pay for radio play, while others don't do any of it because they sell their stuff locally and that's where they shine.  Not every option out there is a solution, and not every solution is a one size fits all type of thing.  It's really up to you and other artists where you go and where you don't go, but I don't feel that artists should classify everyone as one thing because of one wrong seed.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, and for some they don't work at all but artists don't realize that 99% of the time because they feel the distributor should do everything and them doing nothing.

I had just stepped up on a national level when my issues became a real problem. I opened for John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown band in Newport, R.I. back in 2014. I also donate 100% of my song ""Shelter Dog"" to support rescue animals. I've raised over a thousand dollars with it, and that's something I'm pretty proud of. Not an easy song to listen to, but it comes from the heart. After being in animal rescue, there's things I can never unsee and it affected me profoundly. üòû 

As for my situation, I'm not the only one by a long shot. There's hundreds of thousands of ppl suffering around the world. Rather than just lay down and die, I made my mess my message and created an awareness website. For 7 years, I advocated and worked with professionals as well as advocates to bring awareness. However, in 2021, I had to stop as I couldn't do it anymore. 
If you want to understand just how bad the situation is, watch the documentary The Bleeding Edge. Pay close attention to Dr Steve Towers segment, that's part of what I'm dealing with.
You can also watch my ""watered down"" version on YouTube by punching in this title ""Innovation, Metal Toxicity - Journey's of Implant Illness"". It demonstrates the vastness of the issue and some, of the different devices.

My only issue I still struggle with is the apathy of the public and gaslighting of the medical system. You'll better understand that statement if you watch the documentary. 
What happened to me was completely preventable yet no one would help. Remortgaging our home ($74,000 out of pocket) for a procedure that promised to improve my health and instead is, stealing it away with no justice? Yeah, some days are better than others. 

I'm so very sorry to hear of your brain issue however, I can totally relate as I deal with a form myself. A neuropsych exam showed a massive deficit, but I think you'll agree, you don't need no test to know you're slipping. A lot of times just trying to have a conversation can be a challenge. I have to play ""charades"" a lot of the time because I can't find the words. You must be dealing with the same kind of setbacks?
Bitter pill to swallow considering I was once an electrician in my real job and now can't even wire a freaking light bulb. üòí 

Agree with your positivity as we learn too late, life is very short and should be lived, not loathed. 

Thank you for the kindness, I can tell you're a good soul. I'm seldom on any platforms now, my fatigue and pain make it hard to get things done. Just getting my dishes done is a major accomplishment now. 

Any hoot, a few of my tunes are on YouTube and the rest are on a music site called Reverbnation. On there, I have a wide variety of genres from Whitney Houstons ""I Believe In You And Me"" to, Patsy Clines, ""Walking After Midnight"", to Bonnie Raitts ""Love Me Like A Man"". You'll find my music by googling Deann Merchant.

I had just stepped up on a national level when my issues became a real problem. I opened for John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown band in Newport, R.I. back in 2014. I also donate 100% of my song &amp;quot;Shelter Dog&amp;quot; to support rescue animals. I&amp;#39;ve raised over a thousand dollars with it, and that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;m pretty proud of. Not an easy song to listen to, but it comes from the heart. After being in animal rescue, there&amp;#39;s things I can never unsee and it affected me profoundly. üòû &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my situation, I&amp;#39;m not the only one by a long shot. There&amp;#39;s hundreds of thousands of ppl suffering around the world. Rather than just lay down and die, I made my mess my message and created an awareness website. For 7 years, I advocated and worked with professionals as well as advocates to bring awareness. However, in 2021, I had to stop as I couldn&amp;#39;t do it anymore. 
If you want to understand just how bad the situation is, watch the documentary The Bleeding Edge. Pay close attention to Dr Steve Towers segment, that&amp;#39;s part of what I&amp;#39;m dealing with.

Testimonials: If you are using a product or service, then you can give a testimonial of it and normally they will include a link back to your website. A good example of this is your hosting company; you can contact them to see if they need testimonials and I am sure they are happy to leave a link back to your website that is hosted by them.

Blogger Reviews: If you offer a product or service, you can give bloggers a sample for free and they will write a review about your product or service giving you a backlink.

Donation to Webmasters: The idea of this is to donate to dead communities or websites with high page rank and often you will get a backlink in return.

Even one person who hears your music is 1. a potential fan/follower, 2. At least another stream. And unless you're Dua Lipa, streams do NOT come that easy.

Now when you say publishing, is your song officially released through a distributor? Or do mean publishing as promotion which is what I think you meant.

Assuming you have an official release through a distributor, there is a long list of things you must to do promote it.

1. FB, IG, TW, TT, 
2. Soundcloud
3. Bandcamp
4. Reverbnation
5. Relevant groups on FB (dozens)
6. Relevant subs on Reddit (though I find those a waste of time) (over a dozen)
7. Relevant groups on Quora (over a dozen)

You should be prepromoting 2 -3 weeks before your release date on your SM.

Do you have an email list? You should start building one now for your future releases. Sign up to Mailchimp free for 1000 contacts limit. Create and send out a sign up form like mine: [http://helosbonos.xyz/email\_signup](http://helosbonos.xyz/email_signup) whenever and wherever you can (see what I did there?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin))

Google music blogs. Create a spreadsheet with every site, email, submit link, and contact you find. Then email them according to their guidelines.

Now you need to find a good playlist service but you have to be careful that they do not use bots to run traffic to their list.

This is just the beginning. Prepare to keep busy researching and promoting for at least a month or two. Once you have some of these lists and spreadsheets together, it will be easier in the future.

Facebook ads will probably be great for you as well but there's a steep learning curve and it costs money which you should be spending on your promo anyways.

There are only ever two reasons why people say things like ""things were cooler/better back in [year/decade]."" 

1. Is that those where their formative years, when they were the most ""plugged in"" and invested in the trends of the day therefore the trends of the era imprinted on them the most or...

2. They weren't alive (or were very young) during that decade and now looking at a filtered ""highlight reel"" of the best aspects of it, now refined and curated from years or decades of people spoonfeeding the best aspects of it to eachother.

When I was younger, I was extemely nostalgic about the 60s/70s. Muscle cars, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, etc. I was obsessed with this notion that there was *something* about those decades that was special.

My dad is also super nostalgic about that era because he grew up in it (guess who was curating my perception of that time). But upon talking to my Grandma, who grew up in the 50s, she really can't pinpoint anything ""special"" about the late 60s or 70s aside from major news events, she was busy raising kids.

People have said this about every decade. When I was in high school, people were just becoming nostalgic about the 90s. That was 10 years ago, so we seem to be right on time for the 2000s.

My suggestion is to actively look for the gems in the current era, a lesson I learned after being labeled a ""[wrong generation kid](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/le-wrong-generation)"" in middle school and devoting myself to findinf cool, new shit in High School.

I recently started gigging throughout San Diego County as of March 2022. Before that I used to work at a brewery in San Diego and helped with hiring musicians. I can give you some advice that has helped me book gigs and could possibly help you! 

You don't need to make a BandCamp or ReverbNation or an account for any of those sites. I've found that they are not useful for landing gigs at local spots close to you. Also I've noticed a lot of sites that provide networking you to play at venues take a portion of your profits, which can be avoided. You can skip all that really. 

The key is to market yourself to these potential venues, bars, breweries, wineries, restaurants, coffee shops, or anywhere that has live music really.

I suggest you create a website along with professional photos of yourself and a bio that showcases your experience and the 'product' you are selling. I also suggest you create YouTube videos that give people an idea of your style and who you are as an artist. Post your favorite covers and originals. I think having a website stands out and it shows that you are *serious.* If anything landing gigs is about selling yourself and what you offer an establishment! 

Create a Facebook page of your music and also have a Instagram with polished photos and videos of your artistry. A lot of local breweries, wineries, and restaurants like to see that you have a fan base and that you can bring people to their establishment. Which can help you negotiate your price!  

My last tip to you is email, call, and go to establishments in person! Also have business cards with you so that you can give it to any one interested in booking you. If you have business cards always with you and you network with people that enjoy your music, there is potential for being booked for *private events,* which pays better. 

P.S the money you make gigging can help pay for EP/LP, new gear, Facebook/Instagram marketing, and etc. Good luck! :-)",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_zx1x5h,,,False,/r/noisemusic/comments/zx1x5h/what_do_i_need_to_book_a_gig_advice_for_a_beginner/j3ns8xf/,public,False,t1_j3ns8xf,,,[],1673298639.0,r/noisemusic,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1673288834.0,1676177081.0,,,,

Music booking agencies: Many booking agencies represent a wide range of artists and can help you find acts that are a good fit for your venue.  
  
Artist management companies: Similar to booking agencies, artist management companies often represent artists who are looking for gigs and may be willing to play at your venue.  
  
Music industry websites: Websites like Bandcamp, Sonicbids, and ReverbNation allow artists to create profiles and promote their music to potential booking agents and venues.  
  
Social media: Many artists use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to promote their music and find gigs. You can use these platforms to search for artists in your area or specific genres that you're interested in booking.  
  
Local music scenes: Another option is to get involved in your local music scene and network with artists and industry professionals in your area. This can be a great way to discover new talent and potentially book acts for your venue.

My car is my primary CD listening zone, and i collect cds myself(at thrift) so its good for listening to what i want. The importance here is...having cds and vinyl, i listen to specific stuff i know i like. But the multiple radios all over with different purposes keep things ultra diverse  


Then of course, there is looking at eras. like 80s funk. find a band you like, use your yt premium to go down that bands album rabbit hole. etc  


Also, reddit is a great place for random ass recommendations (like this sub). some stuff is horrible, some isnt.   


people will be like ""music sucks so much nowadays"". the truth is, maybe its just popular music. If you dig deep enough, you can find crazy good music no matter the year/era  


Lastly, consider smaller artists such as myself or others. Soundcloud is an excellent resource for random music..i imagine bandcamp is decent, reverbnation, etc.   


If you are ever in a musical rut, it could be you need to broaden how you go about finding it. Thrift, radio, internet.   


p.s. try real hard to NOT have preferences when searching.

Do some freelance work on sites like fiverr. Even if your dream isn't to make music for other people it let's you really hone your skills. When someone hires you to do something you don't normally do it's an interesting challenge and if you do a good job they are very appreciative. It also pays.

&gt;	The sound of Susquatch can be summed up in two words: Passion &amp; Jenglish. The band formed in 2002 when frontman Kenta Oshikiri met drummer Maki Nakano while attending school for music. Since then, support guitarists and bassplayers Hirotsugu Fujiwara and Yusuke Bava (respectively). Their sound is an indie-punk-rock with delicious flavours of jazz chords and jazz drumming throughout. They are setting out to find an intricate balance between indie rock, punk, pop and jazz. Susquatch play smooth jazzy melodic compositions furnished with aggressive drumming and intricate guitar work to add a forceful edge.

&gt;Kenta's sung neither in English nor Japanese, but in his own creative lexicon which mimics English slightly. He writes songs this way because he enjoys the sound of vocals in English but isn't fluent in the language. When he sings these particular lyrics, neither Japanese nor English people can understand what he's singing - However, the amount of passion he has shines through in his performance, making any lyrics (whether coherent or not) obselete. Drummer Maki Nakano can easily be named one of the greatest drummers in Japan, and possibly one of the best female drummers in the world. Her agility and speed are unmatched, along with her precision with articulations while maintaining her incredible ability to keep tempo. Listening to her on the albums is a pleasure but seeing her play live is truly awe inspiring. Guitarist Hirotsugu Fujiwara and Tusuke Bava joined the band as live support musicians but will likely remain with the band thanks to the success they have acquired in Japan, and the growing success in Canada and the United States. During their first Canadian tour (Oct/2010), newfound fans have called Susquatch one of the tightest and most energetic live bands they have ever seen. Their jazz-rock base along with a phenomenal rhythm section makes Susquatch stand out among most modern bands. Fans can't help but dance, groove and rock out to the music.

Unfortunately a lot of these platforms are set up to extract money from hopeful artists.

Of course it depends on what you want from your music, and what success looks like to you.

&amp;#x200B;

The top 3 artists on the global charts on ReverbNation have the following activity on Spotify:

1 - 20,119 monthly listeners. This artist has a big reach outside of Spotify though, with a bunch of other stuff going on other than music (podcasts, social work, religious outreach).

2 - 906 monthly listeners. This artist has won awards and is active in other areas of music (tv/film sync).

3 - 17 monthly listeners. Can't find much about this artist.

&amp;#x200B;

Goes without saying but streams don't equal 'success' of course, but most artists that post about promotion are ultimately looking at building a fan base and streams are important for algorithms on Spotify.

Ultimately I don't think something like ReverbNation offers much to anybody except musicians, very few listeners use that platform. It's also full of bots, which you can pay to 'fan' you on there.

I can't speak for Drooble but a quick google shows somewhat middling reviews, with lots of people citing scams and questionable practices. 

I'd say you're better off investing the money back into yourself, or saving it for when you plan to do a release, see if you can pump it into a reputable PR company or just invest in your sound in other ways (equipment, tuition, software etc).

You aren't solving a problem.

You claim that you are solving the problem that musicians ""don't own 100% of their music"". What does that mean?

There have been tons of music focused social media platforms, from PureVolume, to ReverbNation, to MusicUnited and hundreds of others. The problem is, there aren't enough musicians to sustain growth for something like this. I want non-musicians to hear my stuff too, which is why I utilize Youtube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest. Those platforms already have billions of users, so you're only trying to cannibalize those users for your platform. 

I already own 100% of my music, but if I want to make money from streams, advertisements, record sales, etc., I already know I have to split my money with the platforms. If you claim your app gives 100% of money to artists you're either lying or desperate to go out of business. 

And just saying ""blockchain"" and ""NFT"" doesn't mean anything. A blockchain is nothing more than a record of what happens on a digital system. Who gives a shit about what happens on your app? Blockchain is pointless. An NFT is nothing more than paying money for a digital file that anyone can copy. Kind of like buying a record from a store.

For a vast majority of musical artists, this is simply not true. Do you realize the caliber of musician you'd have to be for that to happen? If word spreads that Billie Eilish is now contract-less, that could potentially happen. But is the artist you're ""quasi managing"" Billie Eilish or Justin Bieber? ... I didn't think so.

Now, to answer your question about labels... please bear with me because there's a lot that goes into this. 

First of all, can we please agree to just say that ""making it big"" for most musicians means that they reach a stage where they can quit their day job, for one, and secondly, they are secure enough to not need another day job for the rest of their lives (if all goes as planned)? So when I refer to anything like that--i.e., a musician making it--I don't necessarily mean they've joined the ranks of an Ariana Grande but just that they make a comfortable living performing their own music without the looming threat of ever having to take another cruise ship gig again. Cool?

OK, now here's the thing with artists and labels in 2022. (And this is to answer the question(s) along the lines of Does an artist need a label anymore? And, Should you bother submitting to labels?)

In under a matter of 20 years I'd say, the whole streaming music thing has turned the industry almost completely upside-down. 20 years ago I used to bitch about how ""not fair"" it was that in order to have your demo heard by practically anyone, you couldn't have it be ""unsolicited"". ..  Well now, I seriously long for those days. 

Now, there are so many labels and ""pseudo labels"" out there that the lines between who is a real good label that will provide serious financial backing (and other stuff like promo, etc.) are so blurred that it's sick (not in a good way). 

Let's get this out of the way actually: Are there labels out there who will ACTUALLY listen to your demos? Yes. But now, because of the way the industry has morphed, it becomes a new question of what can the industry do for you? 

Let me give you an example of wtf I am talking about. There's a site you may have come across called LabelRadar.com. They are 100% legit. There are other similar sites who are NOT as legit (ReverbNation readily springs to mind), but LabelRadar IS legit and people DO get ""signed"" to their labels. 

Also, they have the backing of some of the giants in the edm genre. Monstercat for one.

So what's the problem then? Why would I be reluctant to tell you to sign up (free) for LabelRadar and just go balls to the wall on there?

Because, here's the problem: What labels like the ones you find on sites like LR, they don't sign the artist anymore--they sign the track. 

It used to be that ""getting signed"" meant the label would loan you a chunk of money to record your album, they'd take care of marketing and promo, and then you'd pay them back their investment after going on tour...and then the difference is yours to keep. 

They used to invest in the ARTIST (the artist, the brand, as a whole). Now, labels might agree to release just one song, say. They're not booking you for any gigs or handing over cash so you can rent a recording space. They're taking your already FINISHED track and releasing it to their ""label"". 

This could mean a number of things (seeing as I literally can create my own label in under 5 minutes with this one app): They might stream you, they might put you on the other side of their next vinyl compilation, or they might put your songs up on their YouTube site. The end result is the same usually: you get more exposure. How much more varies depending on the strength of the label, but that's about it. After that it's up to the artist to do what they can to turn that exposure into something more. 

What about submitting to labels directly though? Won't they release my whole album? 

Yes many will. I actually don't know where you've been these last couple of years (no offense) but of course legitimate, semi-big labels that accept unsolicited ""demos"" are out there! Wtf. 

Let's take for example Grimes' first label 4AD. (And if you don't know who Grimes is right off the bat and PRIOR to her entanglement with Elon Musk then that illustrates the next problem right there.) 

There are better known labels (especially here in the US) than 4AD but 4AD is decent. You submit right through their website via a form (or else through email) generally. If 4AD signs you you won't get a lot of money to redo your album or anything, but you will get exposure and they will probably book you to play festivals and your whole album will be marketed on their website, their YT channel, Instagram, whatever. 

It's a notch slightly up. 

But have you ""made it big"" yet? Can you quit your day job now?

No probably not. Because they're not offering you a world tour (or even a West Coast tour for that matter). If you don't know it already, the only way performing artists actually make their money is off of their performances. It's not off their sales. So when you get those festival gigs lined up through 4AD (and they even fly you out there all expenses paid) and you play in front of HUNDREDS of people... I imagine that feels a lot like the real deal. 

Except it's not. It's more like Pay to Play because you're playing in exchange for exposure, not the $$ you need to pay your rent. What results is that at best, you garner a small cult following. These fans are loyal to the core, they'll buy every piece of merch you put out there, but that won't be enough for you to be able to say that you've ""made it"".

There are exceptions. Take Lana Del Rey. Big effing exception. She's a lucky girl. Because that never ever happens except to maybe 0.00001% of the population. (J/k of course I have no idea of the actual percentage, just that it's so rare that I want to cry.)

So take from that what you will. I could say more but this is already long as is. Except now I have a question for you: you mentioned you stand behind this guy you quasi-manage because of production value...but what about melody, hook.. you know, the creative aspect? Is this individual talented? (They don't have to be to make it, but I'm just curious as to the nature of your entanglement with each other.)

But that is honestly--I don't want to be mean but--it's a giant myth that the labels will come to you anymore. They don't do that. They have enough demos to contend with as is and bigger labels (the only ones you want to really say YES to without much thought) don't have enough time to go our scouting their own talent. This isn't 1920s Hollywood, but it's not late 80s Seattle either. That shit just doesn't happen. I'm sorry. It's an old wives tale.

I dated a musician and he honestly thought he was entitled to me helping him with his career which I would have done but he wouldn‚Äôt tell me the exact details of his personal sex life. 

It‚Äôs not about monogamy. Throw that out the window. 

It‚Äôs about at our age the musician usually has a borderline personality chick who worships him and will stalk you relentlessly when she thinks you are the other woman and you have no clue about her. 

Few musicians make a living wage. You can tell if they work for actual cash beyond ego by checking reverbnation and gig finder. Look at the profile and how many times booked. 

Even getting a gig as a back up musician does not pay what you would expect. 

Even being formerly famous with a top 40s hit from the early 1990s going on pop cruises still paid less than $15k a year with one of my old boyfriends. 

Another bragged how talented he was but was just working for what was in the tip jar at 60 and is basically a hobo-sexual going through his rotation of women til he dies. 

If I dated a musician again it would have to be a union one with his own health insurance from a standing show.

We could subpoena records from CDBaby or BandCamp or ReverbNation to affirm that we uploaded x song at y date. There's a veritable mountain of evidence that we recorded that album.

Now, sure, there's the question of ""what if they stole a completely unrecorded song."" But how would they *do* that? Show up at a local bar in northern Nevada with a digital recorder in their pocket?

Just about every suggestion I've heard is correct. The lead guitars need adjusting, a metronome will help the drums keep time, hooks help. 

You REALLY need a producer, though, first and foremost. Someone who can hear what you are doing and correct the issue during the process. There's a guy that had been my go-to for 20 years in Northern Michigan named Alex Lee Grubaugh. Decent rates, great guy. He's worked with a lot of groups, including Famous Last Words. His current project can be found on YouTube (link below). Hit him up for production help.

The very basic ""community"" and mailing list stuff is good, inasmuch as the artists I follow who use it are using it for good things; posting about upcoming tour dates, merch restocks, vinyl pressings, upcoming releases, etc., and I'm notified by the Bandcamp app as soon as one of the artists I like/follow posts a new album/track. That's pretty much all I ever need to know about any of the artists I listen to. Best of all though, I only see stuff from the people I *want* to see it from.

I'd really hate to see BC become another place where I'm constantly inundated with ads and ""Recommended Artists"" as a listener, or where I'm expected to engage with that stuff as an artist to grow my listenership. It's nice that there's still some respite from that on Bandcamp.

Besides that, Bandcamp is a site *for music*, and as such, the vast majority of the people who would even use its social features would be other musicians, music journalists, and influencers (at best). It would quickly devolve into another SoundCloud (or worse...ReverbNation); full of spam, scams, and relentless unsolicited requests from unserious randos for ""collabs."" None of the other sites I use for buying or streaming music have these problems because they aren't social media platforms; they're storefronts.

I really and truly feel you on hating Instagram. It's absolutely terrible. I feel like I take psychological damage every time I open the app. Trying to use it to keep up with anything I actually care about is a nightmare. It's nothing but a barrage of sponsored content, ads for multi-level marketing schemes, boomer bullshit, and the most vapid useless nonsense imaginable. Using it *as an artist* is even worse, because you have to constantly generate content to remain relevant and stay in your followers' feeds.

It's slow going, at least for me. This might partly be because I have a very specific genre that isn't exactly commercial. 

One thing I've done is find groups on Facebook that allow me to share my music. But I don't just share my music, I also try to interact with people there who are also sharing their music. It seems like being a participant in the community gives you a credibility that you wouldn't otherwise get. 

I make lyric videos and put them on YouTube, and try to make them as professional as possible. This is where my biggest source of income has been. I make playlists there with my music interspersed with other popular songs in similar genres. I name the playlists around feelings or moods to try to get search results.

I think we all just want to make money while we make music. If that's you, then consider putting links to sheet music, merchandise, direct downloads, custom requests, and anything else that might suit your audience and genre.

Patreon has been a decent source of income for me, and the people there also help with spreading the word which is fantastic. It's challenging to come up with perks in exchange for their hard-earned cash.

Sign up with every sharing site you can find, try to interact with real fans, be personable, ask about their lives, love people.

Some music sharing sites:
Soundcloud
Jamendo
Bandcamp
YourListen
Logamp
ReverbNation

Regularly search for new sharing sites, and as you find them, try to participate in the community there.

Years and years ago when I worked for the state, I was doing interviews and case management for SNAP. We got this dude in, who looked absolutely awesome, long greasy hair, great eyeliner, great accent but the most important part: his legal name was Kentucky Slim Sterling. Trying to do his income was a pain because self employment is always difficult and he said he was a musician. My best friend at work and I were obsessed with this dude and I eventually looked up his music; it was this awesome satanic country punk blues stuff, but it was scattered on all this different websites like ReverbNation and Myspace which was dying at the time, so I quickly downloaded it all and burned all 12 or so songs I could find to a CD for me and him. Anyway, I just saw the obituary today and my dude Kentucky Slim Sterling died this last week.

So what I want to know here is, what's the best way I can upload this tracks to one place and make them easy to share without making it look like I own them? I really want to give this guy's music to as many people as I can

1) the problem is that these streaming platforms are NOT profitable. Platform effects make only Spotify marginally profitable, but they can‚Äôt pay a dime more to individual artists without tipping the scales. Every other platform is unprofitable. That means every link along the line to a stream will fall when VCs stop the quantitative easing fantasy. The hit factory, avatar, Columbia, Sony, you name a big studio, the reason they closed is because what they did (recordings for money) became unsustainable.

2) firstly, I don‚Äôt believe you. But let‚Äôs say I did‚Äîwhat you are in that case is lucky and well-connected. As what you do has no correlation to recording value (zero is zero no matter how talented you are), your chief skill is in creating the impression of value and sustaining dual myths of meritocracy and the general health of the music ecosystem. Which you‚Äôre doing even now in your free time on Reddit so ‚Äîgreat?

3) sync is great for the already connected, in my experience if you aren‚Äôt Drake it can‚Äôt compare to a quarter of a normal paycheck at a relatively mid-tier software company or bank. There is definitely an industry in PR and publishing where you charge artists for the impression that they MIGHT get a ‚Äúbig sync‚Äù, but when deep pockets people want Bjork, they pay Bjork, not some soundalike loser with a Reverbnation who recorded with ‚ÄúReddit‚Äôs favorite part-time know it all‚Äù

4) I‚Äôm not being an edge lord, I believe in what I believe sincerely because I think it‚Äôs really sad weird and creatively limiting to believe in this meritocratic, conservative, old-school idea of the industry. It‚Äôs over, music is not. Recordings != music, but this is a forum about engineering, which is being phased out just like so many other jobs as the economy flattens. 

I understand that you disagree, but a cursory understanding of macroeconomics applies here. If the barrier to entry gets lower, the supply grows endlessly. Demand decreases every day (especially for the live-focused, white boy nerd types with domineering personalities that tend to have the socioeconomic capital to buy gear) ‚Äî and is trending toward a limit of zero. 

When supply outstrips demand, you get most artists suffering while an ever smaller group collect the fruits of *everyone‚Äôs* labor, that‚Äôs what ‚Äúplatform effect‚Äù means and if you can‚Äôt see that‚Äôs happened to music (and every other content industry) then you‚Äôre ngmi",,,,,False,True,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_rax6cx,,,False,/r/audioengineering/comments/rax6cx/can_you_work_part_time_as_an_audio_engineer_to/hno9d5r/,public,False,t1_hno9d5r,,,[],1638932322.0,r/audioengineering,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1638641086.0,1645760396.0,,,,

I guess ReverbNation is also still out there. The free version of SoundCloud has storage limits so you will have to curate what you keep publicly available.  YouTube is a good option if you want to make lyric videos or create some visual content to go with your songs.  You Tube is also good for recording videos of yourself performing covers, which is one way folks build a following.

You'll want to leverage Social Media to promote your music ‚Äî use the platform you're most familiar with of course, TikTok and IG Reels are the current hotnesses.  Don't focus solely on promoting the music, but engage with the platforms in a way that feels naturalistic and true to yourself and your interests.  I haven't gotten into it myself, but I know a lot of folks who have been building their following through live streaming on Twitch.

SoundCloud will also be useful when you want to start using submission tools like SubmitHub and Groover, as both platforms allow you to submit using SoundCloud links.  Groover apparently offers submissions for ""mentors"" ‚Äî haven't checked that out, but that might be a good way to get feedback before you move to working with distributors.

When you get serious about releasing music, look into services like CDBaby, DistrioKid, etc. but you'll want to make sure your recording production is of a professional quality before embarking on that route.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_r9iixe,,,False,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/r9iixe/where_do_i_start/hnj87xo/,public,False,t1_hnj87xo,,,[],1638839029.0,r/WeAreTheMusicMakers,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1536534784.0,1645777346.0,,,,

I've heard many amazing songs that have less than a few thousand total streams.  Often, the craft is not to blame; it's the lack of promotion.  But such is life.

&gt;I generally don‚Äôt like reverbnation, but one thing they have that‚Äôs cool is their crowd review service. You do have to pay for it, but it really isn‚Äôt that much to get a couple dozen reviews from strangers, and if you think you have a really good track, could be worth it.

I've never used reverbnation but I've used the crowd review service on Drooble which I think is pretty similar.  I've found it to be somewhat helpful.  Flawed, but still helpful.

In some ways I wish that uploading to spotify and the other major platforms could include some kind of filter. Then on subs when someone shares their work and they have a Spotify link, you might think, oh ok they made it to Spotify so this has got to be well done. Pros and cons to that, but I sure wish there was a bit less noise out there. And then, filtering probably isn‚Äôt in the best interest of Spotify and definitely isn‚Äôt in the best interest of digital distributors. They, and many in the industry, seem to bank a lot off of hopeful artists. 

And promotion tough because if you really have something good, you almost always need at least some kind of promotion to rise above the noise and reach the people who would really connect to your music. And yeah, for that to be sensible, you definitely want some reliable objective feedback.

Hmm. 

&gt; Additionally, if commercial artists don't want other people using their beats it is quite easy to have your distributor disallow free use, in which case anyone who attempts to post a tune they recorded over such a beat will be flagged for copyright violation and their tune will be removed from youtube or soundcloud, or wherever it's been posted. I've had to rerecord quite a few tunes for artists who met this fate. 

&gt;So you can't really steal a lexus from youtube and get to drive it out of the shop (to extend your metaphor). 

&gt;Since the real money on the producer's side is selling the licensing to vocalists, not selling downloads, and major label artists can choose to have the copyright bots take down tunes by anyone who uses their intellectual property, the comparison of downloads to theft is not as clear cut as you suggest.

Okay. I see your point, but surely there's a better medium for getting beats than Youtube, no? ADN? Reverbnation maybe? Soundclick? When you extended the metaphor, were you imagining that it was being stolen from the showroom? Because everything you've mentioned that deals with the protection of intellectual property feels like it's geared towards the labels- not the artist. This is probably a problem and discussion for another thread, but still. 

TBH- I hate that whole ""you wouldn't steal a car"" metaphor - I love the free exchange of ideas - but IP is IP, and should be protected. The quality/fidelity issues aside (come on guys, aim higher than youtube!) - it's not the ideal platform now, is it? 

Anyway. Like I said starting out. A great reply to a snide comment.

Our debut album was recorded in 2015, but the band has since reformed with a new bass player (that's me) and drummer. We're writing lots of new material for an upcoming second album, and we're excited to be able to play shows again once that's a safe thing to do.

OMG you are hilarious. They've always been hugely corrupt. Go read some music history.

They did not. There was literally no way for me to discover the vast majority of talented artists in let's say Serbia. You could not buy recordings in the US. Now it's extremely easy for me to discover tens of thousands of artists in Serbia.

&gt; Johann Sebastian Bach was an independent artist.

Perhaps. He probably had patrons. But so what? How would the average person in Brazil or China have heard of him and discovered his music back then? Today someone in Brazil can easily find classical composers from all over the world.

&gt; The thing is whether the tools are appealing to most of current consumers. And ReverbNation/SoundCloud aren't.

No that's not the thing. Your claim was about centralization which is about control. Your claim was not about appeal and choice. If consumers don't *choose* to use ReverbNation, that's not because of a few people controlling things. It's simply their choice. Things are highly decentralized now compared to the 1970s and 1980s.

It is a highly competitive industry much like professional sports. Loads of wannabes, some even very talented. Very very few who can actually earn a living from it, and those very few earn a lot. It's all or nothing and always has been. But what they have now is far better than the zero income they would have earned back then. At least now they can reach a global audience and with a little luck make some profit.

&gt;  People get interested in music in the first place, or in musical styles, and so on, when they are exposed to it. So if they are not among the 0,01% of people who are actively searching for independent artists on these platforms, then not only the general public consumption and industry are not going to be affected by these apps,

Exactly like when record executives did not sign them and radio DJs did not play them. At least now they do get discovered by some folks outside of their local scene. Which is better than in the 1970s and 1980s.

&gt; In the old days, you had a system in place that allowed experimental and innovative styles to gain traction and become huge, such as Blues, Jazz, R&amp;B, Rock. Today, you do NOT have that.

Record labels still exist and still largely control what becomes massively popular. Less than in the past, but not much. So if anything your criticism is aimed at record labels who are failing at their job of promoting experimental and innovative styles. That has nothing to do with YouTube and the ""tech monopoly"" which was your original argument.

But I don't even accept your claim. I hear innovative stuff on a regular basis, and I'm pretty damn jaded. Plenty of it is promoted by record labels. Just as one example, Mumble rap originated on SoundCloud. Lil Pump was signed to Warner Records for $$$ millions and is huge now. Plenty of other examples.

&gt; In other words, it was more likely that a artist in Buenos Aires could reach a listener in Sidney than it is today. 

That's nonsense. I did not listen to small independent artists from around the world in the 1970s and 1980s. I do today. 

&gt; Because it was easier to convince a record label to publish you than it is today to be found in Spotify.

So go find them on ReverbNation instead of Spotify. Your argument relies on Spotify being the only option. It is not the only option. Bands post their stuff ALL over the place. Your problem isn't discoverability. It's either laziness or refusal to use anything other than Spotify.
 
&gt; But I think I've said enough already.

Indeed. It should be crystal clear to you by now that I'm not falling for your unsubstantiated claims, buzzwords, and inconsistent positions. Things are far more decentralized now than they were in the 1970s and 1980s. And I know this from personal experience. 

The music I listened to back then was highly limited and curated and it was literally impossible to discover small bands from around the world. Today I listen to small local groups from everywhere. Often I can't even understand the lyrics because it's a language I don't know. And they are easy for me to discover. When I get lazy, I can resort to an AI like Spotify recommendations. Or YouTube recommendations. Or Last.fm recommendations. Or hop on one of the internet radio sites I use that play local radio stations from all over the world. And if I get sick of that? Big record labels still exist too. Discoverability is far better now than at any time in all of history.

Like I said in another comment, the discussion boils down to calculating the probability P that a talented artist A in a point in the world would be listened to by a person B in another point in the world. And what I am saying is that P\_back\_then &gt; P\_today. And the breakdown goes as follows:

P\_back\_then = P\_record\_label\_publishing\_back\_then

P\_today = P\_record\_label\_publishing\_today + P\_youtube\_discoverability + P\_spotify\_discoverability \* P\_person\_B\_has\_spotify + P\_soundcloud\_discoverability \* P\_person\_B\_has\_soundcloud + P\_reverbnation\_discoverability \* P\_person\_B\_has\_reverbnation

Yes. Major record labels still exist and still sign new musicians.

I don't have to wait for a radio station to play them. I can do it all on my own with no record executive involved in making the call. That's the opposite of centralized.

No need to think. It's historical fact that they were selected by a major label. They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969 and that's who paid for their recording studio time. Philips was a major label in the world of rock and pop music starting in the 1950s.

Who is paying for that? Music studios were expensive. The equipment in them was expensive. The engineers that ran the equipment were expensive. Pressing records was expensive.

Could have but did not. I know because I was there. That did change in the 1980s with punk and the DIY approach. But that did not bring fame and success to those bands. The vast majority of local punks bands spent more money than they ever earned from their music. A very small handful like the Dead Kennedys and Black Flag did ok.

So how did folks discover music in the 1970s or 1980s? I remember listening to the radio, which had the same hundred or so songs played over and over again on rotation. Wait a month or two for new songs. You could also go through records at the local record store. Records released by big corporations. My chances of discovering music that wasn't already famous was very close to zero. What I could hear was extremely limited by either radio stations or the record executives who decided which bands got the opportunity to be on the plastic disks that would have to be expensively made and shipped all over the country.

The DIY punk scene somewhat changed things. But not a lot. It's WAY easier these days to just post your music on ReverbNation or SoundCloud or whatever and send the links to friends. Who's stopping your friends from doing that? I don't know how hard it is to get your music on Spotify, but most of my friends have done it, and they only do music part time and have only hundreds of fans. Nothing like that was possible in the 1980s. A small band like my friends' bands would be heard in a few local bars and that's about it. There simply wasn't a way for the global reach they can easily get on Spotify today.

So your claim that this is something that never happened in history is not very credible. It's actually pretty much the entire history of music up until very recently when technology changed that.

I‚Äôve been recording music with my band Fear 2 Stop for about 20+ years now but minus one release that did well until an issue with ReverbNation caused all our stuff to get pulled (never have a co-worker play your music at from a work pc if using VPN‚Ä¶even if it‚Äôs legit like it was in my case it appeared to them as streaming fraud) . That was a few years ago and never put anything out again until last year when my (now 14 year old ) daughter officially joined up . She wrote a few songs we recorded over the years (started  playing keyboard when she was 7) but a couple of strokes kinda knocked me for a loop for a bit and I was unable to complete anything on my own for about 3 years so she ended up officially joining the band last May. I‚Äôm much better now as far as the writing goes (actually better than ever ) but health wise not so much. Jaymie does want to pursue a path in music so I‚Äôm actually using this as a way for her to get her feet wet learning what it‚Äôs like being in a band and learning the production side of things, but in a band setting with no pressure rather than under her own name until she‚Äôs older so when she does , she‚Äôll already be experienced. Our newest material is our first since she‚Äôs been the primary producer (everything from May onwards) and for the past several months we‚Äôve changed from a somewhat  experimental electronic based sound to a more organic sound (and are no longer entirely instrumental).  So I‚Äôm not just promoting us cause I want us to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù (no idea what my future holds..it‚Äôs not about me at this point )‚Ä¶ I actually am more desperate for feedback than anything else.  Im not really used to not being the head honcho and although I‚Äôm enjoying it actually, I legit have no idea of what we do now is any more or less appealing to people . I hope so. We‚Äôre still gonna be doing our thing regardless (and Jaymie has already said she is more interested in making music for arts sake than commercialism) but at least want people to hear us (hell until 2015 we literally gave our music away)

Sorry for the ramble‚Ä¶.Here we are (note : we are incredibly prolific‚Ä¶ we really have released that many albums since November , although ‚ÄúLoaded Souls‚Äù was our first album entirely of new material (I‚Äôm not playing when I say we‚Äôve been prolific..even counting the hiatus we‚Äôve recorded over 1,200 songs..and that‚Äôs only counting the ones that still have exist)

Way back before Facebook and Twitter, there was MySpace which really was heavily used by unsigned artists. It was originally a great platform (thanks, Tom!), but at that time desktop hard drives lacked processing power, and bandwidth connections were slow and unreliable. Eventually the platform was sold and diversified in order to seek better revenue for investors. I'm pretty sure it's still active though.

SoundCloud kind of took over the mantle, where artists gained access to new tools that enabled songs to be embedded elsewhere online. And could track statistics of plays and followers.

Bandcamp is hugely popular for unsigned acts to upload and digitally distribute their music. It allows fans to follow their favourite acts and makes recommendations based on past listening.

The real issue is that most casual music listeners aren't particularly invested in seeking new sounds, but are content to find it by sheer chance. As a consequence, despite how good they generally are (each with a slightly different offer), platforms like SoundCloud, Bandcamp, MySpace. CDBaby, Guitar9, ReverbNation, etc. don't attract regular large volumes of traffic from non-musicians.

&gt; Underground artists dont make a whole lot of music videos tho and theres lyric videos for everything.......

I know, but I enjoy those 5 songs of each artists, and when there are a lot of them, plus some cover channels that don't put music on spotify, I rather keep them

&gt; Also u can download audio off youtube and save it to ur phone too ya know.....

I did for a while to an ipod but it broke, and my phone for the last like 5 years was only 8MB, so it couldn't hold a lot, SD cards were an option but it seemed like a hassle when I could just have the playlist, I didn't listen too much music outside of my home anyways so I didn't care too much

&gt; And spotify has been aggressively marketing and been part of mainstream culture for some time now. I remember using spotify in 2011....... U didnt know it was a thing 5 years ago? Give me a break... What did u get online for the first time in 2016 or what? Come the fuck on.

Marketing aggressively in the US or other countries, here in Mexico it wasn't that popular or pushed that much, I also didn't care too much since I already had a playlist ready so why would I make the switch or take that much interest in a different platform when one worked just fine

&gt; There are so many goddamn solutions and spotify isnt the only streaming option. If u cant find a certain artist on spotify u can find them on pandora or any other service.

Genuinely don't know what Pandora is, again, I don't care that much either way since it would be very difficult at this point with 500+ songs, and it works fine

&gt; And those really underground artists can put themselves on spotify too. If anything its almost a certainty that they have a reverbnation account. If u really support these underground artists then u would find out where to download and buy their music and put it on ur phone. Thats the whole point of being a musician, to make money doing what u love. If u really love their music ud shell out the 99 cents for the fucking singles and then u will always have it and can listen to it even without wifi.

I have done that, some have patreons, others just drop a soundcloud link, and also, I'm not talking strictly about underground artists when I say ""unknown artists"", there are some channels that just have a cover of another song with an acoustic guitar and I like to have those, they don't ask for money, it's just a cover

&gt; Listening to music with youtube.... God. Even way back in 2009 before we all.had smartphones i didnt use fucking youtube like that. Id get online and use one of those youtube to mp3 converters and then id put all that music on my sd card. Thats how i got my music in college.

Sure, they charge a fee (\~$25 for a song) and take a cut (I think 10-15% is the norm?) but that cut only comes out of any streaming revenue (if there is any).  But that seems pretty reasonable considering the service provided.  And pre-streaming, you'd likely get nothing - no release, zippo.

&gt;Again, not strictly true. Soundcloud and Reverbnation were globally available long before Spotify was, and MySpace was obviously around long before either.

I agree with you here but... in relative terms, hardly anyone uses these platforms.  Combined, if memory serves, Soundcloud and Reverbnation amount to less than 5% of Spotify's user base.  And that number is on the decline.  Without Sirius XM's investment last year, Soundcloud would've gone BK (or been forced to sell, which is probably what will happen anyway).  But, yes, there are alternatives if you simply want your music available for someone to hear (also, Bandcamp, obviously... although downloads are plummeting).

&gt;*But""*, I hear people say, *""Spotify gives you a wider chance to be discovered, and played alongside major artists, so it's not the same!""*

But this is completely true.  Problem is... most ""artists'"" (yes, I hate that term) music just isn't good enough to bother being discovered by the masses.  \[When I say ""good enough"" I'm saying for the genre it occupies and objectively speaking based on the combined views of folks knowledgeable with the genre.\]  That's a mathematical fact that most folks don't want to hear.  And, even if the music is good, it still requires promotion... but that's always been the case.  I find plenty of obscure artists on Spotify that I really like who clearly spend nothing on marketing, which is fine.  These artists would've sold a few hundred self-produced 7"" singles back in the day and otherwise remained obscure... seems all about the same to me; it's certainly not worse.

&gt;It's hard to make an argument on economic or promotional grounds that having your release on Spotify from day 1 is a net positive for a typical musician.

Perhaps, but, again, outside of friends and family, the world doesn't care about the ""typical musician's"" music... so it doesn't really matter what they do.",,,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_n5zkqh,,,False,/r/musicmarketing/comments/n5zkqh/sobering_spotify_stats_from_yearend_2020/gx6kyzg/,public,False,t1_gx6kyzg,,,[],1620326976.0,,0,,,,,,reverbnation,1627975431.0,,,,,1494197109.0,,,,,

Not true. You have to go via a distributor, who takes a cut or a payment. This is important...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; They would've needed a record label's help pre-streaming to get their  music out amongst the masses, which very few would've received 

Again, not strictly true. Soundcloud and Reverbnation were globally available long before Spotify was, and MySpace was obviously around long before either.

It's worrying that Spotify have been able to frame the argument in this way, saying *""look how few gatekeepers there are compared to 'The Past'""* when this is only true when you compare it to the 90s. If you wanted to put your music out on the internet for free there have always been many ways. And if you wanted to charge for it, you could get on iTunes relatively cheaply. 

*""But""*, I hear people say, *""Spotify gives you a wider chance to be discovered, and played alongside major artists, so it's not the same!""* Again, this is overstated. As correctly stated above, over 90% of artists have fewer than 1000 monthly listeners. It's worse than that - when you run the maths, it looks like about three-quarters of artists have fewer than 10 monthly listeners. Many of those people will be on distributors that charge a subscription, so they're *paying to be there*.

So the facts are that you still need help to reach people, because Spotify clearly isn't getting your music out to much of a new audience. It's hard to argue that it's significantly better than, say, Soundcloud, if you're paying $20/year to be there but still only getting 10 monthly listeners. Someone's making more money out of the new system but it isn't the typical independent artist.

Increasingly it seems clear that Spotify needs to be treated in the same way that movies treat TV - as a second-class channel that brings in a little extra cash once the premium channels have already been used.

These  4 turns are reflected in the secret society signs of 79th Ave to SUNGOHD Arena, in Delta, BC, Canada.  Note that HARJGTHEONE DBA, and third turn HARJGTHEONE HARJGILL DBA, and fourth turn, HARJGTHEONE GOHD (HGOHD) can be referred to as H or HARJGTHEONE if you understand Truth of H, Rise of H.  HARJGTHEONE DBA originated on December 11, 1985 along a road from Houston, Texas, which can be referred to a tortuous  --- ( Tea O H are Tea you (2) o H you SSS)  road -  a yellow brick road leading from Kansas because secret societies planned for 1989 Dorthy (D O H are Tea H why) should meet OZ (O H ZZ(sleep)).  HARJGTHEONE DBA first began singing, writing, and playing and recording music in April 2016 having never sang or written or played music before. He published his music on Reverbnation and the music stores worldwide releasing an Album self titled ""HARJGTHEONE DBA"" with six songs. The music was in the top 10 in Reverbnation charts for 31 consecutive months till December 2018 at which point the account was closed by Reverbnation with no proper explanation as they cited a complaint they received of fraud - which would be a false claim.   His music was then uploaded to new distributers and continues to be available in Itunes, Soundcloud (Soundcloud/HGOHD) and on most major music stores.  HARJGTHEONE DBA created the music using Apple's Garageband software.  All the vocals for all his songs as at the writing of this BIO since April 2016 when he began writing, singing, and producing music and up to June 2020 are by HARJGTHEONE DBA with recording completed in Vancouver, BC, Canada in the Vancouver Public Library or in Coffee shops (Waves Coffee House) boardrooms in downtown Vancouver, and recently in 2020 in Toronto, Ontario.

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of it though because users can choose their genre (which is normal), but you have hip-hop playing under Rock - and I just feel it‚Äôs deliberate. Anyhow... the randomness and platform setup is a similar format. 
LUM has a ‚Äúgamification‚Äù element to it as well. Here you can gift badges to artist and you get ‚Äúfree‚Äù tokens for being a member, checking in everyday, and streaming. The more you listen... the more ‚Äúfree‚Äù tokens you get. It‚Äôs like someone took Facebook and Audius and BearStars with a LinkedIn rewards program (All-Star Status if you give them all of your information, for more exposure).  The one thing about LUM, is they have contests, and users can run contests, and the social media platform is a nice change of pace. Members, like BeatStars, can see beats and offer services to be Featured or critique songs... etc.  I can‚Äôt prove it, but there is an algorithm rewards you for how much you interact. They also put stop to spamming, which BeatStars should (hey bro your shit is üî•. (Support me and I‚Äôll support you back. Let‚Äôs work üí™). 
How about: No. 

Their is an inherent problem with all of these platforms, and it‚Äôs the ReverbNation Fallacy.  RN is quite clever in allowing users to choose 3 genres. It‚Äôs part of the ploy to make each one more unique because they expanded the probability ratio. I was #1 local, #1 regional, #32 Nation, #50 global. I had less than 100 plays, less than 100 fans. The secret? Just choose Experimental, Indie, Indie. Because no one is going to choose Indie twice. The problem is the gimmick that ‚Äúlabels‚Äù and ‚Äúsync‚Äù opportunities exist. I mean... how hard is it to set up a LCC and call it DragonFly Records? Call yourself and A&amp;R and tell people to submit songs for the chance at a deal? Charge people to get on the radio (every online radio station has 150,000 - 300,000 listeners a month). There is algorithm with RN, but I‚Äôm so put off by the gimmick, I can‚Äôt bring myself to use it enough to figure it out. Fake fans is one issue. Also, if someone fans you, and go to their profile, click message it says: user is not a fan and cannot message (something like that). Total BS. 

Nonetheless... the Fallacy is that non-music creators don‚Äôt use these apps. Do the math... Spotify has like 80M premium paying, and like 110M free users. 100‚Äôs of Millions make up the rest. How many of these people are listening to these platforms? Music creators don‚Äôt have time to be fans of other creators. At least ones that are putting in the work. There is a sense of community; which is good. But what does it gain me by having 800 plays, 200 followers and following 3.5k? And you usually see lopsided stats like that. Are there real sync opportunities? Sure. But anyone in the game... sync supervisors already have established connections. There‚Äôs an entire market for non-famous musicians, and not a lot of jobs. Studios offer these services. Who is really scouting any of these sites looking for a song to play in the background of this one scene in a Hallmark movie? I‚Äôd be highly disappointed if that system didn‚Äôt already work, and find out that ‚Äúluckily Jim found that one beat in the nick of time, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt have anything‚Äù. 

Any platform that can truly connect creators with fans is going win. They exist... YouTube, Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud, etc.  

Reverse engineer the entire concept. How can general listeners be rewarded for being proactive? I‚Äôve said this a million times: the avid listener wants a story and get intimate with the creators. The casual listener (a majority) don‚Äôt think twice about who, what, when or where. The like a song... playlist it. Move on with their non-music creating lives. They don‚Äôt sit around and talk about music. And everyone hates ‚Äúthat one guy‚Äù that‚Äôs always like... ‚Äúdude you gotta listen to this one song‚Äù.  I mean be real. Music creators think their shit is bomb, and they harass the hell out of everyone they know... and non-creators hate listening to someone else‚Äôs taste in music. What it‚Äôs actually happening in people‚Äôs lives where they‚Äôre like... ‚Äúhey you wanna come over and listen to music?‚Äù 

If you can figure out how to be a Platform that do the one thing that none of them do, reward listeners and simultaneously reward creators. Other than that, any platform you make with gamification that costs creators money for anything... will work. Creators are hopeful, believers, and know they have to be on multiple platforms. Is there a platform that has banned hip-hop? No electronic music? Because that‚Äôs entirely what makes up the entire market: sound banks, loops, plug-ins. I can make dope music on my phone. Okay. Wow... you really nailed that vocal preset that doesn‚Äôt use your real voice. I‚Äôm just saying... an idea would be to limit what can be on a platform, market that platform to that target audience... and bam! But you can‚Äôt just let be a free-for-all, unless you want your platform over ran by 13-24 year olds spitting bars and girls posting pics in their underwear. 

I‚Äôd love to help you make anything that‚Äôs different than what already exists. And yes... I do make electronic music, and do make hip hop, but I am also a guitarist and can see the need for a platform for that‚Äôs tailored to something different.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_ml46wj,,,False,/r/audius/comments/ml46wj/who_wants_to_make_an_audius_client_with_me/gtonlmb/,public,False,t1_gtonlmb,,,[],1617801336.0,,0,,,,,,reverbnation,1628380545.0,,,,,1600881204.0,,,,,

You can't go wrong with more subs (my wife might disagree here). I am running dual 12"" subs in my little room. A ported Klipsch R-112SW @ 300w RMS. And an SVS SB-2000 Pro sealed box @ 550w RMS.

However, you DO need to find an aggregator that supports MFiT  releases of which there are very few.  I know CDbaby will do it if you  contact them, and I've heard reverbnation would as well though I have no  experience there.

Then saw another site that said this:

*""Mastered for iTunes approved aggregators can send your high bit  rate masters to iTunes, but, they can only guarantee that your release  will be branded as ""Mastered for iTunes"" if your work has been mastered  by a Mastered for iTunes Mastering Engineer. When submitting your work  to the aggregator for the MFiT release (bullet 2, above), you also have  to send the aggregator the following information with your release:*

&amp;#x200B;

* *Name of the approved mastering house or studio where your album was mastered for iTunes*
* *Name of your Mastered for iTunes mastering engineer*
* *The email address of your mastering engineer*

*The aggregator I checked with added that the process for submitting  the content is a separate process from having it branded as a Mastered  for iTunes release, and that typically the MFiT branding is added a few  weeks after your album is added to iTunes.""*

I took a look at the [community tab](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Except-After-Sea-6760839427/community/?ref=page_internal) of Except After Sea's Facebook page, and Pete Hill (band member) gave his email to a fan who wanted to download Tiny Game Pieces. Maybe he'll tell you what happened with the band if you reach out to him? If an email or Facebook message doesn't work, you could try contacting him through his [Bandcamp](https://petehillmusic.bandcamp.com/). He uploaded something in December, so he's certainly active there.

Pete was also in a band called Cow Pals, and [its LastFM wiki](https://www.last.fm/music/Cow+Pals/+wiki) page includes the following quote: ""By early 2009, US Funk Team had broken up ***and Except After Sea was headed into a long hiatus due to half the band moving across the country.***"" That probably sums it up right there, but you could still contact Pete if you're curious or just want to say you enjoyed the music.

So yeah here's the thing with music libraries. It can be a tough code to crack but the good news is you don't have to be an established artist although that can help. Back in 2009 I got lucky and was approached by Reverbnation. It wasn't a pay to play type opportunity they were just reaching out to artists who ranked high in their charts from every city and I had the number one slot in Chicago. Basically what went down was they had just partnered up with APM. Now if you check out APM you'll see they have a very deep history in production music. APM is KPM an extremely well established company from the UK and now they're owned by Universal Music Publishing and I think Sony. With that said, this is why I always tell artists to be prepared. At the time I had roughly I think 30 songs to send when they approached me and surprisingly they approved all the tracks. I was sort of a known artist back then I suppose but not huge by no means. Most people knew me for all the loop packs I produced over the years for Sonic Foundry, Loopmasters, and Sony but I didn't have a huge following for my personal music, still don't really to be honest. Also keep in mind back then we didn't have cool social media outlets and tons of places to share our music. So anyway I got this contract with Reverbnation who built up a library from artists on their site and got representation from APM who is more or less a sync agent. Less than a year later I started seeing royalties on my BMI report. Then it just started to snow ball from there. Then because I saw some revenue I got inspired to send them more music and now they have roughly 220 songs from me. I do have more songs with other libraries/publishers/sync agents and I'll get to that in a bit. What does all this mean? Well honestly it was a ""right place at the right time"" kinda situation which is usually how things work especially in this industry but I was also prepared with 30+ songs. With that said I tend to suggest having at least 3 albums worth of material before you start pitching to libraries. Companies like APM, Epidemic, and MusicBed for example are swamped. They're getting new music every day, hundreds of tracks, and thousands each month. It really difficult for them to have an open to submissions type system and even though they say they do odds are they won't ever listen. That's just the hard truth. The key is getting to know someone who can hook you up for lack of better terms but the good news is once you get in it's easier to land publishing contracts with different libraries. Why have music with different libraries? Well what works for some doesn't work for others but I'll tell you from my experience is that they all have different clients and connects. This is why I have music scattered on many different libraries. Currenlty I'm with BMG, Universal/APM, Sony, Downboys, eOne, Epitome, and 5 Alarm to name a handful. Some of them want exclusivity so you can send an album to one and a different album to another and so on. Sometimes they will reach out to your with requests too and then those tracks that you make for the specific request will probably end up exclusive. Which brings me to your question about distribution to Spotify etc. Some libraries like my deal with Reverbnation/APM for example just want exclusivity for the publishing / sync side of things so in this case you can release your music on all platforms and collect 100% of that streaming revenue whereas they will collect their cut on the sync performing rights side of things. Now SOME deals won't let you do that that want to control everything and act as your admin whereas they will release your music for you and collect all revenue and then pay you your cut. I have contracts like that as well. The fact that you did already release your music could potentially limit you to certain libraries based on their agreements in fact it could hurt you in some cases. Recently I got accepted to be part of the new Beatstars deal with Sony for sync and publishing. In that case their backend system actually requires that the tracks were already released and now this is something new to me I've never had a deal like that before. I did send them a handful of tracks to test the waters. Just make sure you read the contracts and agreements in detail before you sign anything. It has been in my experience that the sync world is not as ""controlling"" for lack of a better word in regards to their artist agreements as labels. I would much rather just sign with Universal Music Publishing rather than Universal Music as a label. Labels usually want to own 100% of everything (masters, etc) but my experience with publishing and sync agents has been they mostly just want to admin the sync and publishing side and some of them are even cool with non-exclusive agreements. I have a library of roughly 1000 songs that I call my non-exclusive library and it's scattered around on different libraries and services that are ok with non-exclusive material for example some stock audio sites like Pond 5 and Songtradr for example. You really just have to figure out what works for you. As for PRO I chose BMI. Honestly I can't say anything bad or good about the others like SESAC or ASCAP because I don't have any experience with them but I will say that I co-wrote songs with a friend who is with ASCAP and we split 50/50 and I tend to get paid much sooner for placements than he does.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,True,True,t3_lh19qd,,,False,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/lh19qd/whats_your_day_job/gn03yjf/,public,False,t1_gn03yjf,,,[],1613088993.0,,0,,,,,,reverbnation,1626898727.0,,,,,1354907120.0,,,,,

Thank You so much for the feedback, and for your response. You're super! Don't worry about the experience level too much. I'm more gravitated towards passion and drive rather than skill level. Most of our drums aren't too technical. Pretty straight forward with fills, and maybe a couple of double bass pedal here and there(But this isn't needed). Mainly it's ""feel the music"" so to speak. The song on Reverbnation was a real drummer and he didn't use double bass, so don't let the genre make you intimidated. :) We like the older post-core stuff rather than all of the technical aspects of what it has become in the past 10 years or so. 
Do you have a discord? If so, please feel free to add me. That's where our band server is, where we share our thoughts, ideas, music files, etc..

I released my first album for sale on bandcamp 2 years ago for $6 and no one even bought a pity copy. Even my parents said they would but didn't. The drummer I've worked with for 10 years *still* won't get gmail, so he can't listen to the demos we do for him to learn. Every single time he tells us to send something he either can't get it because it's too big for hotmail or he just doesn't listen, then comes to practice and has to learn it from scratch.

And of course I used to always be encouraging my muso friends to send me what they did but they don't do anything ever, so really they don't understand how important your creations are as they've never created anything themselves, which I find utterly bizarre. I've got one friend who does his own stuff (well, used to) but I'm the one who has it all archived because I'm more interested in it than he is. He still doesn't listen to anything of mine.

There are many bigger villains out there, such as e.g. ticket scalpers, rogue management organisations, unaccredited summer tuition camps, and some of the budget recording facilities.

Spotify is designed around listeners, not creators. And for the listener it provides a slick, easy to navigate platform. IMO its major drawback (in common with other online services) is its audio compression, which may account for why its audience are mainly clustered in certain younger demographics and pop styles, rather than the older listeners of ""serious"" music. (Just compare monthly listeners: Ed Sheeran's 50 million; Kanye's 33 million; Gustav Mahler's 800 thousand; Stephen Sondheim's 270 thousand). Essentially, live music sounds best, then vinyl, and then there's a massive gap in the audio experience when you listen to radio or streaming.

Much of my own most recent composition work has been easy listening smooth jazz instrumentals, intended for background ambience in bars, restaurants, and retail environments. So if I pick up a few streaming listeners as well, that's a bonus.

In the past I've had my tracks available on Myspace, ReverbNation, Soundcloud, Bandcamp and probably a few others that I've forgotten.

It is beyond infuriating when you are working with musicians (in a band, online collabs, or wherever else), and you are clearly not on the same wavelength as the rest of the group. I'll go on a bit of a rant here for a bit...  


My one guitar teacher always instilled one key factor: ALWAYS know where beat one is in the measure, be sure to tap your foot with a metronome, and lock in to the beat. He is a phenomenal player who is very well versed in jazz, funk, blues, and rock. He's from a background where he knows his theory, has a great sense of groove, and lock into the groove with ANY group of musicians. I've definitely learnt a LOT when I took lessons from him.  


Fast forward to late last year/beginnin of this year, and I joined this one local band who was ""looking for a guitarist with studio experience."" I message the drummer on FB since he was (and still is) on my friend's list, and we meet up. We jam twice before I officially join, and it's a 3-piece outfit consisting of me, a bassist, and drummer. Their original guitarist (and former lead singer) left the band, so we were singer-less.  


The more I played with them, the more apparent in became to me how I was the big fish in a small pond, and I was the youngest member by 15 years (I'm 25 as of this comment). The bassist alternated between bass and guitar, and some of the riffs he wrote, he could barely play once the drummer and I started playing. For instance, bassist wrote a riff that was clearly in 6/4 time, the drummer played a slightly off groove that fit the pattern, and the bassist kept flubbing up. The drummer and I locked into it, but once the bassist joined in, he lost time of HIS OWN RIFF, and the two of them said ""I had the timing issues.""  


We had no luck finding a singer (an acquaitnace of mine auditioned, and he said that I was too good for the other guys), and the bassist wanted to become the lead singer since he wrote 2 of the songs before I joined the band. The only problem? He could barely play bass, wasn't that great of a singer, and couldn't do both together at the same time.  


When it came to recording our first song, it was VERY off time. It had a long bass intro that ended on a fade and a count in from the drummer. Since the singer couldn't play bass at the same time, we started at the count in, and there were some parts where the drummer would change tempos very quickly. Why's that? The drummer could NOT play to a metronome at all, and he followed the singer for the changes between sections. I would follow the drummer since I had no click (and I knew the song like the back of my hand), and I would have to adjust whenever the singer sped up too quick. After the initial tracking ended, the singer went in and recorded bass for the song, and by God, the bass intro where it's just him was so ungodly out of time, it was brutal for me to mix it.  


I painstakingly mix the song, and the drummer sends it to reverbnation to get distributed as well as to a local radio station for it to be posted on the ""Locals Only"" block they do on Sundays. My friends, family, and coworkers in the area listened to it, and the general consensus was ""Dude, why are you with them, you're too good?""   


Jump ahead another month, and I gave these guys more than enough notice that for 2 separate weekends (Fri-Sun), I'll be with my mom in Philly helping her as she was recovering from a bone marrow transplant (to which she is now 100% clear from Leukemia), and that I'll be working Mon-Thurs those weeks, so practices would be Mon-Thurs and later. They wanted to get a second song recorded and released right after the second weekend, and I reinstated that I would be busy, but I would get all of my parts (guitars AND bass now) recorded to a click for them to record on.  


I recorded my parts, and I was tight with the click, bring it to a practice, and the drummer says ""I can't record to this, there's timing issues."" I told him ""yeah, my ass, line it up to a click track, and you'll see it's tight."" He then says that he can't record to a click or pre-recorded track (yet, he coincidentally wanted to do an online collab in this one music group we're in on facebook), and I redid all of my parts. I ended leaving the band during this period, and they claimed ""they didn't know I would be gone during those weekends,"" and ""didn't know my mom was sick"" despite me telling them that, and the drummer reacting to statuses about a benefit we were going to do for my mom to raise money for medical bills, etc.  


Tl:DR --&gt; I was in a band where the bassist wrote lyrics, but couldn't play/sing at the same time, and both him and the drummer could barely play in time without messing up. When it came to recording, both of them were afraid of the click and were way off time (despite the drummer playing for almost 20 years), and made it out to be like I was the problem. Funnily enough, the guy they had replace me on guitar? They were trashing him at one of our practices because ""fat boy always goes live on facebook acting like he can sing,"" yet the new guitarist is a phenomenal musician compared to them.

The website describes itself as ""[a music business education and **artist advocacy company** focusing on empowering musicians to have successful careers in the new music business](https://aristake.com/about/).""  (Emphasis mine.)  So, yes, the website is ""biased"" in the sense that it is advocating for a particular perspective.  Much like how you appear to be biased against websites exerting social pressure on companies to specifically support racial justice movements.

&gt; Check out this article. They sent letters to a ton of music companies including Amazon and Apple music demanding they make a statement of obeisance and donate money to the black lives matter movement. They then took pictures of all the CEOs that didn't and posted ""These people don't care about black lives"" as if not donating to a highly partisan political organization is tantamount to not caring about black people.

As another person has already noted, this is a pretty serious misrepresentation of the substance of your linked article.  They didn't ""demand"" any statements or donations.  They simply *asked* whether the companies made any.

As for your claim that they ""took pictures of all the CEOs that didn't and posted 'These people don't care about black lives,'"" that's plainly false.  The photos are of the managing staff of *one* specific company (ReverbNation) that stood out from all of the companies they surveyed.  Moreover, the focus of the article is--contrary to your characterization--entirely on that company.  Note that the headline is ""*This Music Company* Doesn‚Äôt Care About Black Lives,"" *not*, as you claim, ""These people . . . .""  (Emphasis mine.)

&gt; This is a literal shakedown.

That's just like, your opinion, man.

I guess there's a fair argument that it's a ""hit piece"" on ReverbNation, but one person's hit piece is another person's expos√©.  Obviously, it's your prerogative to view and criticize it as the former.

&gt; They sent letters to a ton of music companies including Amazon and Apple music demanding they make a statement of obeisance and donate money to the black lives matter movement. 

The quote from the article:

&gt; I was curious to see which companies actually participated in the day, issued statements acknowledging the Black Lives Matter movement and who donated (or enabled their customers to donate) to causes that support racial justice. We compiled a list of over 100 companies in music and asked them. 

They did not ""demand"" anyone make a statement or donate money, they simply *asked* companies whether or not they did.

&gt;They then took pictures of all the CEOs that didn't and posted ""These people don't care about black lives"" as if not donating to a highly partisan political organization is tantamount to not caring about black people. This is a literal shakedown.

No. Again, this is an extremely misleading way to summarize the article. They posted the CEOs of one particular company (ReverbNation) which is the focus of 95% article. The article you linked details why they specifically felt it was necessary to discuss ReverbNation, but even if you think this call-out was unjustified it is entirely false to claim they posted ""all the CEOs"" that didn't support the black lives matter movement. 

They also asked companies whether they donated to the movement in general, not Black Lives Matter the organization, so again it's false to claim they demanded companies endorse ""a highly partisan political organization"" (not really sure what's partisan about arguing that black people shouldn't be murdered for no reason, but we can leave that aside).

&gt; You can see only the larger companies resisted because they have the political power to resist. Apple and Amazon are both very woke so I doubt they resisted because they don't care about black lives. 

According to the article you linked, Amazon music and Apple music both made a statement and donated money. I don't really see how that's ""resisting"". And for the record, those companies do not care about black lives. No company does. Companies make the decisions that they think will return the most profit. That's not an accusation, that's just what a company is. We shouldn't expect them to care because that's not what companies do. 

&gt;The sad thing is that small companies that don't make billions can be easily cowed by this shakedown and have to choice but to pay what is essentially protection money. 

There's really no evidence of this article, so this is just conjecture. And again, they did not ask companies to do anything, they just made a list of who did what in an article that focused on one particular company. There is no evidence of anyone being extorted. All of which leads me to question why you felt you need to make this comment in this first place.

&gt;I get people think this is a good cause but the tactics are shameful.

The clear implication of saying that some people ""think"" this is a good cause is that you don't. This is an attempt to ignore the experiences of black artists with simple whataboutism.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so. 

&gt; Formed In: April 2012
Hometown Location: Hessle, UK and Portage, IN.

Are you familiar with DistroKid or similar services? They act as a go between to publish music to streaming services and stores because Apple, Spotify, etc want to deal with distributors and not artists directly on the business end because of the nature of things like royalties and such like. 

DistroKid I know have a feature to upload cover material but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a sure thing or if there is a chance the rights holder can reject your cover. Putting out cover versions as real releases has more legal hoops to jump through and not all services off that. DistroKid is the best path I know of to investigate though.

There are other options for publishing to streaming sites you can check out too like Ditto Music, Tunecore, CDBaby or Reverbnation.

Definitely check out [Sky vs Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3x8VY9mEmo). It's kinda tragic these guys didn't get more attention. Recommended for fans of TREOS, Of Machines, Saosin.

One of my favorite bands was a band that never actually officially released their ep: [Cynosure](https://soundcloud.com/wearecynosure/a-constant-state-of-becoming-1). Their publicly released stuff is only on their soundcloud (or I guess [reverbnation](https://www.reverbnation.com/cynosuremusic/songs) for their early demo with previous singer). Recommended for fans of Saosin, Secret and Whisper.

Another similarly sounding, similarly short-lived band: [Acrasia](https://soundcloud.com/nico-douglas/acrasia-glass-houses-copyright)

Jesse Smith - Drums

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's Rishloo continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool, and Fair to Midland, Rishloo strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of Rishloo. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as Rishloo. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, Rishloo have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation, and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, Rishloo continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata, and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released December 2014.

Just to add my own personal experience that might shed light on how this type of thing can pan out over time, I posted a music video my brother and I made to r/videos last year in May which peaked at just over 20k upvotes. If I'm remembering correctly, in 24 hrs we got about 150k YT plays and +900 subscribers. Our IG subs only went up by about 20-30, but people also went to our Spotify and streamed the song a bunch. The influx of people to our Spotify put us on some algorithmic playlists which boosted our plays even more and exposed us to a wider audience. I think our first month after the video got popular we had about 30k listeners. 9 months later, we're still averaging about 10k listeners a month on Spotify and the song that got popular will likely pass the 300k plays mark within the next couple weeks. This is almost double what our YouTube views on the song are (as the YT plays died down after a couple weeks) despite the fact that our video was what actually got popular at the beginning. For context, before the post on r/videos got popular, we had less than 50 monthly listeners and none of our songs had passed the 1,000 play mark. 

It's interesting to see how your results and ours skewed differently across platforms. Our Instagram barely got any attention at all, even though we had it listed in our video description.

Whoever was in charge of archival and preservation messed up. I'd go as far as to say, hundreds of artists may have been lost due to negligence by Vampirefreaks staff.

Many composers' pieces can give an inkling into their psyche. Rachmaninoff often seems to give a sense of loneliness and separation, for example. Given a lot of his work was seen as unfashionable at the time, and how he had to flee Russia following the communist revolution, it is understandable he might channel those feelings into his works.

Yeah, it is fun learning to play like other musicians to add to your vocabulary. Though I was a big Jaco nerd for a number of years, and learned some of his stuff, I kept trying to take in various influences for flexibility.

I tend to prefer plucking over the neck pickup for a slightly warmer sound when paired with a tone biased to the mids to round things out, but my right hand technique was certainly influenced by Jaco's firm plucking near the bridge when doing his signature 16th note grooves.

That is a great rendition of Scuttle Buttin! You definitely have the right technique and feel for this tune, and have excellent dynamic articulation. Great tone, too! What gauge strings are you using?

I saw quite an interesting video lately on Rick Beato's channel where he found that the common idea of a heavier string gauge giving better tone (at least in overdriven stuff) doesn't ring true under tests.

Turned out lighter gauge strings gave a more coherent midrange, which is exactly where you want the guitar in a mix, and a tighter bottom end so that less aggressive EQ'ing is required.

SRV was famed for using 13s of course, but dropped down to 11s after he found they actually sounded better while still giving a decent feel for more heavy handed playing.

I tend to stick to 10s on my strat-clone by Vintage (gives MiM Fenders a surprisingly good run for their money at a much cheaper price) as anything lighter feels too light for me. I tend to use 12s on my acoustics, but sometimes 13s if I want to play some Preston Reed stuff.

Haha, that tune made with the robotic noises is very interesting! Must be fun to experiment in taking various recordings of objects and making music from them.

Love that final tune, though. Good production, too. Nice and mellow but the synconpation in the melody gives it more momentum. Shame about Soundcloud's compression and bitrate, though. Sounds like it could be a bit more open sounding in the original master.

Listening on my prized pair of AKG Q701 headphones through a Dragonfly Black USB DAC. Lucked out in that a local recording engineer was selling these headphones for less than a third of their original price on a local craigslist-style site. Need a fair amount of gain to drive them, though.

How did you go about learning to produce? The courses in college I had were unfortunately fairly lacklustre, didn't even cover making sure not to have oversaturation of any frequency bands so that you don't end up with mush. Often I found some of my fellow musicians finding a guitar or bass tone that sounded great solo, but would just ruin a mix without a lot of tweaking.

I guess I just need to focus on doing many recordings, and creating projects while digesting info from pros like Rick Beato, and just getting used to my new DAW (Reaper). The two tunes on my reverbnation account were recorded with an old Zoom H4 stereo mic unit into Sonar (which I got in a 90% off sale) which is a pain to use compared to Pro Tools or Cubase.

Was juggling so much at the time that I recorded both tracks in one take and barely processed anything. They definitely deserve better recordings...

I think you are on a good path from what I have heard from you! :)

Edit: Btw, your Ocarina of Time cover is fantastic! Has got a bit of a My Vitriol vibe to it. Love it.

Double edit: Found an old recording of when I played bass for the Scottish guitarist Lyle Watt:

https://youtu.be/2AGgzmo1pEg

&gt; N.O.H.A. is a band founded in 1995, by leader Philip Noha (b. Prague, Czech Republic) and Chevalier Hadley (b. NYC, NY, USA - aka Chevy).

&gt; N.O.H.A. stands for 'Noise of Human Art' - Noha and Chevy have been the key figures of the project through its entire existence.  The band is characteristic by its open genre-mixture of drum&amp;bass, world music and energy loaded grooves. Hits like Balkan Hot Step, Pijama, Dive in your life, Base From Above and primarily Tu Caf√© brought the band to the biggest European festival stages, for example: Eurospotting-Kopenhagen, Bourges Festival, Roxy-Istanbul, Electronic Beats Festival (supporting Prodigy), Roots Festival-Amsterdam, Espantapitas Festival, Rock For People, Exit, Pohoda, Colours of Ostrava, PopKomm, Rolling Stone Roadshow, Bizarre Festival, Nancy-Jazz Festival, Funkhaus Europa-Festival etc. When on stage, N.O.H.A. stands out as a living, breathing tornado and it emits highly infectious positive energy surfing from the atmosphere to the stage, which has been proven by countless reactions to shows in numerous festivals this year alone, in the Old continent. With its evident fondness for traditional music and multicultural approach N.O.H.A. crushes the boarders between different music genres and continents and thus connects naturally dynamical loaded groove with lively, joyful and playful performance. This is now even augmented by the presence of Brazil singer and guitar player Camila De Oliveira, whose enchanting voice and very distinctive latin-punk feeling adds new dimension to both the music and live shows of N.O.H.A..

&gt; Camila studied singing, film music and music production at Tom Jobim Academy in S√£o Paulo. She lived alternately in Sweden, Denmark, Brazil, India and Israel. This background might be the reason, why can she offer her voice in so many different levels and so maturely in the age of just 27 and why the strong impact her presence has on recent song writing and lyric writing process within the project.  At the end of last summer Camila reached Prague after long travel and probably has been so surprised by local winter that she literally freezed until early spring, when she met Philip Noha.  After couple of common jam-sessions it was more than clear that their mutual collaboration is perfect, although they come from different cultures and backgrounds. Therefore, Philip offered Camila to become a member of N.O.H.A.. Camila agreed and very successful summer tour followed, when the band day after day and show after show surprised its audience with never-ending load of emotions, joy from the show itself, with energetic on-stage appearance and very lively performance. In a very short time Camila became a new voice of N.O.H.A.

&gt; N.O.H.A. Noise Of Human Art, Circus Underground  is: 

&gt; - MC Chevy (New York, USA), project¬¥s co-founder, band's ‚Äúsoul‚Äù, lyricist, integral part of N.O.H.A. imparting its charisma, voice, living power and energy to the project 

&gt; - Camila de Oliveira (S√£o Paulo, BRA), singer, guitar player, song-writer and lyricist, band¬¥s ‚Äúvoice‚Äù, new face of the project, globetrotter filled with inspiration of culture from all over the world. Through N.O.H.A. she passes this inspiration on her audience both on stage and in the studio 

&gt; - Philip Noha (Prague, CZ), founder of the project, band¬¥s ‚Äúhead‚Äù, composer, producer and saxophone player setting its direction throughout entire existence of N.O.H.A. It was his composition and production of songs like ‚ÄúBalkan Hot Step‚Äù or ‚ÄúTu Caf√©‚Äù which moved N.O.H.A. to its current level

&gt; - Thom Herian (Prague, CZ), sensational Czech drummer and band's beating ‚Äúheart‚Äù. Only few drum-kit players in the world play live drum and bass like Thom does. His performance is a special experience not limited to musical enjoyment

&gt; - Jatrabass (CZ), band¬¥s ‚Äûliver‚Äú, bass guitar and double bass. Like its equivalent in human body, Jatrabass also filters just the elements needed for band¬¥s musical blood and its bloodstream. Precision and excellent coordination with the drum-kit make for band¬¥s extraordinary groove station. 

&gt; To its live shows N.O.H.A. regularly invites different guests, for example beat-boxer Skiller (BG) or vocalists Charlie One (UK) or Susi Gamboa (CZ). During its relatively long existence (founded in 1995) project proved itself as a very stable musical entity which overcame two changes on the singer post (Sam Leigh Bown from UK and Minerva Diaz Per√©z from Germany) and managed to refresh its potential with new singer Camila de Oliveira (BRA), drum-kit player Thom Herian and bassist Jatrabass. In turn, these three pushed the band at 
least a level higher. As the numerous reviews in both printed and electronic media may prove, the band is currently in its best configuration since it was founded and reactions of its fans are in the similar tone. You will have the opportunity to hear first new tracks of creative set Philip Noha, Camila De Oliveira, MC Chevy and Thom Herian on band's fall tour.

About the test part, take a look at this: https://www.tunecore.com/artist-services/get-reviewed
It‚Äôs exactly what you say, getting feedback from users to improve your music. There are other options, I believe Reverbnation offers A similar service. I have only tested a review service once, so I don‚Äôt use them. Every service costs extra money... but that‚Äôs a different problem.

About the toolchain, I‚Äôve used most major DAWs over time, in the last few years I‚Äôve settled to Live. Thinking outside the ‚Äúinner loop‚Äù (to put it in developer terms), there are a number of things I do that could be automated. For instance, after exporting a master .wav, I might want to compress it to mp3, fill the id3 info and upload it somewhere. Alternatively, I might want to upload the uncompressed wav to SoundCloud for ‚Äúreview‚Äù by friends. All that would only be within my ‚Äútest environment‚Äù. But it could be the case that I mastered 5 songs of my latest EP, and then I‚Äôd need to publish (to production!) by uploading to Bandcamp or a distributor (e.g. CDBaby, RecordUnion, etc.).

I sometimes automate a few things (I scripted a Mac service that calls ffmpeg to compress to mp3 with a few id3 tag fields completed), but mostly everything is manual.

Anyhow, I think there are several opportunities for automation, specially if they could be DAW agnostic.

I think the same thing: that there are many people out there along a wide spectrum of singing skills that are making their own recordings and finding an audience.

Does it express what you have always felt but couldn't find the words for? You will find someone on SoundCloud, Reverbnation, YouTube, etc. who expresses themselves in a way that pierces to your heart, and they may not necessarily be skilled singers, BUT! They expressed what was on their heart and found a following. That's what I think singing is all about. The OP is correct: Everyone has a singing voice of some kind. Your voice IS an instrument.

Jesse Smith - Drums

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's Rishloo continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool, and Fair to Midland, Rishloo strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of Rishloo. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as Rishloo. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, Rishloo have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation, and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, Rishloo continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata, and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released December 2014.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so.

&gt; Aperco is a progressive rock band from Tel-Aviv Israel, formed in 2013.
Aperco has consistently incorporated prog-rock, hard rock and classical influences into their usually lengthy compositions.

&gt; Aperco's music is simple, melodic and catchy, so that anyone can relate to. But, there is a certain musical element of the band's music, that can be only found in the early 70's records.

&gt; Aperco was originally formed in 2005 by guitarist/vocalist Tom Maizel and keyboardist Tal Maizel, cousins who shared their love for Pink Floyd's darkened ambience, Mike Oldfield's atmospheric soundscapes and Camel's cheerful melodies. Together they began to write some of the raw material that would evantually see the light of day on Aperco's upcoming debut album: ""The Battle""(to be released in 2016). Tom's appeal towards moody, anthemic epics and Tal's sense of celtic melody lines created a unique, yet to be heard combination of musical sophistication for the masses.

&gt; In 2013 Aperco was joined by bassist Yuval Raz, a family relative.
When the three spent the next year rehearsing and writing new material, Aperco was ofiicially born.

&gt; In 2014 Aperco began recording their debut album with producer Gidon Ricardo at Muzeex Productions studio. For the drum parts Aperco recruited Dor Adar as a full time member, a long time friend of the band. The music slowly evolved and more instruments were needed to perform it.

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's Rishloo continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool, and Fair to Midland, Rishloo strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of Rishloo. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as Rishloo. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, Rishloo have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation, and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, Rishloo continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata, and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released December 2014.

They‚Äôre the same thing. GarageBand comes with a smaller subset of the Apple Loops included in Logic. I‚Äôve heard many of them come from older sample/loop libraries, but I can‚Äôt verify that. I‚Äôve always wanted to meet the musicians behind Apple Loops.

Preface: It‚Äôs not *as* egregious as I remember. In the process of writing what‚Äôs below and listening to some of the original loops I have access to, I went back to the Bastion OST to compare. Very different from how I remember it. It‚Äôs still very much filled with stock melodies, overused drum loops, and ‚Äúlibrary records‚Äù. But it‚Äôs different from my memory of playing the game. I think both the years and the sorrow over the loss of a friend have colored my memories. There‚Äôs a belief that every time you tell a story, your brain‚Äôs not remembering the original event but rather the last time you told the story. I apologize for that. 

Back to what I was writing.

Just woke up. Gonna take me a while to find *everything* because this was all a long time ago and my external hard drive from that era makes a clicking sound whenever I turn it on. Haven‚Äôt tried in almost 10 years. Along with a giant library of Big Fish Audio royalty free stock sounds, there‚Äôs a ton of music Mumblez gave me on there, (including songs by Royce Da 5‚Äô9‚Äù that still haven‚Äôt been released).

But for now, some of the loops used in Bastion you can hear versions of right here on Mumblez‚Äô old soundclick account:
https://www.soundclick.com/artist/default.cfm?bandID=544998&amp;content=overview

*The Mancer‚Äôs Dilemma*, for example, uses the GarageBand Loop *Orchestra Harp Pattern 20* as the backbone of the song, then adds in the loop Mumblez used in *017*. 

Keep in mind that DJ Mumblez died in March of 2009, so these tracks had to have been uploaded by March 14th 2009 at the absolute latest. I remember him posting these long before that, however. During the ‚Äúgood‚Äù days.

{Date Proof: If you want proof of his death date, there‚Äôs an old tribute video of sorts on YouTube. I‚Äôd link something else, but a lot of his social media like his Twitter was deleted by probably family after he died, and many of the websites, BBS, and forums he moderates and practically lived on no longer exist. WARNING, he was very sick, severely emaciated, days numbered, and was drinking in this video. It‚Äôs not pretty to watch. Really upsetting for me. I guess he was trying to live it up as much as he still could from his bed and was putting a brave face on things for anyone tuning in on JTV.  https://youtu.be/nu0Dnh7cF1U }

Most of what I wrote below was taking a meal break from work: 
One of the big problems this soundtrack has is unoriginal sound design. Everything sounds like a loop I‚Äôve heard in one place layered with a loop I heard in another. 

*Slinger‚Äôs Song* sounds like something I‚Äôve heard a hundred times. Couldn‚Äôt put my finger on where. Didn‚Äôt find what I was looking for, but with a little Googling I did find out it‚Äôs another Garage Band loop. Listen to https://youtu.be/JNOAFGIkGoc The creator of *that* version, Griffin McElroy stated on a podcast that the Bastion composer used the same GarageBand loops.

Another example cited by fans of The Adventure Zone is the Apple Loop 10 seconds into *The Clock Strikes Noon (Apocalypse!)* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axsIHk-742A) is an exact match for the Apple Loop used 1:35 into *Bynn The Breaker* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrndRM9thzg). 

(Apparently there are also some similarities between *Amnesty Theme* and *A Proper Story‚Ä¢, but I haven‚Äôt checked that one myself. Long story short, both of those guys use Logic, so it‚Äôs a lot of GarageBand Loops forming the backbone of the music.)

*Faith of Jevel* gets it‚Äôs entire rhythm arrangement from a pair of Apple Loops called *Trip Hop Darkness Beat 01* and *Trip Hop Darkness Beat 02*. Like many Apple Loops, it‚Äôs not just audio but actually midi data attached to an instrument preset (in this case *Trip Hop Remix Phaser*). So since he had access to the notes, he could have changed the ‚Äòvoice‚Äô to another set of drum samples. But in this particular case he doesn‚Äôt, leaves the sound design the way he found it, and just removes the samples mapped to the notes C5, E5, and F#5. This is typical of the Bastion soundtrack. He‚Äôs re-arranging other peoples‚Äô musical compositions without changing the sound design. 

*Terminal March* to me sounds like a lot of stock music I‚Äôve heard over the years. From the risers to the ‚Äòfx transition‚Äô sounds to that one old drum loop that the *The Matrix* and countless PSX-era games made so ubiquitous. 

Actually, that‚Äôs most of the Bastion soundtrack, upon a second listen. Those same heavy, over-used stock drum loops combined with your typical risers and transitions every 8 to 16 bars.

And that‚Äôs sort of my gripe. Yes, it‚Äôs a wildly successful execution of a given task: provide background music to set the mood in a video game. But it‚Äôs less of an exercise in *composition* and more of an exercise in *arrangement*. The soundtrack should say ‚ÄúArranged by so and so‚Äù and not ‚ÄúComposed by so and so‚Äù. Because to my ear, the only original audio elements are the vocals. Which are fantastic, btw. I just don‚Äôt hear any original guitar work or keys or any instruments at all being played in here.

At this juncture I can only remember *some* of the environments and set pieces of Bastion as, I‚Äôm playing the music right now. Mostly it‚Äôs just the fantastic narrator. So stripped away from all those positive associations, amazing visuals, and nostalgia ‚Äî I‚Äôm finding the music to be *very* homogenous and just‚Ä¶ stock. Very stock. I can hear how it‚Äôs all been put together. Block by block. Loop by loop.

Even if I can‚Äôt identify every single Apple Loop used in Bastion by memory, I *know* how Apple Loops sound. They have a particularly distinct sound because the audio-based loops were all recorded by the same pool of players (i.e. many of the countless guitar loops sound alike because it‚Äôs the same guitarist using the same guitar in the same studio session) and the midi-based loops all use the same Logic instrument ‚Äòvoices‚Äô (which I‚Äôm very familiar with from years of picking out orchestral ‚Äòvoices‚Äô for keyboard-based producers to use in their studio sessions).

There was at least one track from the game I wasn‚Äôt hearing on the OST. It‚Äôs one of the ones that Mumblez also used. I looked into it and basically it‚Äôs one of those deals where because the music is in a video game, it‚Äôs programmed contextually. ‚ÄúProcessed‚Äù versions. Certain parts loop throughout the game. Certain loops will be heard again and again in different musical contexts. Like themes. The way you hear songs on the soundtrack isn‚Äôt necessarily how you hear them in game. And there‚Äôs some music from Bastion I don‚Äôt believe was included on the OST, but I‚Äôll have to take some time off to do the digging myself. The soundtracks to games typically have idealized versions in a more polished and traditional song structure. That‚Äôs definitely the case here.

All in all, I think the process of writing this has healed some of the hurt I‚Äôve associated with feelings about the ‚Äòoriginality‚Äô of the Bastion‚Äôs stock music soundtrack. Hurt over my dear friend never getting to have the opportunity to grow into a music producer because he was quite simply running out of time. So I‚Äôm gonna try to just put all this behind me, smile, and deal with it. If other people like this kind of paint-by-numbers thing, who cares? Let them. The guy who did the music for this game did a great job of arranging it and putting the whole product together. It‚Äôs just not my cup of tea. I‚Äôve been very careful not to use his name here (or even learn it) so that I‚Äôm not putting out negative energy towards him personally. I hope I‚Äôm very clear about that. My critique is with the work and the artistry, not at all with the guy behind it ‚Äî just a regular person like you and me.

This brief re-analysis has me interested in an unrecognized genre of music that was *very* prominent during that 2005 to 2011 time period: Garage Band Music. A lot of it was made by amateurs and doesn‚Äôt exist anymore because the websites that hosted it no longer exist. From the big ones like MySpace to the more niche ones like ViRB. (Thank God for SoundClick and ReverbNation still being a thing ‚Äî but for how much longer?). In particular, my favorite was *Dj Mysterious Mixtape Vol. .5*, which also shares a few GarageBand Loops with the Bastion soundtrack.

You have bandcamp and reverbnation etc which were mostly about trying to mirror content between social networks, so a band didn't have to re-upload everything everywhere.

Most of these functions can be done with API but there are a few areas where the networks tried to restrict access so that they could be predated on or poached by another network.

Events...

Almost everything on Facebook had an API but events was conspicuously missing. They wanted bands to start posting those events on Facebook and didn't want MySpace to then have them also. You ended up with desktop spammer software being needed to copy events from one network to another.

So, your main talent and passion is producing.  How much time/effort do you want to put into marketing/branding/hype?  Some producers want a secondary entity to do it for them;  could be an agency, could just be a friend and partner (for example, I was in a DJ crew of 3, I personally was most interested in promoting and marketing, so I enjoyed spending time learning that and doing it.  The other two in the crew didn't do much in the way of promo.)

If you're going to do things yourself, here's where I would start:

Learn Wordpress.  Learn how to have a website and learn how to edit it to easily add beats for sale and ways to connect for collabs.  I invision a page that has many of your samples, plays embedded audio, click buttons to add to cart and buy.  You'll want to learn how to edit this stuff yourself.

Social Media:  Start profiles on Twitter, Soundcloud, Reverbnation, Youtube, TikTok, Instagram.   I believe these sites specifically will be where you may want to focus your efforts.  Secondary would be Facebook, Pinterest, Linkedin.

I recommend looking into the many promotion options reverbnation offers.  There are so many interesting unique ways of promo on that site, it's worth looking into what's possible.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so.

When I recently started releasing about 49 of my existing tracks (were on soundcloud already) through Distrokid, the very first track apparently got 'recejected by stores'. I got the same message as this guy:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/7uqzfi/distrokid\_the\_stores\_rejected\_your\_release/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/7uqzfi/distrokid_the_stores_rejected_your_release/)

Sounds like Distrokid officially claim the stores rejected the songs, but it is actually Distrokid checking and rejecting them.

Now what was really frustrating is that I had to find this out in a completely different way. I had actually contacted them about a problem with a different (not rejected) song. I had found a bug in their song upload form that would seemingly auto-correct part of the song title (from *Im* to *I'm*) even though it shouldn't. I was just trying to report this bug and asking them to fix it.

But instead of answering my request, the service guy just kept going on about the rejected release (which at no point I had asked about).

It took me 5(!) mails until he finally responded to my *actual* request:

&gt;I appreciate you letting me know, we are aware of the issue with Im being changed to I'm, but since stores are no longer accepting releases from you via DistroKid, I can't do anything to help with your technical issue. You‚Äôll need to try another distributor for your releases.

So what they're essentially saying is they ignore bugs if they're reported by artists they rejected.

&gt;Since we've been notified by stores and streaming services that one or more of your releases has been rejected due to editorial discretion, stores are no longer accepting releases from you via DistroKid. You‚Äôll need to try another distributor for your releases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, please understand that DistroKid is unable to assist with reversing this. We have no other information or context, and we are unable to get involved or take sides when this occurs. We‚Äôre just the messenger, passing along this info to you in hopes you find it helpful.  
&gt;  
&gt;We wish you the best of luck moving forward with another distributor.

In their previous mail you can see the same incoherent logic (that the guy in the other reddit post experienced), claiming that stores would no longer accept my releases through Distrokid but through other distributors.

What struck me the most is why a distributor would just completely and finally reject a paying customer for a rejected song. How does that fit into their business model?

Anyway, I subscribed at ditto instead and that was a great decision.

I found them through [this top 10 list](https://www.productionmusiclive.com/blogs/news/top-10-music-distribution-services-cd-baby-vs-distrokid-vs-tunecore-vs-others) and the only other ones there with a similar subscription-based model were LANDR and Reverbnation (well and Distrokid, of course).

The things I like about ditto:

* The whole UI of the upload form is better, more modern and responsive, and I can leave it anytime to continue working on it or finally publish (takes up to 10 days) it later.
* You can skip any step to fill out later
* What's also great is that they have lots of electronic subgenres whereas Distrokid barely had any.

So, yesterday my first 3 tracks released on Spotify and a few other stores I chose!

After the Distrokid desaster I'm still a bit wary, so I'm pushing them in small batches. But I just did a quick google search and found no reports of song rejection on ditto (whereas you find multiple entries regarding Distrokid), which is reassuring.

Sites like youtube &amp; reverbnation, get an account everywhere to see which one works for you or get a website of your own.

Facebook, everything from a group and page to talking to musicians not to mention posting links where there is room (spamming).

Try to get your tracks placed on a playlist or use submithub.

Talking to people with music blogs or people who does music reviews that people read or listens to (podcasts).

Performing live.

Get live on the air, real life radio without messing up.

Companies like for example LANDR that covers most things regarding releases.

Free downloads like projects posted to mixtapefactory.com or EP's.

Being on other peoples tracks, because they need the backup and you need the exposure not to mention it's the coolest move ;D

Talking to record companies and hand them a demo.

Playlist submissions are supposed work in todays music biz, selling music at shows is a good way to build a fanbase not to mention a quick way to make some money as well. 

I was thinking about e-mailing some bloggers and post the links with photos and info to some music reviews not to mention the fact that sites like Soundcloud and Reverbnation can help you out in this case, especially if you have some nice tracks plus some kind of info (links) redirecting listeners to the album.

Let me preface this with the fact that before I got started writing for libraries I was producing royalty free loop packs for several big companies. I started doing that in 2001. With that said I started to notice my sounds in music on TV and thought to myself hey maybe I should be writing for TV. This is around the time when I discovered a site called Reverbnation. I had uploaded roughly 30-40 songs to RN just to share them with the world but the  nice thing is I was able to import my mailing list from my royalty free loop following and customers. This allowed me to message my fans through Reverbnation which then in turn bumped me to the very top of the charts until one year back in 2009 I was approached by them. Seems I got their attention. They said they were partnering with a company in Hollywood called APM and they were selecting a small amount of chart topping songwriters to get the ball rolling and I happened to be one of them. I was one of 13 artists in the initial announcement. Now this wasn't one of their pay to submit type offers it was a legit connection with APM so of course I agreed. Long story short this got my foot in the door with one of the world's best and oldest (KPM/APM/Universal Production Music) library agents/publishers. I was so STOKED! It took roughly a year to get my first placement and I made $8.00 on my first BMI statement. One of my songs was used in E News which is a celebrity talk show here in the states. Like a Hollywood gossip news show. It wasn't until the 4th quarter 2011 when I broke $100. At this point I realized I'm finally doing it , living my dream, getting music in TV shows. Now 10 years later My BMI statements are 25 pages deep and I'm getting more and more placements in video games, films, and TV. I have roughly 200 songs with APM. That opened a lot of doors for me and now I have my own non-exclusive library (roughly 2000 songs) as well which is with several different publishers including Spirit Music, eONE, Universal, and Epitome Music to name a few.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_ddspep,,,,/r/ProductionMusic/comments/ddspep/first_year_in_library_music_first_placement/f4bb4wn/,public,False,,,,,1571509684.0,r/ProductionMusic,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1354907120.0,1579437357.0,,False,[],

&gt; Quaker City Night Hawks' brand of hard rock n' roll is bred from Texas boogie, Memphis soul and heavy blues. Their music is southern rock right out of '75, played with the fervor of a sermon crackling out of the radio in a '68 Lincoln. They're the whiskey bottle you finished Saturday night and the prayer you said the next morning. Like a country gunshot on a humid night and your first illicit beer, Quaker City Night Hawks are the spirit of rock n' roll. Come shake your hips.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so.

Hi! We are a hard rock/heavy metal band from Italy with influences ranging from Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against The Machine, Black Sabbath, Rush and much more. We released our debut EP  the 29th of May, 2019. It is called 'The Capital' and features the concept of the social pyramid, around which all the songs are centered. Each one of them focuses on one ""level"" of the pyramid, from the top, The Capital, to the bottom which is total alienation. The EP is available on all digital stores! Here are links to all our social pages and to listen to our music on Spotify! Tell me what you think and perhaps consider our songs for a Spotify playlist! Thanks!

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's Rishloo continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool, and Fair to Midland, Rishloo strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of Rishloo. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as Rishloo. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, Rishloo have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation, and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, Rishloo continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada. In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata, and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released December 2014.

&gt;BABYMETAL was formed in 2010 with a theme of 'Kawaii METAL', 
combining J-POP idols and heavy metal. The PV to their first single, 
Doki Doki ‚òÜMorning, was uploaded to Youtube and was soon viewed 
by many overseas viewers expressing shock. The group has started 
to gain notice not only in Japan but also overseas in the North and 
South America, Europe and Asia. The direction the group is going is
to be the only one, rather than number one.

I would hazard a guess that was from Amuse marketing, primarily because the same exact text is used elsewhere. For instance, ReverbNation in July 2012.

&gt;In 2010, BABYMETAL was formed a unit on the theme of ""Kawaii METAL"" (The meaning is mix of J-POP IDOL and HEAVY METAL). The music video of ""DOKI DOKI‚òÜMORNIG"" was published on YouTube, then access from overseas flooded with many comments shocked, and its presence have spread not only in Japan but also to overseas such as North America, South America, Europe and Asia. BABYMETAL is starting to receive attention beyond the idle and beyond Japan, and they are pursuing the road of the only one instead of the number one.

The exact same text is use here, announcing the sellout of Legend I in 2012.

The use of the phrase ""Kawaii Metal"" starts appearing regularly following the release of Headbanger. I'd almost consider it a certainty that the phrase came from Amuse as part of the marketing campaign that accompanied that single.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so.

However, I have never been a paying member of ReverbNation. From my experience with it using it for free in the past, the only use of the site is if you pay for a membership and try to apply to any one of the opportunities they advertise. If you are willing to pay for a membership for a short period of time, who knows, maybe you'll find something. But even in terms of networking, keep in mind, that Reverb seems to be only for musicians. You will only really be able to find the opportunity to network with other musicians on the site, but not just genuine listeners / supporters - people who just want to support your music expecting nothing in return. A lot of these musicians on Reverb will become ""fans"" of yours on the site, hoping you'll ""fan"" them back so they can grow their numbers but that's it. Most likely, they will never actually listen to your music. But again, I have never paid for subscription to get the other perks of the site. Maybe give it a go and see what happens, you never know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**This isn't a challenge that I'm proposing to myself or some way of forcing myself to write Music.**   I write, record and produce Music all the time.  Over the years I've gathered random tracks that I've finished and I'll put them together to make 40-50 minutes worth of Music and I'll release that as an Album.  

But all of these albums were basically just personal mix-tapes that didn't start out with the intent of being put together on an album.  

In 2004 I specifically wrote, recorded and released my first album called The Wasted Creator.  I spent little over 6 months on that album.  But I was also learning recording, mixing, producing and mastering techniques as well.  Needless to say my techniques have improved over the years as has my equipment.  

I've always been very proud of my mix-tape albums but I've also been waiting patiently for the right time to put forth concerted effort into a new full length album written completely from scratch.  Which brings me to my current project.  

Considering that my first album did take 6 months, my time-line might seem a bit far fetched.  I started writing and recording on Tuesday this week (July 16) and by Tuesday of next week I plan on having at minimum 8 songs totaling at least 45 minutes worth of Music.  

I play a Parker Fly Mojo through a Fender Super Champ X2 that is mic'd with an SM57 running into a Focusrite Scarlett recording at 192kHz/24-bit using Reaper for my DAW.  For most of the recordings I plan on having the Super Champ on Channel 1 which bypasses any of the amp modeling so I'll be pulling all my tone from my guitar and my pedals through an all tube amp's clean channel.  

I plan on using Channel 2 for a few things as well.  Specifically for the Super Champ's Amp Modeling of the JazzMaster (#16)  I'll use this for the Parker Fly's Piezo Pre-Amp which emulates the sound of a high end acoustic guitar when plugged into an Acoustic Amp, Bass Cabinet or in this case a high end solid-state amp with as near to a flat-response as possible.  It sounds incredible.

The pedals I'll be using are The Bends by Fender (Compression),  Mirror Image Delay by Fender (Delay), RAT (Overdrive/Distortion), Big Muff (Grunge/Distortion) and a CryBaby 535Q.  

My current chain is Parker-&gt;RAT-&gt;CryBaby-&gt;Bends-&gt;BigMuff(Experimenting with placement on this one)-&gt;MirrorDelay-&gt;SuperChamp

I've gone back and forth with the Compressor being before or after the CryBaby but with the RAT before the Wah it really sounds great having total control over that sound with the compressor right after the Wah.  Plus then I have the Big Muff after the compressor so I can really get some unique tones with this set up.

I'm using the Classic Fender Reverb that's on the Super Champ as well from time to time.

I use Addictive Drums for Drum Programming.  And I use the Novation Bass Station VST for Bass.  I usually record with an actual bass but the tone I'm going for on this album is a bit different than anything I've done before so I'm sticking with the Bass Station which is an excellent virtual instrument.

I've got thousands of hours of producing under my belt so managing each project and finishing the mixes shouldn't be where most of my time will be spent.  And for mastering I use a website called LANDR which automates the Mastering process for me.  

I can even have my DAW (Reaper) automatically upload mixdowns straight to LANDR.  The process takes between 30 minutes and an hour and they'll give you 3 versions to choose from.  Basically: Light Mastering, Medium Mastering, Heavy Mastering    

Which is actually very helpful because I've ended up using each of them in different situations.  Once you pick which version you want they'll automatically upload the final product in whatever format you've chosen to whatever folder you have set up for incoming files.  Lower quality MP3's are free but if you want to get high quality WAV files back you have to pay a monthly subscription.  Which I do because the results are absolutely amazing and they save me hours of work per project. 

So hopefully I can devote what precious little time I do have straight into creativity and performance.  Which usually isn't a problem for me.  Especially if I'm really amp'd up about a project like I am with this one.  

I've already got 3 projects pretty much mapped out with most of the tracks recorded.  The drums are mostly filler at this point and I haven't even started working on vocals yet.  Plus I'm playing around with the idea of combining 2 of them into one song but I'm not sure yet.  But it's been a very encouraging start. 

I've been working towards a certain tonal sound for a very very long time (I think most musicians (especially guitar players) can relate) and with my Parker Fly Mojo and this little 1x10 Super Champ x2 with an SM57,  I've finally found my tone.  And what's even better is that I can capture it just as well in these initial recordings.  I'm so very excited to see how this turns out and I can't wait to hear my new album.

**Sorry for the long post!!!**   I knew I'd end up rambling which is why I started with the TL;DR.  Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my story and like I said at the beginning I would be more than happy to take advice, opinions or even any questions about my set up.

&gt; Biography
In the fall of 2011, James Knoerl and Sam Harchik started the project you are now viewing as ‚ÄúAviations.‚Äù That autumn season was the beginning of an exceedingly hopeful path filled with meeting valued friends, countless learning experiences, and the breaking of today‚Äôs musical trends. 

&gt; Before admitting himself into Berklee College of Music out of high school, James had already been writing songs for a band that he knew he would intend to form. Once on campus, he joined forces with Sam. The two of them had a full album written, and soon they began recording. Shareef was made an addition to the band following his departure from a project of similar genre, and from then on, recording instrumentals for the album continued. The band had no legitimate plans for acquiring a vocalist for their musical venture, however, during the summer of 2012, Adam demoed on tracks and was given the spot. Dave Wolfberg from another Berklee band, Earthstomper, decided to join on as the second guitarist for the band.

&gt; On October 13th, 2012, ‚ÄúA Declaration of Sound,‚Äù the band‚Äôs debut release, was the final product of the story so far. 

&gt; Due to the intensive instrumentals and intricate rhythms constructed for their listeners. Aviations powers your ability to become involved with each song, forcing you to tend to individual parts with exclusive attention, while linking everything to a whole-sound with ease. If your comprehension enjoys a challenge, give them a listen. 

&gt; Stay tuned with their facebook page for updates on everything from their music, to shows, and even hilariously funny homemade videos. Comment on their pages- more than anything, they love hearing from the people who enjoy their music. Read more on Last.fm.

I'd say maybe just stay away from YouTube, that's where copyright sharks are the hungriest.

&amp;#x200B;

Independent artists might care more however, since they rely in good part on word of mouth as a marketing tool. If you're gonna do a scathing, horrible review of a small struggling artist's album then I suggest not doing it at all, not just for copyrights issue but for your own brand as well. Showcase little know artists and their material and you'll build your name as a choice outlet for such artists which means interviews, exclusive content and \**gasp*\* backstage passes. Trash them and you'll be on their sh\*tlist.

I do what I describe as a *Music Appreciation* podcast, where I only play music I want to share my love for. It's undoubtedly smaller than yours in terms of audience, but so far I featured 2 very indie artists whose stuff is only available on Soundcloud and Reverbnation, and one of them asked my input recently for new material he's working on.

&gt; From the beginning, hard rock band, Paralandra, decided to concentrate on creating pure, heartfelt music, no matter how it came out. They have not wavered from this approach, and continue to strive to provide a product that is a sincere and unique expression of themselves, both lyrically and musically. The band started in the summer of 2013 as, Casandra Carson (lead vocal and guitar), decided to create a band to perform the songs she had begun writing. Everything clicked when reunited with Casandra‚Äôs former highschool friend, Nick Gray, who also had been writing and wishing to perform in an original rock band. Within less than 2 months, the newly formed band began playing live and recording. Paralandra‚Äôs first 12-song CD, Rise Up, was released in June of 2014, and reorders were a necessity to keep up with demand from sales at live performances.
Paralandra is known for their high energy while on stage. They have created an intentional and orchestrated show for all viewers to enjoy, not only to listen to, but to watch. Each song, transition, key, tempo, and crowd interaction is carefully thought out and designed to create an entertainment experience that will never be forgotten. They soon began to enjoy more widespread and high profile shows, including opening for Fuel, Hinder, Scott Weiland, Wayland, Art of Dying, Lacey Sturm, TRAPT, and more, as well as playing to local crowds as large as 7,500. They have also been invited to numerous showcases across the country, including playing in David Ivory‚Äôs (multi Grammy winning producer of Halestorm, The Roots, and more) showcase at the Millennium Music Conference in 2015 and SXSW in Austin, Texas in March of 2016. They have been blessed to receive many appreciated accolades in their still fresh musical journey, such as being nominated ‚ÄúBest Original Band‚Äù by the readers of 417 Magazine, ‚ÄúBest Musical Performance‚Äù on the late night talk show, The Mystery Hour, ‚ÄúYear's Best Band Performance‚Äù by Ozarks LIVE! on KOZL, a CBS television network, #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as consistently holding a top-10 spot on the Reverbnation Rock Charts.

My first song was Symphony of destruction. It was easy to play but man that solo was painful for a beginner so I tried again and again and when I thought I nailed it i was wrong. Slayer, overkill, municipal waste I realized I can play fast rhythm earlier.  After a year or so I felt bored sudden out of nowhere. I used to mess with clean tones and I heard my first BB king song suggested by a friend. I realized I cannot play blues the way he is playing although those notes are simple. Man sometimes simple can be hard! I know there's a saying it's the feels can't argue. I started experimenting with low to no gain tones. Joe Satriani became another favorite of mine. Keep watching youtube tutorials and I find this gem E minor the way Joe played. It is such a simple chord but it sounds.. sooooo beautiful. I find out there's a connection between each chords. It's been 4 years I learned from mistakes and I dared to make a lot. Sometimes learning from mistakes even tho it might hurt the ego is good. Industrial Metal was a new journey as well. Mixing electronic beats with pure American downtuned powerchords. I started mixing tracks. I got a Cort X500 as birthday present by girlfriend. It had Floyd Rose Tremolo which is my first guitar with a tremolo. Imagine songs I would be egar to play.. Steve Vai? :D Whispering a prayer. It was a whole new world. Felt like I am playing guitar for the first time again. That's wonderful about this instrument isn't? You never get bored there's almost endless tones, techniques, feels. A whole new journey to be honest. I would be honest I was never meant to be a shredder although I love to hear my favorite guitarists shred. It could be my fingers ain't that long or I am not determined enough. Tabs helped me a lot more than guitar lessons online. Tabs are like manuals.

Soundcloud doesn't help you much to reach crowd if you're starting, neither reverbnation. It's even harder being a solo musician.

&amp;#x200B;

ReverbNation has the ILLUSION of the first steps of success. Now, what I mean by this is that their utilities and aim (at least back in the day when I used it) show promise, they just weren't utilized correctly, such as seeing if your work is ""good enough"" for the masses, such as professional stream / radio, based off of a point system and reviews on overall quality of production. However, more often than not, if that place is even still relevant, the reviewer really doesn't listen and spews some junk at you that likely doesn't apply and maybe give you a good rating. Fans are not fans, generally. ""Fans"" are other musicians pulling off the fan-for-fan concept to boost numbers. Ranking systems in local, state, country, and global is assumed based off recent plays rather than overall, as it isn't hard to make it to #1 local with 20 plays in a week on a given track. Am I saying use RN? Absolutely not. This is a plea to avoid the place. Good intent and idea, but horrific execution and compliance from those involved.  


Soundcloud is a very good start. A lot of big artists still, to this day, use Soundcloud. YouTube could still be a good start, but wouldn't solely rely on it, as it's golden days are said to be over. Whether that has weight or not is another story. Hell, depending on genre, VampireFreaks could score the beginning of a following. Networking is key, so you're going to want to use as many semi-reliable to reliable sources as you can comfortably manage. Link those banks to a Facebook ""Like"" page, and possibly an Instagram (though IG is pretty much just a more visually focused version of FB).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if it is not out of your comfort zone, look into collaboration. Whether it is musically, or intellectually, a lot of positive possibilities come from this. In my free time, back in 2008, I did a remix of one of Nine Inch Nails' songs (couldn't tell you which one it was at this very moment, refer to the warning above), submitted, though didn't place quite high enough to make a remix album, BUT did get some recognition from another group, NUDE! ( Electronica / Breakbeat / Drum n Bass group from Germany). I did two remixes for them and they played them on one of their tours. Not much in the long run, however, at the moment it made the world to me - gave me momentum. Dedicated and humble artists look after dedicated and humble artists. I kid you not, I've watched people exchange ""business cards"" with just a simple url on it at festivals lol. Though it kinda feels desperate at times, petty self-promotion is the first step to major platforms, in my opinion. If the quality is there, and you're 100% serious about this in this very moment, slinging your info and work will eventually lead to just posting an update somewhere, because of your self-promotion, drive, and love for what you do have inspired others to do the promotion for you.

&gt; In August of 2009, Strychnia, a five-piece Death/Thrash metal band, was formed in Dayton, New Jersey. Strychnia‚Äôs broad range of influences have allowed them to dominate the local metal scene with aggressive thrash and crushing death metal grinds. After releasing a few demos, the band finally entered the studio in May 2010 and began recording their debut album, ‚ÄúThe Anatomy of Execution‚Äù with producer Bobby Torres of Fright Box Recordings. Due to financial problems the band never finished their album until May 2011. The band finally released the album on June 14th, 2011. Shortly after the album‚Äôs release, three of Strychnia‚Äôs members left the band. The band entered a hiatus and began planning a comeback. On July 31st, 2012, Strychnia announced their comeback with a newly reformed lineup. The band also announced they are working on a new EP which is scheduled to release in the Fall/Winter of 2012. Although the band has a full lineup planned for recording, they are still searching for a full-time Bassist and Drummer for live shows. Prior to their hiatus, the band had already earned a strong reputation and proved to be one of New Jersey's best Death/Thrash Metal bands on the scene. The band quotes, ""It's not often that you will find new bands that can impact their audience and get them moving without giving in to the mainstream commercialized bullshit. We are one of the bands that strive to make that difference in the music scene. Our unique mixture of influences has given us a sound that has virtually separated us from your generic metal band of the new era"". 

&gt; During their two years of annihilation, Strychnia shared the stage with many national acts and received interest from multiple independent record labels. Strychnia has played alongside bands such as: Exodus, Hate Eternal, Lazarus AD, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.), Warbringer, Waking The Cadaver, Malevolent Creation, Destroyer 666, Revocation, Goatwhore, The Absence, Rumpelstiltskin Grinder, Rose Funeral, EkoTren, Ventana, &amp; Mobile Deathcamp. The band has also played many of the top venues in New Jersey, as well as the Tri-State Area. Including: Starland Ballroom, The Trocadero, Hangar 84, Dingbatz, Crocodile Rock Cafe, Championship Bar &amp; Grill, and more!

&gt; A few months after their album‚Äôs release, Strychnia announced that they would be making their entire album available for free download via their social media pages such as Facebook and ReverbNation, as well as Mediafire. The band quotes, ‚ÄúWe really just want people to hear the hard work we put into this album. We spent 100+ hours in the studio recording, editing, and tweaking these songs and we are dying to hear everyone's opinion‚Ä¶ We are dedicated musicians and nothing is more awesome than hearing how much you guys dig our tunes. Plus we're still a local band, we care mainly about exposure and everyone hearing our music. If we ever wanna break outta the local scene we can't rely on people spending money to hear our music.‚Äù In addition to their debut album‚Äôs release, Strychnia had a ‚ÄúStrychnified Zombie‚Äù T-shirt designed by Cruise of Arterial Designs. At the time, Cruise had designed shirts for bands such as: Suicide Silence, Born of Osiris, Rose Funeral, Veil of Maya, and Chelsea Grin. The ‚ÄúStrychnified Zombie‚Äù shirt is no longer available for purchase, but the band plans on working with a new artist to design a new shirt inspired by artwork related to their upcoming EP.

&gt; The following excerpt was taken from an article/review written about the band, following one of their top performances at Starland Ballroom on January 16th, 2010:
-------------------------------------------------------
When a ""Scream"" band comes along and makes my head swing, it's a RARE occasion. However, other than the mighty ""Cradle of Filth"" never has a ""screamer"" made me want to slam my cranium against a wall in triumph and pure respect more than the band Strychnia!
This band nailed it. With a bass line that could bring a mountain down, guitars that could melt faces off, drums that could shatter a glacier, and a vocalist who hit every throat gurgling note with precision and tenacity in such a way that it would be worthy as a war ensemble.
I couldn't have been more impressed by this bands abilities. The fact that they were so young was what impressed me the most. I don't think any of them were over 20. It made an older metal maniac like me happy to know there are kids out there who still want to carry the torch of metal into the depths for years to come.

&gt; REVOLUTION
The perfect balance of metal, punk, and grind from the old school to the new. This is the essence of the sound of REVOLUTION. It represents our feelings and also help us describe the sound. But most important of all, it represents the sound of our city, Miami, Florida. 
From the beginning, we wanted to mix metal, punk and grind in ways that has not been done before. Trying to bring the Miami Scene to burst has been our priority since day one.‚ÄùAs Heavy As A Sledgehammer‚Äù is how the sound was described by some of our listeners.
Hailing from the ashes of different local bands, Gery, Joel and Mr. Jhon started to jam in a regular basis. Gery played drums and sung most of the sessions. A song called REVOLUTION came out in this first set of songs. We called an old friend ‚ÄòAbe‚Äô to fill in drums, he helped us tight the songs up getting us ready to play. Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt like the direction the band was taking and decided to leave the band. Danny jumped in the drum set, and we were out playing open mics by mid 2007. It was good times, we will call the band a different name at every show.After a few shows, we decided to call the band like the first song we composed. REVOLUTION was born, but still didn‚Äôt have a steady drummer. Finally, Joel‚Äôs friend refers them to Kevin. He auditioned and within the first minute of the audition. We all knew we had found the fourth member of REVOLUTION. The first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù REVOLUTION show was February 28th, 2008, at club Drakkes. It was on! We played over two hundred shows in a two year period. We won the ‚ÄúBEST SHOW‚Äù at the STATUS-QUO AWARD CEREMONY 2008 produced by DJ OSKI and QUEEN OF THE SCENE. We stayed ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù local band at the REVERBNATION CHARTS for over two years. We had live broadcasts from ‚ÄúMEZZ TV‚Äù and ‚ÄúTHE TALENT FARM‚Äù. The song ‚ÄúHOPELESS‚Äù was featured in TLP RADIO in Tampa Florida, in the Monday Metal Show BRUTAL BACKHAND. REVOLUTION was the ‚Äúfeatured band‚Äù at the Peruvian radio station ‚ÄúMAXIMO VOLUMEN‚Äù having the songs ‚ÄúNever Again‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath In Paradise‚Äù in heavy rotation. The song ‚ÄúNever Again‚Äù is featured in the 2009 Kryptonite Allstars Compilation CD. We record our first Ep. ‚ÄúLIVE TO FIGHT‚Äù. The cover art is created by extremely talented local artist N.F.Romero. It was mixed and mastered by multi instrumentalist Mick Kenney (ANAAL NATHRAKH, NAPALM DEATH, DELIVERANCE). It is on sale in AMAZON MP3, ITUNES STORE, and ANDROID STORE. The songs from the first Ep appeared in several compilations (KRYPTONITE ALLSTARS II and III, COLOSSAL MUSIC FESTIVAL ALLSTARS, LARGOPALOOZA, SPRINGBREAK BASH 2010).By June of 2010, Mr. Jhon decided to abandon the band for personal reasons. We stayed still for a couple of months looking for a replacement. Finally, Robbie D. calls Gery and tells him that he needs to audition him. That no one else is gonna call, because he has grabbed all the adds from the store. He fitted perfectly as a rhythm guitar. Now, we were in the search for a lead guitar. We had to settle with a guy named Raul, because we had shows lined up. REVOLUTION was featured in THE METAL DELI RADIOSHOW from Chicago. Kevin and Raul part ways from REVOLUTION, putting us in stand by one more time. Robbie decides to bring his old bandmates from THE CHAOS LEGION to fill in the vacant spots. Jack Sinister join us in guitar and Choupah Brootality on drums. REVOLUTION has played in Miami‚Äôs most prominent venues (TOBACCO ROAD, CHURCHILLS, FLAVOUR, DRAKES, STUDIO A, ROCKSHOP, VINYL &amp; KAY, JAZZID, EVE, etc) We have also entered the Broward circuit playing at their most important venues ( AREA 7, PULP LIVE, MUGSHOTS, OMALLEYS, VENOM ROCK BAR). But we have also gone south to Key Largo @ PONTUNES. We are getting ready for recording, and Robbie decides to leave the band for family reasons. Shortly after, he is replaced by talented Mars Clemente. Having his first show two days after he joined the band. REVOLUTION has been featured in articles in the most important written media in Miami ( The MIAMI HERALD, MIAMI NEW TIMES, ARISTOCATS, MIAMI LIFE MAGAZINE, MIAMI SNAPSHOTS). 
We use STEVE CLAYTON picks and accesories. REVOLUTION uses OBSCENITEASE gear in our performances. REVOLUTION is trying to keep live music alive!!
Now you started the REVOLUTION!!!!

&gt; Delaware has never been known for bringing out young bands trying to gain recognition, but until now none have broken out as well as Dover‚Äôs Awake At Last. Falling on the more progressive side of the rock world, the four-piece draws influence from bands like The Used and rock bands like Saosin. Awake At Last has found an aggressive blend of radio rock and pop melodies that create a whirlwind of emotion and with a live energy that matches the high energy of their recordings, AAL aims to travel the world playing unforgettable shows and captivate their fans.

&gt; Formed in 2011, Awake At Last -- featuring vocalist Vincent Torres, guitarist Eric Blackway, bassist Tyler Greene, and drummer Bryan Mills ‚Äì continues to bring a fresh sound to the Delaware music scene. Vincent Torres comments, ‚ÄúSome kids will only listen to a specific genre or a specific band, but for the most part the public just likes good live music and can make the best of whatever situation.‚Äù Being a band with a solid sound has helped boost AAL‚Äôs overall recognition and has ranked them as Dover‚Äôs number one rock group on Reverbnation charts. ‚ÄúWe've played some local shows for our local crowd where the venue is packed wall to wall and it's amazing. It all about making connections with our fans‚Äù explains guitarist Eric Blackway. Since the bands formation they have been on four east coast tours, one nationwide tour, and have played such festivals as SXSW, Heart of Texas Rock Fest, and Launch Music Festival, joining the stage with acts including Life On Repeat (Equal Vision Records), Us From Outside (Tragic Hero Records), and Life As A Ghost (Eulogy Records).

&gt; Biography
In the fall of 2011, James Knoerl and Sam Harchik started the project you are now viewing as ‚ÄúAviations.‚Äù That autumn season was the beginning of an exceedingly hopeful path filled with meeting valued friends, countless learning experiences, and the breaking of today‚Äôs musical trends. 

&gt; Before admitting himself into Berklee College of Music out of high school, James had already been writing songs for a band that he knew he would intend to form. Once on campus, he joined forces with Sam. The two of them had a full album written, and soon they began recording. Shareef was made an addition to the band following his departure from a project of similar genre, and from then on, recording instrumentals for the album continued. The band had no legitimate plans for acquiring a vocalist for their musical venture, however, during the summer of 2012, Adam demoed on tracks and was given the spot. Dave Wolfberg from another Berklee band, Earthstomper, decided to join on as the second guitarist for the band.

&gt; On October 13th, 2012, ‚ÄúA Declaration of Sound,‚Äù the band‚Äôs debut release, was the final product of the story so far. 

&gt; Due to the intensive instrumentals and intricate rhythms constructed for their listeners. Aviations powers your ability to become involved with each song, forcing you to tend to individual parts with exclusive attention, while linking everything to a whole-sound with ease. If your comprehension enjoys a challenge, give them a listen. 

&gt; Stay tuned with their facebook page for updates on everything from their music, to shows, and even hilariously funny homemade videos. Comment on their pages- more than anything, they love hearing from the people who enjoy their music. Read more on Last.fm.

And that's fine, sometimes ReverbNation's format on mobile is wonky, but if you have time and want to immerse yourself in the experience fully, the tracklist is as follows: 

1. Alpha 2. Passage 3. Sleepless 4. Brief App. 5. Waking Reverie 6. Arrival 7. Melatonin 8. Within the Medium 9. Curiosity 10. Oneiroi

And yes, part 2 is all acoustic as well. We're trying to incorporate a full-band, as these songs are quite big in scope.

Getting some Maudlin of the Well and An Endless Sporadic vibes from Curiosity which is awesome.  


Already some Haken vibes in the chord progression at and before 3:00 of Oneiroi too. Loving the blend of acoustic guitars and pianos in the following sections. Really good stuff.

Medium: Harley Benton Telecaster, tc electronic DITTO looper pedal, CASIO keyboard, VOX VT50 amp (also used for mixing), finally recorded (from the amp) via a low-quality Chinese Android smartphone and tweaked a bit with Audacity software.

Here's what I'd like to know... **WTF would you call this as a 'genre'?** I write a lot of stuff like this and never know how to classify it when sharing to Soundcloud, ReverbNation, etc. Also, when I make these little demos I typically capture the idea with a simple V1, V2, Chorus, V3, V4, Chorus(x2), Out... so **I am open to ideas for how to develop the song(s) further** \-- could be anything from structure (with bridge, of course) to additional instruments or (god help me, I can't believe I'm saying this as someone who doesn't really like electronic music) electronic background ambience.

CDBaby - I've had good luck with them in the past but the CSR was enough to turn me completely away this time. I put in the release over a week ago so theoretically, it should be running now.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ Genre: Extreme Metal

&gt; ‚Ä¢ Hometown: Hamburg

&gt; ""Apnoe‚Äú ‚Äì condition, restriction, illness. When it is getting hard to breathe, sometimes you need to free yourself and break bridges in order to continue.

&gt; TODTGELICHTER finally broke with their Black Metal past after a demo (2003, self-released) and two albums (‚ÄúWas Bleibt‚Ä¶‚Äù 2005, ‚ÄúSchemen‚Äù 2007 on Folter Rec.) to embrace a new future: ‚ÄúAngst‚Äù (out 2010 on Code666/Aural Music, dist. Soulfood) was an Avantgarde/Progressive/Post-Metal monster which earned them overwhelming press response, an enthusiastic fanbase and several album-of‚Äìthe-month awards. The following year was followed by many successful live appearances; not only were they asked by PRIMORDIAL to support them for two exclusive release-gigs, they also played at the RAGNAR√ñK Festival, the METALFEST Dessau, the extended HEIDENFEST Tour 2011 in front of several thousand attendants and the WAVE GOTIK TREFFEN 2012 plus being featured on German television channel Sat1.

&gt; Another big change is due with ‚ÄúApnoe‚Äù. Vocalist/bass guitar player Nils left, new members Tobias and Chris joined to take part in shaping what TODTGELICHTER is all about in 2013: While still somewhat rooted in Metal, the focus nowadays lies on their distinctive guitar melodies, the vocal duets between female lead Marta and male lead Tobias, more mature songwriting and a top-notch production by Eike Freese (who has worked with e.g. GAMMA RAY, OOMPH!, EISBRECHER, Christina St√ºrmer a.m.m.). ""Apnoe"" is nothing less than the strongest material the band has written so far!

&gt; Current Line-up:
‚Ä¢ Marta: All screams &amp; vocals
‚Ä¢ Frederic: guitars, backing vocals
‚Ä¢ Floris: guitars
‚Ä¢ Guntram: bass
‚Ä¢ Tentakel P.: drums, synths

&gt; - 2003 - Fluch/Sog In Den Wahnsinn (demo)
- 2005 - Was bleibt... (compilation)
- 2007 - Schemen (full-length)
- 2010 - Angst (full-length)
- 2013 - Apnoe (full-length)

&gt; Quaker City Night Hawks' brand of hard rock n' roll is bred from Texas boogie, Memphis soul and heavy blues. Their music is southern rock right out of '75, played with the fervor of a sermon crackling out of the radio in a '68 Lincoln. They're the whiskey bottle you finished Saturday night and the prayer you said the next morning. Like a country gunshot on a humid night and your first illicit beer, Quaker City Night Hawks are the spirit of rock n' roll. Come shake your hips.

Their music is southern rock right out of '75, played with the fervor of a sermon crackling out of the radio in a '68 Lincoln. They're the whiskey bottle you finished Saturday night and the prayer you said the next morning. Like a country gunshot on a humid night and your first illicit beer, Quaker City Night Hawks are the spirit of rock n' roll. Come shake your hips.

&gt; Tytus is an up-and-coming singer/songwriter from Greenville, SC. As a solo artist at the moment, he is working his way to an Indie label and eventually to obtaining more band members and establishing a massive fan base. Working hard to start his career, Tytus is open for any chance he can get to play a live show. He is willing and able to play for exposure. Although he has a variety of songs up his sleeve, the heart of the music comes from his Christian faith. While some songs are about experiences in life, others just break it back down to the basics and give thanks to God for the journeys of life. Tytus music is not just surface-deep. He has a heart for helping others and a dream to do so through his talents and music. If you would like to contact Tytus or learn more, just simply send a message through Reverbnation, Facebook, or even email.

&gt; With a line up that includes musicians from bands as varied as URGEHAL, PANTHEON I, UNTIME, MELCH, HALLUCINATIONS, POWERSWORD and SARKOM, TROLLFEST‚Äôs members bring with them not only a wealth of experience and the skill to make use of instruments like the accordion, the banjo and the saxophone, but also a sense of diversity that allows the band to create a sound that is distinctly its own.  Whilst ‚ÄúTrue Norwegian Balkan Metal‚Äù goes some way towards describing the TROLLFEST sound - hinting as it does at the extreme end of metal, with a good pinch of local traditional folk - it doesn‚Äôt really go the whole way towards capturing the sense of fun and sheer exuberance with which the band tackles everything it does, whether it involves playing in the studio or performing live.  

&gt; Formed in 2004, in Oslo, Norway, when a bunch of musicians became bored with the selection of party music that was available to them, and, helped along by the consumption of large quantities of alcohol, the soon-to-be members of TrollfesT decided to take matters into their own hands. One website and six songs later, a German label, which at the time was called Solistium, recognised the potential in the madness and got in touch. With the immortal words ‚Äúwhat the heck, let‚Äôs give it a go‚Äù TrollfesT agreed to a deal and started writing new material.  By 2005 ‚ÄúWillkommen Folk tell Drekka Fest!!‚Äù hit the streets.  And life as we know it was never the same again. 

&gt; Containing a selection of sounds and comments, many of which you would not necessarily come across if you only frequented polite parties, ‚ÄúWillkommen‚Ä¶‚Äù displayed some unique qualities that caught people‚Äôs attention and consequently sold rather a lot of copies, so a deal for a second album was signed and in 2006 the story of Brakebein the Troll was released. ‚ÄúBrakebein‚Äù (not a bad choice for a title really given its subject matter), appeared in two versions - one that included a cartoon illustrating Brakebein‚Äôs voyage, and the other that included the lyrics.  

&gt; During the first years, TrollfesT never actually played live, but nevertheless the two albums succeeded in making the band a sought after addition to festivals, and the first foray beyond the planning stage occurred in 2007 as one of the headlining bands at the Ninth Barther Metal Open Air Festival.  TrollfesT then went on to headline and play various festivals and concerts around Europe during 2007/08 including the Ragnar√∂k and Riedfest festivals.

&gt; January 2009 saw the release of TrollfesT‚Äôs third studio album ‚ÄúVillanden‚Äù.  A much-anticipated underground album according to feedback from the fans, ‚ÄúVillanden‚Äù was quickly acknowledged as one of the craziest albums to have been released in a very long time, mixing, as it did, European Balkan music with extreme metal, and spread rapidly through the viral networks like YouTube, MySpace and Facebook.   

&gt; 2011 saw TrollfesT sign with NoiseArt Records for the release of the new album ‚ÄúEn Kvest For Den Hellige Gral‚Äù and with Rock The Nation for world-wide booking. Tours and festival appearancs quickly followed demonstrting that as a live force TrollfesT is hard to beat. 2012 will see the release of ‚ÄùBrumlebassen‚Äù, the band‚Äôs fifth full-length album, and extensive tours have already been set. 
 
So how would anyone, in their right mind, or otherwise, dare to define TrollfesT?  The closest you would come is probably True Norwegian Balkan Metal, but even then you would need to include influences from lots more genres.  The best way to put it is that this band is all about alcohol, joy and music, three subjects that draw in fans from all ages and genres, eager to listen to TrollfesT‚Äôs records and witness the exuberant and skilled live performances.

&gt; THE MAYAN FACTOR - Baltimore, Maryland
Progressive Rock/Alternative Rock
Facebook, ReverbNation
One word to describe The Mayan Factor is haunting. A listen to any song and you will never forget it. To hear either their melodies or Ray's lyrics is to be renewed. Together they blend into an irresistible force of inspirational creativity. Bridging the abyss of unreal to real, the spiritually dead to the vital, these guys are genuine, their warmth contrasting with the vapid corporate chill of modern culture. Living samplers, each man engulfs a smorgasbord of musical styles but they never tack anything on because they can do it. Their music wells from the wellspring of their souls. The old medicine is dead and with it spring. The last tricks have been tried, the last tapestry of their lies woven. The system is corrupt. The system is bankrupt. We await the wall to fall. Turn your ears to the new dispensation. Turn your hearts from the grave.Tune your hearts to the heart of The Mayan Factor...

&gt; The Mayan Factor have an ethnic sound, using atmospheric percussion (kongas and drums), acoustic guitars, various keyboard samples and tribal bass to an melodic, intense effect. The Mayan Factor could equally be called progressive rock as they could be lumped into the space rock category, one thing setting them apart from most artists in these genres is that the vocalist raps on occasion. Don't let this deter you, because it's an altogether interesting and one of a kind experience. Formed in 2002, they have released two full-length albums, ""In Lake 'ch"" (2003) and ""44"" (2005). With the return of Dan Angermaier on drums, and Johnny Burke replacing Brian Scott on guitar, The Mayan Factor was moving forward with a 3rd album that they hoped to release in 2011. However, the singer Ray Schuler died on February 8th 2011  due to a heroin overdose, which put the band on indefinite hiatus.

&gt; NOW, the 3rd  album by The Mayan Factor is available. The album is called Yesterday's Son. Originally these 7 songs started off as demo's, but after Ray's passing, the band went back in and re-recorded the instrumental tracks behind Ray's vocals and guitar. With the help of Frank Marchand as engineer and producer, they have created an emotional roller coaster that serves as a beautiful final offering to themselves and the fans. Breathe it in - Yesterday's Son - and all of The Mayan Factor's music available at cdbaby,  iTunes and many other digital outlets.

I have been in multiple bands in my life and know what it's like to try to get noticed and paid for my work.  We wanted to create an opportunity for bands and artists, one that I would have really liked to have when I was in a small band.  Read into it what you want, but we are trying to do a good thing, I understand that we aren't a huge game company yet and we are asking people to trust us.  

That being said, the submission process is quick, and if we pick your song there isn't a whole lot that bands need to provide.  It's a pretty painless competition.  I have made reverbnation pages, bandcamp pages, put music up on spotify and every bit helps but it's a lot of work.  It's not exactly lucrative being a small band.  Exposure does matter and it helps you get fans and more opportunities.   We are trying to offer both financial compensation and exposure, and we want to start the submission process early while we figure out the compensation details. Bands will have the option not to participate if they aren't happy with the compensation.

I have used FL Studio for the past 15+/- years for making my beats. I've done a lot of shows in WI and MN early in my career and haven't done much else in the last 5 or 6 years other than make beats and record. A couple months ago, i downloaded the windows update, my computer gave me the black screen of death and i had to reformat.... after another update, same thing a couple weeks later. i lost all my sound files, samples, and recordings on my computer from the previous few years. decided to download FL Studio 20 for $200 because i already know how to use it and was missing my alone time making beats. this is one of many i've come up with in the last couple weeks.

if you scroll through my reverbnation page you'll see many of my old songs and beats from years ago but this one is fresh, from the last week (as well as the other top two on the songlist). 

please let me know what you think. i'll definitely leave some feedback for others in the next few days as i plan on making more myself and want to help out other Fruity Loopers out there like me!",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_a4m3us,,,,/r/FL_Studio/comments/a4m3us/post_your_music_here_feedback_thread_december_2018/ecsgnru/,public,,,,,,1546069321.0,r/FL_Studio,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1475028463.0,1548216043.0,,,,

&gt; Biography
In the fall of 2011, James Knoerl and Sam Harchik started the project you are now viewing as ‚ÄúAviations.‚Äù That autumn season was the beginning of an exceedingly hopeful path filled with meeting valued friends, countless learning experiences, and the breaking of today‚Äôs musical trends. 

&gt; Before admitting himself into Berklee College of Music out of high school, James had already been writing songs for a band that he knew he would intend to form. Once on campus, he joined forces with Sam. The two of them had a full album written, and soon they began recording. Shareef was made an addition to the band following his departure from a project of similar genre, and from then on, recording instrumentals for the album continued. The band had no legitimate plans for acquiring a vocalist for their musical venture, however, during the summer of 2012, Adam demoed on tracks and was given the spot. Dave Wolfberg from another Berklee band, Earthstomper, decided to join on as the second guitarist for the band.

&gt; On October 13th, 2012, ‚ÄúA Declaration of Sound,‚Äù the band‚Äôs debut release, was the final product of the story so far. 

&gt; Due to the intensive instrumentals and intricate rhythms constructed for their listeners. Aviations powers your ability to become involved with each song, forcing you to tend to individual parts with exclusive attention, while linking everything to a whole-sound with ease. If your comprehension enjoys a challenge, give them a listen. 

&gt; Stay tuned with their facebook page for updates on everything from their music, to shows, and even hilariously funny homemade videos. Comment on their pages- more than anything, they love hearing from the people who enjoy their music. Read more on Last.fm.

The time wasters will always amount to more than positive outcomes but you gotta just keep doing you.

&gt; Biography
In the fall of 2011, James Knoerl and Sam Harchik started the project you are now viewing as ‚ÄúAviations.‚Äù That autumn season was the beginning of an exceedingly hopeful path filled with meeting valued friends, countless learning experiences, and the breaking of today‚Äôs musical trends. 

&gt; Before admitting himself into Berklee College of Music out of high school, James had already been writing songs for a band that he knew he would intend to form. Once on campus, he joined forces with Sam. The two of them had a full album written, and soon they began recording. Shareef was made an addition to the band following his departure from a project of similar genre, and from then on, recording instrumentals for the album continued. The band had no legitimate plans for acquiring a vocalist for their musical venture, however, during the summer of 2012, Adam demoed on tracks and was given the spot. Dave Wolfberg from another Berklee band, Earthstomper, decided to join on as the second guitarist for the band.

&gt; On October 13th, 2012, ‚ÄúA Declaration of Sound,‚Äù the band‚Äôs debut release, was the final product of the story so far.

I hope it works out for you, but the problem with this type of site is that it implies listeners, in the masses, are just going out there and looking for new music without any kind of curation. It's just not the case.

This is why places like ReverbNation just simply don't work to generate new fans, and get filled with thousands of other musicians who just upvote and like stuff (same on twitter or instagram or anywhere) so that other people will come and check out their stuff, it's inauthentic - it becomes spammy because everyone is just liking and commenting so people will come and check their music out, but why ?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there aren't people looking to seek out new music, but consider a site like ""Short of the Week"", which showcases new short films, especially curated by the website. If it pushed any and every submission to the front page the site would go down quickly - the average short film sucks, really badly (hence why most non film people don't watch short films) -  but it attracts new, non-filmmaking audience members because they know that it has built a reputation for being a good guide to what is new and cool - much like what a good spotify playlist might do.

These non curated sites have popped up over and over for so many years now, and they always burn because they just get filled with mediocre stuff and eventually people stop coming back. The kind of people seeking out a site like this, ie somewhere to promote their music, are most likely early in their development / inexperienced / whatever so most of the stuff you get will be just medicore. Anyone with really cool stuff on their hands will value its importance and try and get it out to blogs, etc.

Just some thoughts, honestly I do really appreciate the sentiment, but without some kind of curated aspect I feel like it's not really going to promote anyone in the way you want it to.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_9r1zvs,,,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/9r1zvs/you_have_incredible_songs_for_the_world_to_hear/e8e0zq3/,public,,,,,,1540417957.0,r/WeAreTheMusicMakers,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1517730990.0,1541425892.0,,,,

(e.g. ""here's a SoundCloud link - would you call this World Fusion?"" and then someone sends back a ReverbNation link and so on? Seems to me that could get a little chaotic, especially if people are using all different platforms.
Or do you mean you'd prefer to have us talk about the music without actually listening to it? This I would find very frustrating, because, for instance, I can use the word ""Celtic"" and you'll think of one thing and I'll think of something completely different. 
Personally, the way I use playlists is not as a source for passive listening (I don't even have the right gear for that, since I don't own a cell phone or good computer speakers.) I use Spotify as a way to FIND and SAMPLE new music, for pleasure and as research for my band. Some of the music is fascinating but I wouldn't want to buy their CD. So I love Spotify for the fact that I can find a bunch of really obscure or deep-niche music and have it at my fingertips in an instant. I love checking out other peoples' playlists in my same genre, because I am astonished at the differences and I always find something I never knew about.
I think it would be great for the people who are seeking new World Music and/or confused about the genre (which appears to be a lot of people on Reddit) to hear a bunch of good examples to facilitate such a discussion.
I also like to give any musicians in the group an opportunity to add music to my playlist (because a lot of them are desperate for such an opportunity), and in my experience most of them don't know the proper etiquette (just like with your group), and even with listeners a lot of them (at least in my genre) don't know how to save a playlist so they can find it again later. It did occur to me that instead of inviting them to ""heart"" my playlist, I could refer them to two links - one written by someone else about Spotify submission etiquette, and one written by someone else about how to save playlists. Then it would be unobtrusive and maybe not seem like spamming?
And, of course, I'd love to have people send links for any World Fusion playlists they have made as well. (But only on Spotify for me, because that's the only service I use right now.)
I am hoping the conversation would draw a lot more interest toward fusion that isn't as commonly associated with the term ""World Music"" (which often just makes people think of reggae, African, or straight Latin dance music). And, for instance, Celtic Woman won a Grammy for being ""World Music"" and I found that pretty interesting, since their genre is really orchestral Celtic. 
I think this could be a big, fun topic of conversation, but without an easy source for links (and to me playlists are the easiest) I think it would be cumbersome and confusing.
May I try rewriting another Post, or are you still opposed even after reading this? I'll defer to your judgement for this group...

I think the biggest thing you need to ask yourself when considering reverbnation is what you are using it for. If you are going to keep it updated and use it as an EPK - alright - it might be a good thing to shre when you are trying to get your band's tunes and bio in one place - but its not the industry standard around here for gauging your social media reach, which is increasingly important.

1. You mentioned you were playing once a month: Don't exceed this in the same market. People who came to your show last Saturday aren't likely to come out the following week and venues typically hate it when you are making your fans choose between close together shows in the same city. Other cities that are more than 45 min-1 hour away are probably ok. For our scene (Seattle) most people observe the 30/30 rules (30 miles or 30 days). In the end you'll have a better show if you let anticipation grow a little - especially with your friends and family.  

2. Be super choosy about your shows. Don't just accept whatever because you feel you NEED to play. Pick the bills with the best drawing bands and the venues that people love to go to. This goes back to Chickpea97612's point: the more friends you start making, the better your chances are of getting on these better bills. Every show should be a step up from your last in terms of bill quality or venue quality until you reach a minimum reasonable standard for what you are looking for in a show. Don't waste your time with Wednesday night gigs at crappy bars. Start writing emails to venues and bands politely asking if there is an opening slot on a decent weekend bill. One will come. Oh and NEVER PAY TO PLAY!  

3. Be super choosy about venues.  
a) target venues who feature music, not football games  
b) target SMALLER venues with great sound systems and are renowned for good shows - better to have apacked smaller place than a half full larger place.  
c) Work those relationships: Meet people. Join music FB groups in your area. Ask for contact info for places you want to play and ask for tips on booking certain places. Once you ARE booked with a place, don't over promise, be gracious, polite, thank the booker, maker sure your COMMUNICATION is ON POINT, and tip your sound guys, thank the bar tenders, offer to help the other bands load in, ask the staff if there is anything you can help with, etc - make that place say to themselves ""Damn, those obstructionist dudes were rad!"" They'll book you again.  

4. Know your value. In our scene, bands are paid comparatively lower than other scenes. I could go on and on about why this is, but that isn't important right this second. Don't demand more than you are worth in your scene.  

5. Don't be that band that complains about lineup. Be willing to open or close. Bigger bands are looking for support and in exchange for their crowd, you are likely going to be asked to play a less-than-desirable slot.Helping out in this way will keep you on their mind for next time.  

6. ACTUALLY WATCH THE OTHER BANDS, give them feedback, and make sure they see your face in the crowd. Mos tof us musicians have at least one narcissistic bone in our body. We like compliments. Be genuine, only say if you mean it, but if there is a bigger band you love and want to play with, watch their set and give them some feedback and let them know you'd love to support a bill some time! GIVE THEM SOMETHING - a business card, CD with your contact, etc - tangible things will win the day.  

7. Be patient. BE PATIENT. \*\*\*BE PATIENT\*\*\*. Hustle like hell but understand this is a long game. It takes YEARS to build a good following. Focus on quality in all you do over quantity and the fans will come. Better shows and better recordings. They are both worth the wait, I promise.  

8. Use social media and use it correctly. Make sure you have a solid FB, Twitter, and Instagram. Get your stuff on a digital distribution platform like tunecore, CDbaby, etc so your stuff gets on Spotify, Apple music, etc. Post on all platforms regularly. Engage with other bands in your scene and invite your friends. Slowly the likes, plays, follows, etc will trickle in. On this note also limit the number of social media platforms you use and concentrate your efforts on a few instead of many. We keep these ones:  
a) Facebook - our main jam really  
b) Twitter  
c) Instagram  
d) an actual website that we use to direct google searchers to other things  
e) youtube  
f) bandcamp - mostly for merch sales  
e) EMAIL LIST!!! this is old school but it works\*\*\*\*Notice, reverbnation is not on this list because its really not a thing, not in our scene at least\*\*\*\*\* itstime for it to die

9) Stay away from online scams that claims to get you more likes, or plays, or follows, etc. Platforms can detect them and might boot you. Venues and promoters can see if your engagement actually matches the number of likes you have, and it ends up being money wasted because when you go to play that show and the venue is expecting a huge turnout based on your socials and it doesn't happen, they aren't going to invite you back.

10) Make sure you have a merch booth at your shows, even if you don't have much to sell. This is the place where folks are going to come and talk to you? Don't have CDs because who uses CDs right? Bullshit. Burn some and do art with the sharpie and hand them out for free if you can. Send them home with something! Also at this book - ask people right there (if they dig you) if they can follow your social accounts. Ask for it, or better yet,make a nice sign exchanging a free sticker and CD for it or something like that.

(Make sure these all have links to each other and connect v)
1. Website
2. Social media (fb, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
3. YouTube channel
4. Reverbnation

5. Contact all music reviewers bloggers you can find and are willing to feature you on social media. Then do that just via web. You'll maybe only get a few, but that one could be worth it and hook you up! 
6. Local radio stations aren't hard to get on if you're just adamant about getting in touch. Just keep calling.

7. Make sure you are out and playing shows and shout your name at beginng middle and end.
8. Bring your guitar (or whatever you do) everywhere and ask if they'll let you play. Or just sit on the street haha, someone will start talking to you (one more fan!)
9. Get business cards with all the above info to give to above ppl!
10. Karaoke nights are great if you sing.. do your best song and tell everyone who loved it about your music.

11. Press releases, same thing with contacting ppl, one might get you somewhere.
12. Contact new music blogs and ask them to listen and possibly feature.
13. Make cool stickers, tshirts, or art to go along with music for the hipsters out there!
14. Also try making friends with someone that does good video, (we got lucky there) ppl love videos!

&gt; The Story:

&gt; Everything about A Primitive Evolution boils down to instinct. From their roots in Toronto‚Äôs cult rock scene to their unrivaled, uninhibited stage show, this band takes hard rock and grunge and pumps groove and sex back into it.  Encapsulating the best of horror and romance, A Primitive Evolution have just released their debut album A.P.E. containing 11 tracks of drippy rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll.

&gt; Their self-produced debut video for ‚ÄúDeath on Wheels‚Äù solidified the band and captured their enigmatic stage presence alongside Frankenstein cheerleaders as part of the 2007 L‚ÄôOreal Fashion Week. Voiced by the late, Martin Streek,a highly respected Toronto DJ, the video caught the attention of the vampire musical movie Suck. The production crew of the film were inspired by the performance setup of the video and wanted to use it in the movie. Iggy Pop made a cameo in the Playdead Mansion as the recording engineer for the fictional band, showcasing A Primitive Evolution‚Äôs jam space and home in the cult landmark.

&gt; Formed in the fall of 2007 out of the ashes of Toronto band Lye, vocalist Brett Carruthers and bassist Steph Seki began jamming with Playdead Cult owner and drummer Stu Dead. They have spent the last 3 years working on building their sound, image, fan base as well as producing their own music videos for the debut album ""A.P.E."" released worldwide on iTunes and via their website in early 2010. Recently they have added a new guitarist, Scott Carruthers who helped them to win the first round of the Hard Rock Cafe Battle of the Bands in February 2011 proving himself to be the perfect addition to the group. Since their inception they have performed as part of the Queen Street Fire fundraiser alongside Billy Talent and the Creepshow. What initiated as fun turned into an organic drive to create something fresh ‚Äì something with its own experimental ideas. In 2009 the group put their live act networking skills to the test and founded a new music festival VIVA LOS MUERTOS (2009 line-up featuring The Birthday Massacre). The festival had an overwhelmingly good response and the group plans to do it again in 2010, hoping to further secure the creation and maintenance of a dynamic death rock scene in Toronto.

&gt; ‚ÄúCreation is evolution‚Äù Carruthers says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I figure we were trying to say with A Primitive Evolution. As evolved as we think we are as humans or animals, we are very much in the beginning of the evolution of mankind. We have so much to learn and yet so much has changed in the last hundred years; we have a long way to go as a species. We wanted our band to reflect that too, to just go off of what we feel, do it out of instinct and evolve naturally. Have some fun existing on this planet.‚Äù

&gt; Produced by Carruthers and Matthew Von Wagner, who has produced U.S.S. and Alpha Galates as well as worked alongside Joe Barresi and Bob Ludwig, A.P.E. is grounded on a few common themes. ‚ÄúDeath on Wheels‚Äù draws inspiration from classic grindhouse horror films, while others like ‚ÄúDead End‚Äù are thinly veiled love songs. ‚ÄúWar B.‚Äù explores political undertones and the Western view of war. ‚ÄúBeyond True‚Äù and ‚ÄúStill Waiting‚Äù draw influences of Radiohead and U2 with an amped up feel uniting the main themes of the album and capturing the romanticism of human interaction. Prepare yourself for a band that is as primal as they are passionate, as convicting as they are creative, and as solid as they are sinister. As CHARTattack stated, ""If you're not from Toronto or you don't know what I'm talking about, I feel sorry for you, because A Primitive Evolution are a rock 'n' roll wet dream and they're sexy as f#&amp;k.""

The production crew of the film were inspired by the performance setup of the video and wanted to use it in the movie. Iggy Pop made a cameo in the Playdead Mansion as the recording engineer for the fictional band, showcasing A Primitive Evolution‚Äôs jam space and home in the cult landmark.

&gt; Formed in the fall of 2007 out of the ashes of Toronto band Lye, vocalist Brett Carruthers and bassist Steph Seki began jamming with Playdead Cult owner and drummer Stu Dead. They have spent the last 3 years working on building their sound, image, fan base as well as producing their own music videos for the debut album ""A.P.E."" released worldwide on iTunes and via their website in early 2010. Recently they have added a new guitarist, Scott Carruthers who helped them to win the first round of the Hard Rock Cafe Battle of the Bands in February 2011 proving himself to be the perfect addition to the group. Since their inception they have performed as part of the Queen Street Fire fundraiser alongside Billy Talent and the Creepshow. What initiated as fun turned into an organic drive to create something fresh ‚Äì something with its own experimental ideas. In 2009 the group put their live act networking skills to the test and founded a new music festival VIVA LOS MUERTOS (2009 line-up featuring The Birthday Massacre). The festival had an overwhelmingly good response and the group plans to do it again in 2010, hoping to further secure the creation and maintenance of a dynamic death rock scene in Toronto.

&gt; ‚ÄúCreation is evolution‚Äù Carruthers says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I figure we were trying to say with A Primitive Evolution. As evolved as we think we are as humans or animals, we are very much in the beginning of the evolution of mankind. We have so much to learn and yet so much has changed in the last hundred years; we have a long way to go as a species. We wanted our band to reflect that too, to just go off of what we feel, do it out of instinct and evolve naturally. Have some fun existing on this planet.‚Äù

&gt; Produced by Carruthers and Matthew Von Wagner, who has produced U.S.S. and Alpha Galates as well as worked alongside Joe Barresi and Bob Ludwig, A.P.E. is grounded on a few common themes. ‚ÄúDeath on Wheels‚Äù draws inspiration from classic grindhouse horror films, while others like ‚ÄúDead End‚Äù are thinly veiled love songs. ‚ÄúWar B.‚Äù explores political undertones and the Western view of war. ‚ÄúBeyond True‚Äù and ‚ÄúStill Waiting‚Äù draw influences of Radiohead and U2 with an amped up feel uniting the main themes of the album and capturing the romanticism of human interaction. Prepare yourself for a band that is as primal as they are passionate, as convicting as they are creative, and as solid as they are sinister. As CHARTattack stated, ""If you're not from Toronto or you don't know what I'm talking about, I feel sorry for you, because A Primitive Evolution are a rock 'n' roll wet dream and they're sexy as f#&amp;k.""

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's RISHLOO continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool and Fair to Midland, RISHLOO strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of RISHLOO. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as RISHLOO. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, RISHLOO have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, RISHLOO continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada.  In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released January 2015.

We forgot about it after a couple weeks and moved on with our lives. I decided to google our group name a few months later to see how many followers our soundcloud had amassed and what do I find? Some Russian music hosting site had taken the songs and uploaded it onto there. The most surprising part was it had like 10,000 listeners. I was like ""What the actual fuck?"". Our soundcloud even to this day only has 204 followers and Reverbnation has 167. For some reason, those Russians really liked what we made and we got fairly popular. I guess you could say we're somewhat famous in Russia. That was years ago and I can't find the Russian hosting site anymore but I thought it was kinda cool that so many people so far away from us liked the bullshit, unprofessional beats that we made and we had no idea about it.

&gt; EVYLTYDE are a British metal band based in the London area who bring the sound of traditional, classic metal into the modern age with a mix of killer riffs, searing power chords and powerful, melodic vocals!!!

&gt; The group was established in August 2013 by Danny Merton (guitars) and Hannah Delany (vocals) after both met while being recruited for another band. When that project fell through, they quickly set about recording a number of tracks for independent release.

&gt; ‚ÄúFight To Be Free‚Äù was the first of these tracks and is a homage of sorts to classic British metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Released during the traditional Christmas Chart period in 2013 and due to its lyrical content being inspired by events such as the Arab Spring, Libya and the war in Syria, EVYLTYDE are dedicated to giving all profits from the sales of the single to charity.

&gt; In late 2013, bassist Paul James (formerly VIRUS) permanently joined EVYLTYDE to add even greater depth to what was already an extremely powerful core and in July 2014 EVYLTYDE released their second single ‚ÄúKiller‚Äù, the video for which received over 1,000 views on YouTube in its first few weeks and was subsequently showcased on a number of internet radio shows.

&gt; With a number of drummer changes in the first half of 2014, EVYLTYDE finally settled with Isaac Marques (previously 101% PANTERA), a stalwart of the London depping scene who finally hung-up his mercenary hat to join the band full-time. 

&gt; Soon after, to celebrate recording their debut album, the band released a third single ‚ÄúSkin Deep‚Äù in early October 2014 as a free download on their Reverbnation page with the song hitting over 1,500 plays on Soundcloud.

&gt; In May 2015, Jamie Butler (formerly F.S.I and INSIDE THE CIRCLE) replaced Paul James as EVYLTYDE‚Äôs bassist to bring even more influences to the band as they start to prepare material for their follow-up album.

&gt; With over 25 shows under their belt in just over 12 months, EVYLTYDE have performed at some of the UK‚Äôs most iconic small venues including The Dublin Castle and The Water Rats (London), Retro Bar (Manchester) and the O2 Academy Birmingham and within a relatively short amount of time have been lucky enough to share the stage with some other great independent UK metal acts including, BEHOLDER, DETHONATOR, SKREAMER, SLAM CARTEL and NWOBHM originators SACRILEGE.

&gt; It was also announced in May (2015) that EVYLTYDE would be the main support for the legendary Graham Bonnet (RAINBOW, ALCATRAZZ) and his band on their AUGUST 2015 UK TOUR, thus adding the cherry on top of what has already been an amazing year for the band. Read more on Last.fm.

It helps to have them somewhere as a record, for example you could save a Google Doc with the song details and (Copyright symbol) your name and the year, so there is a date that you saved it.

If you do live performance or have music online then you should join ASCAP, BMI, APRA or whoever your local music rights organization is, because they will help you collect the pittance you are entitled to as royalties. They will have a page where you can register your songs. (reminds self that half of my recent songs aren't registered yet). This has nothing to do with your copyright but it doesn't hurt and if you post songs on Reverbnation, YouTube, Spotify etc, they will collect royalties which in many cases will be a small fraction of a cent per play. but I digress.

If you are going to do a co-write you need to agree upfront on a percentage split before you even start and if you do a Google Search you should find a split agreement form, or otherwise one of the above organizations will have them for free on their website. There are multiple types of royalties and again the organizations above have information about them. 

Recordings have nothing to do with songwriting copyright. If you are registered with one of the organizations above and your split is documented with them, you're entitled to royalties from any and all recordings that are played (being a little simplistic). It doesn't matter if 100 covers bands play or record your songs, the songwriter gets credit. Hope that helps a little. For more details, go to the organizations I mentioned above.

&gt; Folk metal music band from Spain that mixes traditional music, traditional inspired music and its own way of doing metal music. The lyrics are normally inspired in a mix of tales and legends from several european peoples (celtic peoples, castilians, germanic peoples...) with a special flavour of fun and jokes about parties and getting drunk.

&gt; By the end of 2010, a simple thought started to shape as a project in Juli√°n's and Gustavo's minds. Soon Juli√°n presented some compositions, with international folk bands as references, and started to play them together. They both decided to advance in that project, so they contacted some friends and ‚Äúfriends of friends‚Äù to complete the formation. Vity, Lucky and David didn't doubt for a moment to join the band, in January of 2011 the band consolidated itself with a first formation of drums, bass, two guitars, bagpipe and flutes. Thanks to the friendship between the members and the different styles they all had played before, the band evolved very fast in a little time.

&gt; In May of 2011, Lucky left the band due to lack of time and Patricia joined as violinist. At the end of May the band has already enough compositions to work on its first album, that was recorded and mixed during summer at DZG studios (Dezege Producciones) and mastered at Finnvox by Mika Jussila in September 2011. The artwork was carried by Jan Yrlund at Dargrove design and was finished by November 2011. The album, called ‚ÄúTirikantam‚Äù, was released December 23rd 2011, and presented in the ‚ÄúTirikantam Winter Tour‚Äù, in Ciudad Real (Dec 23rd), Cuenca (Dec 30th) and Madrid (Jan 7th).

&gt; Since little before releasing ‚ÄúTirikantam‚Äù and during winter and spring, the band members dedicated their time to compose new songs and prepare performances for the summer, playing in festivals both as secondary band as main band, and performing other independent acts in different spots of the Spanish geography, through the provinces of Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Toledo, Zaragoza, A Coru√±a and Pontevedra. Specially emphasizing ‚ÄúGall√¶cia Folk Metal Fest‚Äù and ‚ÄúKeltoi Fest 2012‚Äù.

&gt; By the end of August 2012, David formally presents to the band his own research and personal rebuilding of the celtiberian language, the language called ‚Äúkeltokurmis‚Äù or ‚Äúceltibeerian‚Äù, a language inferred from known fragments of Celtiberian, Proto-celtic and other languages within the celtic branch of Indoeuropean languages, in order to recreate a cultural and linguistical background for some lyrics, although there was already some resarch done for ‚ÄúTirikantam‚Äù. After the summer the band continues with more timely-spaciated performances to dedicate the time almost entirely to the composition of a new album, which will try to release along 2013. Little before ending 2012, the band inscribed itself in the Rolling Rock Bar bands contest performing a first show as contestant, and then after being selected, a second and final show as contest finalist, being the winner of the First Award.

&gt; In January 2013, the band participates in the Viking Fest Espa√±a first edition, called Gatuperio Viking Fest in Madrid, where a little advance of the second album is made with two songs called ‚ÄúEimos to katum‚Äù (We're marching to war) and ‚ÄúKladimoi‚Äù (Swords).The tour continues reaching different parts of the Spanish geography as Granada, Cordoba, La Gineta (Albacete), Madrid again, and of course, Ciudad Real, among others, both in concerts and at festivals such as GinetaRock, Estayike Rock. Celtibeerian shares the stage with important bands both nationally and internationally (Zarpa, Hora Zulu, Ankhara, Jos√© Rubio‚Äôs Nova Era, Firewind (GRE), Sinbreed (GER), M√•negarm (SWE), F√§ng√∂rn (RUS), ‚Ä¶). 

&gt; At this point, David Garc√≠a decides to leave the band due to personal reasons. He is replaced by David S√°nchez (M√∂rrighan) who plays viola, bagpipe, whistles, bouzouki, harp and vocals. After this line-up change, the band is being strengthened again as a 5-membered band. In September, the band came back to Dezege Studios to start the recording of the second album called ‚ÄúKeltorevolution‚Äù, which is going to release in March 2014 ( Out now!).

Apparently it takes some time before reverbnation takes a song posted to my Basement Cat page and posts the song on its own page.  It was there this morning, so I used that link to replace the fb link.

I performed everything on the recording except drums, which is a loop in GarageBand.  Typically my recording process starts with me figuring out the tempo and choosing a drum loop, and applying that tempo to the loop.  I'll then play the rhythm guitar while listening to the drums, to stay in time.  Next, I will record the lead vocals.  If the song has backing vocals, I will add them after the lead vocals are recorded.  I didn't add bass guitar to this recording, but when I do, it gets recorded after the rhythm guitar, as are any guitar solos.

It's the only thing on that site that it's really good for other than hosting tracks (which you can do yourself for much cheaper). Works out to be about $35 for 25 reviews. Of those usually about 10 are in-depth usable feedback.

Some examples from my latest one (both some ok feedback, and some of the ""didn't like it"" feedback - which I find more useful):

&gt;8/10: Its an alright track, but it sounds more like a video game. I did like the track, the beats, the production, and the stereo effects. The ending wasn't appropriate, the end sounded like a fade out in the middle of the track. I was expecting a more dramatic ending. The video game effects was a little bit overkill, and took away some of the energy of the track.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;6/10:  A drum and bass song with alot of electronica techno on top. The synths are really wave and flashy. The vocal samples are annoying. I think the song is put together well, but I really just dont like it. Its kinda annoying. The main synths are just super annoying to hear. Its really zappy and screechy. Oh this part with the piano is ok. Theres just way to much going on its kinda overload. Hmmm the ending just adds more lol. I dunno I sorta like this but its kinda annoying. Just the main synths are too high pitched. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1/10: Odd opening, random noises with incredibly fast paced techno instrumentals. It's scattered sounding and interspersed with a disembodied voice spewing nonsense. It's headache inducing and makes you anxious just to hear it. Gimmicky and very stupid, I disliked it very much. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4/10:  Classical music was not designed to be remixed like this. The end product is too busy and dissonant to make for pleasurable listening. Most of the track seems to want to distract the listener from actually listening to the piece. No knock on the artist - I know he's done better stuff like l'Autoroute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is the negative feedback going to stop me? No. It just means that the track isn't ready yet.  (I didn't include the overly positive ones - I'm more interested in the middle ground, because those are either people who like it, but didn't like elements of it, or who hate it, but are too polite to say so). The useful feedback here is:

* Too much going on at once for people to track it properly/too busy.
* Too much reliance on higher-register saws.
* Sounds videogamey. 
* Ending is poor - doesn't climax properly, and just repeats earlier material, which means I'm missing a bridge, or need to vary it up somehow - and get the intensity up. 
* People don't like the Speak 'n' Spell voice. Well... shit, that's the joke and part of the story in this track, so that's staying, dislike be damned.

I'm still getting to grips with structure, and still experimenting. Once I get my current batch of tracks out into the world, I'm going to spend some serious time dismantling other tracks to see if I can identify what my stuff is missing that people are expecting.",,,,,,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_9aikaj,,,,/r/edmproduction/comments/9aikaj/do_you_guys_also_battle_with_getting_demoralized/e4w15yh/,public,,,,,,1535327958.0,r/edmproduction,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1320799866.0,1537964353.0,,,,

Hi! My name is Ken. I am working on creating my initial CD release of Native American Style Solo Flute Music later this year. The YouTube channel listed above has a playlist of around 45 minutes (and growing) of DEMO improvisational songs with new songs being added weekly. I would consider it an honor if you felt compelled to subscribe.

I am sharing some of my music, in a very raw (demo) kind of form, with the world. The idea - The ""Heart Songs"" Playlist.

In the Native American Flute playing world, you often hear the term ""play from the heart"" this simply means to pick up the flute and start playing and let whatever comes out be the musical expression for the moment. This is a daily practice of mine. Recently, my wife convinced me to start recording these improvisations on my phone - so I did. These improvisations are what make up the ""Heart Songs"" playlists.

I will have to ask for some mercy here. Because each of the songs is recorded on the fly, the sound quality may not be great or you may hear me mess up a little bit here and there (but I usually find my way back :) These are not rehearsed or planned out before I press record. They are improvised on the spot and would have never been heard again had I not recorded them. Some fine tuning of the sound quality and effects have been added to enhance the final mix that you hear, but it is by no means polished.

I currently have audio only on SoundCloud - [https://soundcloud.com/kenmcgarity](https://soundcloud.com/kenmcgarity)

and also on ReverbNation - [https://www.reverbnation.com/kenmcgarity](https://www.reverbnation.com/kenmcgarity)

These ""audio only"" sites include the same songs from my YouTube channel with the edition of songs that I have not yet created / released video slideshows of.

One of my goals for 2018 is to release a self produced album / cd of higher production quality songs by the end of the year. The learning curve on this endeavor has been bigger than I imagined, but I am still on track at this point. I will hopefully let you know more about that towards the end of the year.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope that the music of the Native American Flute finds a special place in your heart, as it has in mine.

We used to get a little bit of income from the original MP3 com website, but that is long gone. There were a few other music websites that were for ‚Äúyoung‚Äù artists, but one by one they went down. All replaced with this subscription model for streaming websites. And what I don‚Äôt understand is why Universal is not suing Spotify Pandora and all of the other music sites like they did MP3 com? Because that‚Äôs why MP3 COM is gone, because they dared to put up streaming media. But now it is not only accepted, it has become the norm and it really doesn‚Äôt do anybody any good, because both artists and listeners alike are BILKED. Listeners have to pay exorbitant subscription fees, and artists have to pay up to $300 to be hosted.

Where as radio, all you really had to do was give your records to the radio stations and when they played them you got paid. But unfortunately radio is controlled by clearchannel now which I believe is some kind of KOCH Enterprise? So radio is not really what it used to be back in the 50s through the 70s. These days if your band and songs are not included in clearchannels playlist, then you do not get played. In fact metallica understood this which is why they originally allowed bootlegging of their live concerts which made them millions of followers and fans, but then when MP3 com was created what did they do? They started an anti-MP3 crusade and became instant laughing stocks. You see they forgot where they came from.

Up until now I just used Pandora, but now they are starting the same kind of garbage. Every time I start the app it‚Äôs a nag screen for some kind of subscription service. So I decided long ago none of these jerks get any of my money for any reason whatsoever. Sometimes I get a little bit of money from ReverbNation because we have our albums connected to us on that website so we‚Äôve got royalties that have yet to be paid, and it‚Äôs much more than what Spotify has ever given us. And? It‚Äôs free, completely free for the users to listen to any of it. But as far as bands, there are levels of payment options so you can start in with the basics and it helps you. And it‚Äôs not very much. You see it is a site created specifically for the benefit of the artist and you make of it what you make of it, you have to do all the work. but Spotify is not for the benefit of anybody, all of their income comes from listeners and artists and believe me they make a hell of a lot more money than what other people have said here, they make a lot.",,,,flair-default,,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.3.1'}]",False,,,,,False,,True,t3_97kkmu,,dark,,/r/jailbreak/comments/97kkmu/discussion_is_it_morally_wrong_to_steal_from/e4do2v2/,public,,,,"iPhone 6s Plus, iOS 11.3.1",,1534544630.0,r/jailbreak,0,,,,,,reverbnation,,,,,,1387807642.0,1537655746.0,,,,

For my band, we put all earnings into a centralized ""band fund"", and use that money to cover expenses. If you **have** to have members contribute X per month, I suppose that's fine (maybe set up a centralized paypal account?), but might cause friction later on. 

Communication on upcoming expenses and having people save up, then pay for the thing when the bill is due may be an easier pill to swallow than X per month.

Touring: I think you may be focusing on the wrong target. Work to find **bands** in the areas that you want to tour instead of promoters. Use Reverbnation, IndieOnTheMove, Facebook (via google advanced search), etc. Befriend those people and ask them if they want to put a show together. Most promoters I know are either idiots, thieves, or only work with mid-tier touring bands. 

Use the ""circle of influence"" approach (also called the 5-point-crushing-star by Martin Atkins) - find locations within an hour to two hours of your hometown, start dominating those markets, then increase your sphere. Cheaper, easier, and better results than doing large, longer tours.

Holy fuck. The corn is real with that guy. Meanwhile, Madison Rayne is losing her goddamn mind courtesy of Su Yung, Killer Kross made Petey Williams pass out twice in a match (not to mention *let Petey attempt a Canadian Destroyer just so he could show everyone it wasn't gonna work*), LAX Civil War is coming to a head with Ortiz and Santana (backed by Konnan) defending the tag titles against the original LAX, Homicide and Hernandez (now called The OGz and backed by King (FKA Eddie Kingston. Not quite the Outlaw Inc. reunion I was expecting but sure.)) in a 5150 Street Fight, Tessa Blanchard and Allie are all up in eachother's grills, Matt Sydal's banking on his spirituality giving him the edge over Brian Cage (I honestly don't get a lot of this ""third eye"" stuff), Eddie Edwards is reaching Samuel Shaw levels of nutty, and Pentagon Jr. kidnapped Sami Callihan, tied him to a chair, let the Crists think Sami was him by leaving the mask Callihan took from him on his face which lead to them beating on him, *and then he fucking tries to snap Jake and Dave's arms while Callihan is screaming at him to stop.*

If I didn't know any better I'd think Pentagon was the bad guy.

I've been helping my dad build our new barn. Cement foundation, all stone, chimney, loft, pizza oven and barbeque built in, it's gonna look good. I just don't remember my job being so painful.... I've taken like 6 or 8 Advil tablets since Wednesday.

So apparently there's a Power Rangers/Street Fighter crossover with Ryu and Chun-Li teaming with Gia from Megaforce and Tommy Oliver to fight M.Bison. This live-action short film comes after a PR/SF crossover event in the mobile fighter Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, *and has Ryu actually morphing.* I haven't seen a crossover this bizarre since Thanos in Fortnite. In not as crazy sounding news, Voldo has been confirmed for SoulCalibur VI. You know, the guy who looks like he escaped from a really fucked up sex dungeon and has those cool katars he fights with.

Being a guitarist can be either a cheap hobby if you go for the cheapest stuff, or a wildly expensive hobby that will crush you financially if you‚Äôre not responsible with your money. You could say that‚Äôs true about a lot of things, but with guitars (at least electric ones) comes new strings, set-ups, cables, cases (not always included with the guitar), maybe some pedals, an amp (maybe two depending on things), guitar stands, a strap, maybe some recording gear (this is its own, entirely separate set of expenses), picks, etc., etc., etc. ... And there is a lot of variability in price depending on what you‚Äôre looking at for all of those items. 

That‚Äôs just for electric. Acoustic guitars can be super expensive too. Same for concert classical guitars. 

For concert classical guitars, you don‚Äôt get one at a big music store like Guitar Center, Sam Ash, Reverbnation, you go to a very reputable dealer or luthier who knows what they‚Äôre talking about. The cheapest guitar they sell really may be like, $4,000 USD. It‚Äôs nuts how expensive those things can get. I remember I booked an appointment for one of these stores and played some models and really, I think the cheapest one I played was around $3,700 USD. This is back when I had been admitted to a program and was seriously considering so I was shopping around for an upgrade. I got one but now am doing something totally different lol. Funny how life works out. I say this not in the spirit of gate keeping, but being a guitarist (musician in general) really is a great way to always ensure you‚Äôre spending loads of money hahaha.

&gt; Quaker City Night Hawks' brand of hard rock n' roll is bred from Texas boogie, Memphis soul and heavy blues. Their music is southern rock right out of '75, played with the fervor of a sermon crackling out of the radio in a '68 Lincoln. They're the whiskey bottle you finished Saturday night and the prayer you said the next morning. Like a country gunshot on a humid night and your first illicit beer, Quaker City Night Hawks are the spirit of rock n' roll. Come shake your hips.

As a software developer, I can tell your that it's going to be a long hard fight to build something that will surpass these existing tools. It's an over-saturated market, and generally I find artists don't want to manage multiple website subscriptions. The other problem is that non musicians don't frequent these sites, so how will you add more value than something like instagram? 

I'm in Calgary, Canada, and I find the thing missing in my city is industry people. Managers, promoters, indie labels, marketing gurus. I don't need new software, I need people with knowledge and connections that I can work with.

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's RISHLOO continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool and Fair to Midland, RISHLOO strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of RISHLOO. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as RISHLOO. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, RISHLOO have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, RISHLOO continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada.  In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released January 2015.

 My eyes wont watch my brothers die

 I stand here, shaken to my core

 Moving on, as my soldiers cry

 Underneath this great sky, many wars i have seen

 Many years have gone by, battered shields and bloodied steel

 On and on we march to fight. Man and steed flew like dust

 Pushing through with sinister might, merciless hordes with raging blood lust 

Too much blood lies on my hand 

Too many friends never to be seen again

 Bodies and amour fill the land

 On we destroy, lives of men

 Wings of war they pushed us forth, through grazed fields and wasted land

 We held our breath and drew our swords

 The fate of people crumbling in our hands

 A thousand eyes so filled with pain ,up from the ground stare at me

 and the gravestones of the slain, they hum a hateful melody 

Valhalla! As i stare at death,

 single tear i cry

 Silent weep for the wasted blood that dried 

On this very land on which i now stand

 Do remember me,

 i pray unto thee

First off, don‚Äôt even look at ReverbNation as other have suggested. It doesn‚Äôt work and no one who works in the music industry as their actual profession uses it. Almost all of the ‚Äúoffers and opportunities‚Äù on there are scams wanting you to pay for like rating your music, etc. 

Secondly, unless you have a really generous budget, you‚Äôre not going to get a lot of traction with PR as a new artist. All the big firms (like Rogers and Cowan) will have EDM depts but you‚Äôre talking $10-15k a month. 

Even a smaller boutique firm like mine (but again we don‚Äôt do EDM) would charge around $5k a month, with a 3 month minimum. 

For that $15k you‚Äôre going to maybe get one or two pickups with a large outlet like Billboard and a handful of smaller to medium sized blogs that specialize in your genre. 

You may not think that‚Äôs worth it, but it‚Äôs a LOT of work pitching a new artist. It takes relationships built over time. You can‚Äôt just eblast everyone and get results. These journalists get hundreds of emails and calls a week for new artists and they maybe only do 1-2 stories a month on them. Why? Because they have to drive traffic to their site or they won‚Äôt get paid or won‚Äôt have a job for long. And some dude dropping beats from his parent‚Äôs basement in OH isn‚Äôt gonna cut it. 

So continuing on... you‚Äôve had a few pieces written about you but you realize your Soundcloud or YouTube has only gone up about 100 views. The thing is, most people don‚Äôt pay attention to the ‚Äúnew artist‚Äù pieces because well they care more about Avicii‚Äôs cause of death so they don‚Äôt click play on your Soundcloud embed on the piece that was just posted about you. 

The ones that DO get hype and listened to are usually the developing artists that can be tied with a big name in the article title, to draw the crowd. ‚ÄúProduced by Kanye,‚Äù  ‚ÄúManaged by Scooter Braun‚Äù etc. 

So all in all, you‚Äôve just spent $15k for a couple hundred new plays, if you‚Äôre lucky. You tell me if that‚Äôs worth it to you. 

This is why people do the social media route before attempting any type of PR. For PR to be effective, you gotta have a great story/schtick and really fucking phenomenal tracks. PR will only get you so far. You need people to share and be taking about you organically for it to all come together. And even then, it‚Äôs still like a lottery. 

With social media you can get your music in front of listeners (even target EDM specifically with some ads) and see if they are at least interested in your product (your music). 

Anyway, I hope that gives you some insight on how PR works. Not trying to deter you away but also don‚Äôt want you to spend a lot of money with high expectations.

t5_2sxuv,,,,False,,,,,,,musicbusiness,,,,,,dy26t0z,,,0,False,,True,clebo99,False,True,t1_dy21reg,3,,,,,,"So a ReverbNation page (and I've included my bands here) is a simple location where folks/bar owners/etc can see the band, listen to clips, etc.  It's like $20/month but worth it.  You don't necessarily need your own webpage like the old days.  Also, make a FB page and have all your friends be fans of you.  

So what we did to start out was play very small places for very little money.  Now, we are just 3 so our options of places to play is interesting in that we can play very small venues.  The challenge is that we can't play huge rooms (which we don't necessarily care but that is a challenge).   If you guys are a big band, then it is tough to get into smaller rooms, which is where a lot of people start.  

You aren't going to get good paying gigs off the bat.  You just aren't.  So you need to go hat in hand and say we will play for ""x"".  Never pay to play but you guys may only get $100 for the first few shows.  One of the best things you can do is find a place and have them book you as a regular (like once a month or something).  You'd be amazed how that plus 1-2 other gigs fills the calendar and  it looks like you guys are really hustling/playing.  

What you can also do is say ""ok, we will do this first gig for free but we get tips and $50 bar tab.  If we do well, you book us 4-5 times at ""x"" price"".   And make sure you pack that place.  Bar owners/clubs care about making money, that's all.  You can have Bono/Sting/Geddy Lee and Charlie Watts playing a show and if no one is there, they won't book you back.  

Keep asking questions if you have them.

- First, your music needs to be good in quality and in talent.  I'm going to assume that you have both, but you should have others listen and verify.  

- Second, $1500 is a lot for a show.  I'm not sure where you are playing but professional bands that have been playing for a long time make that.  The band I'm in (a trio) plays for about $400 here in the east coast/mid-atlantic.  

- Third, you need to hit the bars/clubs and ask and start calling/emailing.  Do you have a ReverbNation page??

- Fourth, going back to the money.  You should never pay to play, but getting smaller gigs fills your calendar and that is what bars/clubs want to see.  They see that others have booked you so they will.  

- Fifth, most large cities have Booking Agents that run a lot of the clubs. They want bands that are professional, can draw and sound good.  The first places you play may suck, but you play them anyway and get gigs under your belt.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so. 

&gt; Formed In: April 2012
Hometown Location: Hessle, UK and Portage, IN.

&gt; Infant Anninilator is a British/American deathcore project currently consisting of Eddie Pickard (guitars/bass), Aaron Kitcher (drums) and Dickie Allen (vocals)

&gt; While Pickard and Kitcher are England natives, their vocalist spot has always been taken by an American. Their original vocalist Dan Watson recorded with the band via sending his vocals to the members and their debut album with Watson (The Palable Leprosy of Polution) was released in late 2012. However, the band recorded with their current vocalist (Dickie Allen) in the same room. Their second album The Elysian Grandeval Gal√®riarch was recorded and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at his home studio Kirkbride Recordings and was released in 2016.

&gt; Due to the members residing in different countries, Infant Anninilator has never played live and never announced plans to do so. 

&gt; Formed In: April 2012
Hometown Location: Hessle, UK and Portage, IN.

&gt; THE MAYAN FACTOR - Baltimore, Maryland
Progressive Rock/Alternative Rock
Facebook, ReverbNation
One word to describe The Mayan Factor is haunting. A listen to any song and you will never forget it. To hear either their melodies or Ray's lyrics is to be renewed. Together they blend into an irresistible force of inspirational creativity. Bridging the abyss of unreal to real, the spiritually dead to the vital, these guys are genuine, their warmth contrasting with the vapid corporate chill of modern culture. Living samplers, each man engulfs a smorgasbord of musical styles but they never tack anything on because they can do it. Their music wells from the wellspring of their souls. The old medicine is dead and with it spring. The last tricks have been tried, the last tapestry of their lies woven. The system is corrupt. The system is bankrupt. We await the wall to fall. Turn your ears to the new dispensation. Turn your hearts from the grave.Tune your hearts to the heart of The Mayan Factor...

&gt; The Mayan Factor have an ethnic sound, using atmospheric percussion (kongas and drums), acoustic guitars, various keyboard samples and tribal bass to an melodic, intense effect. The Mayan Factor could equally be called progressive rock as they could be lumped into the space rock category, one thing setting them apart from most artists in these genres is that the vocalist raps on occasion. Don't let this deter you, because it's an altogether interesting and one of a kind experience. Formed in 2002, they have released two full-length albums, ""In Lake 'ch"" (2003) and ""44"" (2005). With the return of Dan Angermaier on drums, and Johnny Burke replacing Brian Scott on guitar, The Mayan Factor was moving forward with a 3rd album that they hoped to release in 2011. However, the singer Ray Schuler died on February 8th 2011  due to a heroin overdose, which put the band on indefinite hiatus.

&gt; NOW, the 3rd  album by The Mayan Factor is available. The album is called Yesterday's Son. Originally these 7 songs started off as demo's, but after Ray's passing, the band went back in and re-recorded the instrumental tracks behind Ray's vocals and guitar. With the help of Frank Marchand as engineer and producer, they have created an emotional roller coaster that serves as a beautiful final offering to themselves and the fans. Breathe it in - Yesterday's Son - and all of The Mayan Factor's music available at cdbaby,  iTunes and many other digital outlets.

If you are going the self-promotion route, you have a number of great options. Something that is vitally important to remember from the outset is to be patient. This stuff takes time and effort, but is totally doable. Also keep in mind, you are building your brand, not just selling music.

Start with the free stuff like social media: 
1. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Create accounts specifically for your music and keep fans up to date on gigs and new releases. Share pictures of the shows and sell your merchandise (sites like CafePress, Zazzle, and RedBubble are great for this)
2. Take advantage of tools like: ReverbNation, Sound Cloud, Band Camp, YouTube, CD Baby, and Patreon.
3. Get social and network with others. Find a mentor. Most people are willing and open to share if you are genuine.

Remember, there are literally billions of listeners out there, so stay focused on finding your fans. Avoid getting into a competitive mindset and comparing yourself to others. Keep working, keep writing, and diligently develop yourself, your craft, and your brand.

But unfortunately, as far as the internet's concerned, I think that's where you're going to get the most mileage off of your activity. All the venues post their calendars on there and most of the networking that I'm familiar with happens in some of those private groups I was talking about or through the messenger. I've certainly used ReverbNation for years and other like services, but I really don't think those act as an actual social network but rather an aggregate for a bunch of mainstream type opportunities and contests. Though I think it is important to note that not all of networking is done over the internet, I would say the vast majority of making connections that leads to future gigs happens in person. At least as far as the community that I'm a part of and aware of, I don't think there's much activity elsewhere online besides Facebook. Just frequenting the venues that you would like to play at on a regular basis and getting to know either the managers or the booking guy or the owner first name goes a long way. Unfortunately making these connections takes a lot of time out of everywhere else. You kind of have to be a familiar face and then it's a lot easier to book a gig. I wish I could help you as far as that region was concerned but there's not much that I know about that area. I played for years in a prog band called The Raven Charter (2005-2017) from Denton.  We all met at UNT but once we graduated they all moved to Dallas in 2010. So that's why I have experience in both Denton and Dallas scenes. But I grew up in Fort Worth and I've lived here since 2010 so that's how I know about the Fort Worth scene. I currently play in Huffer for original music. We've gotten a little acclaim from the FW Weekly. I also play in The Foo ( Foo fighters), The Kombucha Mushroom People ( System of a down) and Sweetmeat (Top 40) for my cover projects. If you want you can post the links to your bands' pages and if we ever need another band to play with I can hit you up.

Martian is a 22-year-old male who has struggled his whole life with family, money, and music. He lives in Las Vegas and from age 5 he wanted to make music as a career. His mother quickly put those dreams down. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dumb you should be a lawyer or a doctor. Do something that‚Äôs not just a dumb dream‚Äù
She died when I was 10 years old due to a pill overdose. Already poor, I moved in with my auntie and 3 cousins. Two years of always starving at the last 2 weeks of the month, my uncle life was taken due to an overdose. Two years later my auntie met the same end. My dad ended up raising me for the rest of the time I had to become an adult. Once I turned 18 I began making music. The first 3 years of doing so I was horrible so I kept practicing to become better. 6 years of struggling to get my music career off the ground and now I have gotten better. I am now looking for supports to help me turn my life around and to allow me to live a passion that will never fade. Will you be the one to help a young artist on his feet? Or will I be stuck walking down a road of struggling to become a musician? The choice is in the hands of the people.

This is a project to make a 100% high quality album. If I have made 7 songs by myself to give you an idea of the type of music to I make. Please enjoy the song I made called ‚ÄúTake Off‚Äù. 
I have a 30 second demo and a full song. The 30 second demo is a snippet of the full song. Support me on my pages below as well.

&lt;p&gt;Martian is a 22-year-old male who has struggled his whole life with family, money, and music. He lives in Las Vegas and from age 5 he wanted to make music as a career. His mother quickly put those dreams down. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs dumb you should be a lawyer or a doctor. Do something that‚Äôs not just a dumb dream‚Äù
She died when I was 10 years old due to a pill overdose. Already poor, I moved in with my auntie and 3 cousins. Two years of always starving at the last 2 weeks of the month, my uncle life was taken due to an overdose. Two years later my auntie met the same end. My dad ended up raising me for the rest of the time I had to become an adult. Once I turned 18 I began making music. The first 3 years of doing so I was horrible so I kept practicing to become better. 6 years of struggling to get my music career off the ground and now I have gotten better. I am now looking for supports to help me turn my life around and to allow me to live a passion that will never fade. Will you be the one to help a young artist on his feet? Or will I be stuck walking down a road of struggling to become a musician? The choice is in the hands of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project to make a 100% high quality album. If I have made 7 songs by myself to give you an idea of the type of music to I make. Please enjoy the song I made called ‚ÄúTake Off‚Äù. 
I have a 30 second demo and a full song. The 30 second demo is a snippet of the full song. Support me on my pages below as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Thermal and a Quarter, often abbreveated as TAAQ, is a Bangalore, India based rock band formed in 1996. The band consists of Bruce Lee Mani (guitars and vocals), Rajeev Rajagopal (drums) and Prakash KN (bass). Jason Zacharaiah (keyboards), Ravi Kulur (flute) and Prakash Sontakke (slide guitars and vocals) occasionally accompany the band during live shows. 

&gt; In Thermal and a Quarter's 16-year career, it has earned quite a reputation for fusing diverse styles into their rock music, from Indian classical music to jazz and funk. The band has released four albums to date: the self-titled debut in 1999, Jupiter Cafe in 2002 and subsequently Plan B (2006) and This Is It (2009). The band has toured quite a lot in recent years and has gained quite a fan following from all over the world.

&gt; Thermal and a Quarter's fourth full-length album This Is It was mixed by Multiple Grammy Award winning producer/engineer Jeff Peters (who has worked with the likes of The Beach Boys, Ringo Starr, Sarah Brightman, and Brian Setzer). The album earned itself a 3 1/2 star review from Rolling Stone Magazine.

&gt; The band has since released a few singles available for free on their Reverbnation page. March 2012 will see them tour USA and Singapore playing new songs and garnering new fans.

&gt; The name 'Thermal and a quarter' is a word play on Three Mallus and a quarter Mallu. (Mallu = someone speaking Malayalam/a native of Kerala,India) referring to the members' native state. Read more on Last.fm.

We also play a little of everything, including americana, blues, and rock and rolly type bluegrass. We're very much a jamband.

We've been together for about three months now and we've started to grab a real growing reputation in the area, and we've already had the chance to play on stage and support some big shows with big names from our genre, including ""leftover salmon"", ""The Lil Smokies"", ""Liver down the river"" out of Colorado, and coming up we're lined up to play at Taos' ""Music on the Mothership"" with headliners RailRoad Earth, and Moe. We're really excited and we're really eager for the future.

Heres our [Reverbnation](https://www.reverbnation.com/Thenoseeums) to check out some demos ive just released. They're all from a recent live show, no studio recording, so what you hear is what we've got. Ill be posting up some more in the near future.

Also check out our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thenoseeums). if you like what you hear stay connected with us to find updates on upcoming shows and new material/songs/albums.

&gt; Playing piano since 4 years old, her passion in music has never left. She hears sounds that are uniquely to her own. In this life to the world of sounds, she interprets everything she hears, real and imaginary, and shares her story and interpretation through music. ‚Äã‚Äã""If I can get one person to understand and connect how I felt at that time in my life, then the journey is also theirs which I think is beautiful. I love sharing my story and personally connecting to people that hear, see, and feel the way I am....""

&gt; Kitty Pae started hearing voices in her early 20s and writes music as a way of therapy. There is a need of sharing her journey of life and to help connect people similarly to her. ""I want people to know I am who I am, and no one can take that away from me. Hence, my songs are truly my diaries, a reflection of my feelings - a reflection of my life and I want to share them.""

&gt; Kitty Pae has gained multiple music scholarships including at Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music in Nashville and holds a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering. Using her technical skills, she combines this with her classical training in music theory &amp; composition to create her pieces using Ableton Live and a midi keyboard.

&gt; She is ranked #1 regionally in the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Area, #5 Nationally (USA) and #7 Globally in the Ambient, Electronica genres on Reverbnation.  

&gt; She works in the studio with the renowned GRAMMY winning producer James Cravero at East Coast Recording Company.

Jesse Smith - Drums

&gt; Formed in late 2002, Seattle's RISHLOO continue to gain wide-spread recognition for their dynamic sound, thought-provoking lyrics and intense live performance. Often compared to bands like Dredg, The Mars Volta, Tool and Fair to Midland, RISHLOO strives to push the envelope of psychedelic, progressive art-rock, drawing inspiration from classic artists like The Beatles, David Bowie, and Pink Floyd, while incorporating the modern experimentation and emotional depth of artists such as Tori Amos, Deftones, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree and more.

&gt; In February 2012 the band announced that Andrew, the vocalist, decided to leave the band, this being the unexpected end of RISHLOO. The remaining members briefly formed the band The Ghost Apparatus, until late in 2013 when Andrew and the band rejoined forces. On October 10th 2013 the band announced that they had decided to move forward making music as RISHLOO. 

&gt; Continuing as they have since their inception as an entirely independent venture, RISHLOO have sold 5,500+ units of their debut album, Terras Fames (2004) and 9,500+ units of their sophomore effort, Eidolon (2007) while attracting tens of thousands of fans online from around the globe. Interest in the band continues to grow exponentially on sites such as Myspace, Facebook, YouTube, ReverbNation and Last.FM.

&gt; With a lot of hard work and much appreciated help from their fans, RISHLOO continue to travel and perform whenever possible throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada.  In the course of their adventures, they have been privileged to share the stage with artists like Karnivool, Papa Roach, Fair to Midland, Ashes Divide, Sevendust, Trapt, Strata and Judas Priest.

&gt; The band's latest effort, Living as Ghosts with Buildings as Teeth, was released January 2015.

As we are trying to appeal to a huge market, we are ultimately competing against a lot of other services that are well-known and established. Some services are not very well known to the general public but are popular in the music community. Some sites that are obviously well known and mainstream are obviously SoundCloud, Spotify, Last.fm, but other competitors that we are ultimately trying to compete against, such as Reverbnation and Beatstars.

We are confident that we have unique and differentiating factors in our service to musicians and music lovers, and that we provide a platform that incorporates a social media hub and a music streaming service. We push for visibility and recognition across musicians, artists and bands that are not mainstream (yet!). 

We think in a hugely saturated market, we have found the sweet spot of untapped value, that we can in turn present to our audience a viable, enjoyable and exciting service.

&gt; Delaware has never been known for bringing out young bands trying to gain recognition, but until now none have broken out as well as Dover‚Äôs Awake At Last. Falling on the more progressive side of the rock world, the four-piece draws influence from bands like The Used and rock bands like Saosin. Awake At Last has found an aggressive blend of radio rock and pop melodies that create a whirlwind of emotion and with a live energy that matches the high energy of their recordings, AAL aims to travel the world playing unforgettable shows and captivate their fans.

&gt; Formed in 2011, Awake At Last -- featuring vocalist Vincent Torres, guitarist Eric Blackway, bassist Tyler Greene, and drummer Bryan Mills ‚Äì continues to bring a fresh sound to the Delaware music scene. Vincent Torres comments, ‚ÄúSome kids will only listen to a specific genre or a specific band, but for the most part the public just likes good live music and can make the best of whatever situation.‚Äù Being a band with a solid sound has helped boost AAL‚Äôs overall recognition and has ranked them as Dover‚Äôs number one rock group on Reverbnation charts. ‚ÄúWe've played some local shows for our local crowd where the venue is packed wall to wall and it's amazing. It all about making connections with our fans‚Äù explains guitarist Eric Blackway. Since the bands formation they have been on four east coast tours, one nationwide tour, and have played such festivals as SXSW, Heart of Texas Rock Fest, and Launch Music Festival, joining the stage with acts including Life On Repeat (Equal Vision Records), Us From Outside (Tragic Hero Records), and Life As A Ghost (Eulogy Records).

Lyrics:

**Donnie Don‚Äôt Live In That New York City No More**
*(Sung to the tune of ‚ÄúDaddy Don‚Äôt Live in that New York City No More‚Äù)*



Donnie don‚Äôt live in that New York City no more

Because Vladimir sent him crashing through the White House door

Donnie‚Äôs in Washington D.C.

Orders out from McDonalds and KFC

Donnie don‚Äôt live in that New York City no more


Donnie don‚Äôt star on that TV show no more

He can‚Äôt bother all the ladies, grab them like he did before

Donnie tweets from his telephone

While he chomps on burgers in his bed all alone

Donnie don‚Äôt live in that New York City no more

Driving on the green in a rented cart

Shaving down his score, like a work of art

You know he always plays the game with his cheating heart

Donnie don‚Äôt live in that New York City no more

He gets upset, make a threat, yells about nuclear war

Donnie wants to hide his every crime

But there‚Äôs a train closing in called Mueller time

Donnie don‚Äôt live in that New York City no more

&gt; Biography
In the fall of 2011, James Knoerl and Sam Harchik started the project you are now viewing as ‚ÄúAviations.‚Äù That autumn season was the beginning of an exceedingly hopeful path filled with meeting valued friends, countless learning experiences, and the breaking of today‚Äôs musical trends. 

&gt; Before admitting himself into Berklee College of Music out of high school, James had already been writing songs for a band that he knew he would intend to form. Once on campus, he joined forces with Sam. The two of them had a full album written, and soon they began recording. Shareef was made an addition to the band following his departure from a project of similar genre, and from then on, recording instrumentals for the album continued. The band had no legitimate plans for acquiring a vocalist for their musical venture, however, during the summer of 2012, Adam demoed on tracks and was given the spot. Dave Wolfberg from another Berklee band, Earthstomper, decided to join on as the second guitarist for the band.

&gt; On October 13th, 2012, ‚ÄúA Declaration of Sound,‚Äù the band‚Äôs debut release, was the final product of the story so far. 

&gt; Due to the intensive instrumentals and intricate rhythms constructed for their listeners. Aviations powers your ability to become involved with each song, forcing you to tend to individual parts with exclusive attention, while linking everything to a whole-sound with ease. If your comprehension enjoys a challenge, give them a listen. 

&gt; Stay tuned with their facebook page for updates on everything from their music, to shows, and even hilariously funny homemade videos. Comment on their pages- more than anything, they love hearing from the people who enjoy their music. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; THE MAYAN FACTOR - Baltimore, Maryland
Progressive Rock/Alternative Rock
Facebook, ReverbNation
One word to describe The Mayan Factor is haunting. A listen to any song and you will never forget it. To hear either their melodies or Ray's lyrics is to be renewed. Together they blend into an irresistible force of inspirational creativity. Bridging the abyss of unreal to real, the spiritually dead to the vital, these guys are genuine, their warmth contrasting with the vapid corporate chill of modern culture. Living samplers, each man engulfs a smorgasbord of musical styles but they never tack anything on because they can do it. Their music wells from the wellspring of their souls. The old medicine is dead and with it spring. The last tricks have been tried, the last tapestry of their lies woven. The system is corrupt. The system is bankrupt. We await the wall to fall. Turn your ears to the new dispensation. Turn your hearts from the grave.Tune your hearts to the heart of The Mayan Factor...

&gt; The Mayan Factor have an ethnic sound, using atmospheric percussion (kongas and drums), acoustic guitars, various keyboard samples and tribal bass to an melodic, intense effect. The Mayan Factor could equally be called progressive rock as they could be lumped into the space rock category, one thing setting them apart from most artists in these genres is that the vocalist raps on occasion. Don't let this deter you, because it's an altogether interesting and one of a kind experience. Formed in 2002, they have released two full-length albums, ""In Lake 'ch"" (2003) and ""44"" (2005). With the return of Dan Angermaier on drums, and Johnny Burke replacing Brian Scott on guitar, The Mayan Factor was moving forward with a 3rd album that they hoped to release in 2011. However, the singer Ray Schuler died on February 8th 2011  due to a heroin overdose, which put the band on indefinite hiatus.

&gt; NOW, the 3rd  album by The Mayan Factor is available. The album is called Yesterday's Son. Originally these 7 songs started off as demo's, but after Ray's passing, the band went back in and re-recorded the instrumental tracks behind Ray's vocals and guitar. With the help of Frank Marchand as engineer and producer, they have created an emotional roller coaster that serves as a beautiful final offering to themselves and the fans. Breathe it in - Yesterday's Son - and all of The Mayan Factor's music available at cdbaby,  iTunes and many other digital outlets. 

&gt; ** Update ** Because of the overwhelming love and support from our fans who share the same passion for music as we do. The Mayan Factor has decided to continue you on with this musical journey . Stay tuned for a big announcement  ***
