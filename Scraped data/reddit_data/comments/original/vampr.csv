For me personally I would not be looking at this as a ""how can I win this case in court"" situation, as that is not really the issue here.

Like others have pointed out, vampire society has rules, not because of a deep need for justice and the punishment of those who commit wrongdoing, but rather as a means of control. Diablerie is simultaneously the best meal a vampire can have, the most ecstatic pleasure they can experience, and a great way to gain power quickly. As an amoral beast, you have so many incentives to diablerise your elders. The elders, don't want this to happen, so they make it the worst crime, and punish it harshly, not because they believe in justice, but because they are self-preserving.

So. All you have to do is one, or both, of the following:

1) make sure no one ever finds out, and if someone does find out, make sure they don't reveal it, whether through influence, manipulation or force.

2) If it becomes known: make it so the powerful vampres in the areas don't care, or find it personally more beneficial to keep you alive. Can you do a great favour for the Prince? Can you get the Prince on your side? Can you perhaps manipulate or blackmail the Prince into not taking action against you?

Nothing you say in some vampire tribunal, is going to save your asses. What will save you is if the Prince or other powerful elders in the area want you alive more than they want you dead. For whatever reason.

""Daughters of Coldharbour"" is simply a term for the women who participated.

While, one supposes, men like Harkon could be called Sons of Coldharbour, there wasn't a prophecy written about them in the first era by a dickhead falmer. Whiiiich is likely where the term comes from as while Lamae Beolfag was a vampire before said dickhead was born (being the first vampire, and mother of one of the most powerful strains of vampirism second only, I'd say, to that of Bal's pureblood Vampire Lords,) there is no evidence of the term being used before then unless I missed something in my brush up research for this comment.

It's the start of a series. It has vampires and werewolves (although they're actually extraterrestrials not native to earth), but it's also got other inventive creatures/aliens. Not a lot of spice but such a supportive relationship.

{Halfway to the Grave by Jeaniene Frost}. Vampires, vampires, and more vampires. There is spice, and there is the main series with 2 stand-alone spin-offs and 2 series(3+ books each) spin-offs. Plus, she is redoing the main series in the MMCs' pov (2 books so far). There are dickwads and it's pretty violent at times so there is a bit of torture but the whole universe is very pain/gorey centric. So it might be a pass for you, but I thought I would share it because I find it to be one of the most enjoyable vampre themed universe so far.

{The King's Captive by K.M Shea} is an Elve based romance. It's the start of a trilogy and part of a bigger universe but I have not read those so I cannot attest to them.

{Magical Midlife Madness by K.F Breene} is a slow starting romance series but it's got different creatures (a few have wings), a human who inherits powers and crazy friends. Great side characters, kooky characters. Good laughs in this one for me. 

{Brimstone Bound by Helen Harper}. Again, the start of a series, slow romance, and a mystery/detective vibe. In the first book, she needs to solve 2 murders. Her new mentor... and her own. Dun dun dun!

{Death by Laura Thalassa} is thr 4th in the Four
Horseman series and he himself has wings. Definitely a enemies to lovers trope and they're pretty assholeish but they're the horseman of the apocalypse. They're not made gentle and kind.

{Gifted Theif by Helen Harper} might be a good one. I can't remember much but it's been a few years and I've only read it once. It's got Sidhe though so might fit your niche.

Asked my PA for alternatives, here they are:

For musicians who play live instruments and are interested in real-time collaboration, the most suitable platforms would be:

1. **BandLab**: This platform stands out for its real-time collaboration features. It allows musicians to create and collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world. The cloud-based DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) is user-friendly and ideal for musicians who play live instruments.
2. **Soundtrap by Spotify**: Soundtrap is particularly strong in enabling real-time music creation and collaboration. It offers a web-based DAW that's accessible and easy to use. Musicians can collaborate on projects in real-time, making it a great choice for live instrument players who want to work together remotely.
3. **Kompoz**: While not in real-time, Kompoz is designed for remote collaboration. It allows musicians to create and share tracks, contribute to others' projects, and blend live instrument recordings. It's more asynchronous but still a robust platform for collaboration.
4. **JamKazam**: Although not listed previously, JamKazam deserves a mention here. It's a platform specifically designed for playing music with others in real-time over the internet. It's ideal for musicians who want to rehearse, jam, or even perform live with others remotely.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

One advantage LA has is the average person’s appetite for live music. I’ve tried doing shows in some midwest cities and in my experience, it has been a lot easier getting people to come to the LA shows. 

Also there are TONS of open mics where you can meet new artist and potential collaborators. If youre not already doing shows, this can be a good place to start. 

There is also some solid street performing spots if youre by Santa Monica or Glendale mall area. 

I saw a comment mention you need to be assertive with your drive or something along those lines. That is 100% true. You gotta be able to come home after a long day of work and still hop in the studio for a session. You mentioned youre in your 20’s and havent made much art. If youre not already a polished artist, youre going to need incredible drive. Without a strong drive i could see how it would be easy to be in LA for years without making any progress. You just gotta keep at it, keep connecting with people, and go out alone if you have to (stay safe).

Also if youre able to now, id suggest finishing as many originals as possible to help you hit the ground running out here. 

My current plan is to finish a few more of my own originals and then im going to start renting out small venues and throwing shows. You can do a pretty solid set with just like 20 songs. And then i also plan to get some other artists on the lineup. This is one reason networking is so important. If you add another artist to your show lineup, they will bring their fans too! Im also going to start promoting the shows while im street performing and at open mics. 


If i wasnt in LA or NYC, id probably go live in Iowa or somewhere cheap af and dump tons of money into my online marketing. (Thats a whole different conversation)

If your songs are REALLY good, there is another possible option. I had two friends that saved up to buy their own studio but got discouraged by the technicality of producing/mixing. So instead they used the money to go work with some industry engineers. Their music impressed this one engineer so much he told a bunch of his network about their music and it opened some doors for them. This probably only works if your music is already reallly good


The best spot to be if money isnt an issue is probably like north/west hollywood area-ish. Its in between everything you’ll want to be going to. I live in south Redondo Beach when i first moved out here. Its only 14 miles from DTLA but thats 1 hour - 1 way. It definitely discouraged me from going into the city for open mics and going out to social events. 

If youre looking to connect w more musicians, check out VAMPR. Its a social networking app for artists but its formatted almost like tinder. You might be able to find someone to move with or once youre out here, some people to collab with.

Lmk if you have any questions!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved out to LA like a year ago for my music career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage LA has is the average person’s appetite for live music. I’ve tried doing shows in some midwest cities and in my experience, it has been a lot easier getting people to come to the LA shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there are TONS of open mics where you can meet new artist and potential collaborators. If youre not already doing shows, this can be a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some solid street performing spots if youre by Santa Monica or Glendale mall area. &lt;/p&gt;

When a character is stabbed for 20 damage, I describe how they bleed everywhere. But the game does not force them to take persistent bleeding damage until someone puts pressure on the wound, sew it up and bandage it. This doesn't bother me the slightest, as every small part of the narrative has to be represented in the rules and vice versa. Part of roleplaying is rolling with the punches and being inspired by what the rules dictate.

If you want to pick up a language, it would be good RP to 'foreshadow' this by for example mention how you are studying as the party makes camp. However, it is absolutely not required. We do not describe every small part of the characters lives, and these things are absolutely fine to infer after you've picked up the language or skill. Don't get hung up on verisimilitude, it's just creating problems for yourself.

For the Vampre Question:

Note that these archetypes have the Rare trait, so they have to be **explicitly** allowed by the GM. A good example would be during the Blood Lords Adventure Path where the PCs are in the undead ruled nation of Geb.

When the archetype becomes available, of course there will need to be some kind of narrative attached. If this is something the GM came up with or something the player and GM discussed beforehand is up to the group.

From your post, I read it that you've put the narrative on a pedestal and it's slowly been growing out of your reach (that's just my assumption and I might be wrong). There is nothing wrong with talking to your GM and letting them know ""oh, you've allowed the undead archetypes? I would like to pick up the Vampire Archetype at some points. Can we brainstorm some way this could happen?'.

A week passes until the next session. Tensions are high. How are our heroes going to find their way out of this pickle? My character is first in initiative order, he walks over to the door, closes it and puts the chains back in place, sealing the vampre in his prison.

*  Vampires have an intense dislike for moisture in their graves.  Bring a 15 pound bag of sand to spread and cover their coffins when caught unawares, then ring a silver bell, after which they are trapped inside indefinitely.  When approaching a location with multiple known Vampires and their Spawn, it is best for each individual to have at least as 4 bags apiece on the chance that not all members of such an expedition reach their final destination.

*  A vampire's thirst for blood is only surpassed by their  inability to resist fresh fruit, particularly of a red color with red juice.   A freshly prepared pomegranate is most effective in practice.  A vampire will lose all interest if blood if there is a bowl of pomegranate  berries.

*  Wolves are known to be allies of vampires, who keep them enthralled under the wolves sense of hierarchy.  To break the spell a vampire has over a wolf, approach the wolf with a calm tone of voice and hands outstretched and free of possessions, to appear larger.  Maintain eye contact with wolf while calmly calling it to you to show peaceful intention.  I've had particular success lying on the ground with a piece of freshly butchered meat tied like a medallion as it helps keep the beast's attention.  A pork chop suspended by a tendon works best.

*  Vampires and their Spawn are creatures energized by the planar extrusions from the Negative Planes, they can be considered extra-dimensional creatures.   As such, they are compelled to respond in kind to any good-faith invocation of the Universal Greeting, "" *Bah weep. Granah weep.  Ninnibong*,"" which must be said in a slow, purposeful, and most importantly, in a clear enunciation, in a call, response, and reaffirmation to be effective.  Both hands (and all other grasping appendiges) must be held up, free of weapons or other objects while the incantation is uttered.  Repeating the greeting three times renders a group of individuals impervious to harm for up two hours.

*  Vampire Spawn are known to become independent of their sires if given a magic weapon by a mortal wishing to free it from its undead master.  The transfer of the weapon is representative of the vampire spawn becoming ennobled, and therefore beknighted by it's new lord, for which it will have unending loyalty.  The more powerful the weapon, the more quickly the Spawn's loyalty will be reversed.

*  Folk tales describe running water as being anathema to Vampires.  While Vampires dislike getting their feet wet, truthfully they need to revitalize their skin at least once a day to avoid becoming excessively dry and flaking.  A Vampire that becomes submerged in water will regenerate at double it's normal rate, so be sure to engage these creatures as far from running water as possible.

*  When a Vampire or its Spawn is invited into a personal dwelling, it is bound by the rights of hospitality, and it can harm neither its host nor any other creature in occupation of said dwelling.  Furthermore, the Vampire becomes denuded of its mystical power and is as powerful (or powerless) as any common person, subject to any vulnerability that such a commoner could be susceptible.  

*  It is a common misunderstanding that a wooden stake through the heart of a vampire will instantly destroy it.  To best rid yourself of a vampire, place instead a freshly prepared beef steak, wrapped in wax paper, on a horizontal surface of waist height as near the Vampire as possible.  The Vampire will freeze in steak's presence as it reminisces upon mortal experiences and the tragic briefness of its living years.

*  Vampires destroyed in their coffins have been noted to transform into a toxic mist that has the ability to instantly invade, occupy, and even control the body of the nearest living human-like creature.  I have had this happen in more than one instance, and most highly recommend avoiding this condition.  Combat with a Vampre or its Spawn is best chanced in smaller structures with plenty of ventilation, as Vampires are well documented to have a very poor sense of direction, and the fresh air confuses their sense of smell to pinpoint living creatures.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_113x8z1,,,False,/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/113x8z1/strahd_gave_the_party_a_gift_a_book_on_vampre/j8vzghi/,public,False,t1_j8vzghi,,,[],1676628041.0,r/CurseofStrahd,0,,,,,,,vampr,,,,,,,1494390283.0,1678197805.0,,

But I agree, it always bothered me that they deal so little damage. Sure they are scary because they can charm and escape when they hit 0 hp. But if they only deal 8 damage, 8!!! with a single attack, why would you be affraid of its attacks?

Now if we compare it to something like nabassu, CR 15 (like the vampre warrior), that deals 17 damage with its claw attack and 32 with its bite (which it can use without having to grapple the target first) the vampire really looks weak.

Hell, even lower cr creatures deal better damage on average. Erinyes, CR 12; 21 per attack (it gets 3), Roc, Cr 11, 27 on average per attack. Even a Treant of cr 9 deals double the average damage of a vampire. 

Fuck it, lets go even lower on the CR scale. An air elemental, a thing made of wind, deals 6 more damage on average. That is a creature 10 (or 8) Cr lvls lower and it still hits harder.

So yea anyway, i lowered their hp by 44 and gave them +1 to AC and attack rolls and added an additional damage die to its attacks (2d8+4 instead of 1d8+4) and allow it to always make bite attacks, but at disadvantage if they dont have the target grappled, restrained or incapacitated

Untap Phase (Same as Magic)

Master Phase: This is basically like an enchantment phase. You can play 1 master per master phase. If you played a master: trifle as your first master phase, you get an additional second master phase action. [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/villein.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/villein.jpg) [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/powerbasemontreal.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/powerbasemontreal.jpg)

Minion Phase: This is where your minions (creatures) get to take actions. Note that this is before the influence phase so your recently summoned vampires will essentially have summoning sickness, but can block and react as normal. Most of the game takes place in this phase and I will break down

Influence Phase: This is where you get out your vampires through use of transfers. On the first turn of the game, the first player gets one transfer, then the second gets two and the third gets three and then caps out at four and then everybody gets four transfers for the rest of the game. A transfer means that you can move one of your pool (your life) onto your vampires in your uncontrolled region. If a vampire has an amount of blood on it to reach its capacity (number in the bottom right-hand corner). Then it flips over and becomes a controlled vampire. Transfers may be used also to take blood off of your uncontrolled vampres to put into your pool (costs 2 transfers for each blood taken) or you can spend 4 transfers and pay a pool to take the top card of your crypt and move it to your uncontrolled region. [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/dolphinblackg2.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/dolphinblackg2.jpg)

Discard Phase: Your hand size is 7 and whenever you play a card in VTES you immediately draw a card. A common problem in VTES is that your deck sometimes ‘hand jams’ with cards you can’t play or you play all of your good cards leaving in your hand too many of another card that isn’t as good. In this phase you get a free discard [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/barrensthe.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/barrensthe.jpg)

Minion Phase

1 Announce action/Action Modifier as action is announced

On your minion phase you may announce an action with a minion (one at a time). You may play an action card and announce it as your action. [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/governtheunaligned.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/governtheunaligned.jpg) This card, Govern the Unaligned has 2 modes the square version (inferior) and the diamond version (superior). If the vampire you are using has the diamond version of the discipline required for the action (in this case dominate), then they may choose which of the 2 modes of the card they will use as the action is announced. The inferior mode, which is bleed at +2 (each vampire has a base bleed of 1 so 3 total) is a directed action which only your prey can block. Bleeds by default are directed at your prey. Directed actions may be blocked only by the person being targeted. The superior mode of Govern the Unaligned is an undirected action which means firstly that the predator of the action minion may attempt to block, followed by the prey. Certain actions don’t need cards, the two main base actions in the game are bleed which is a directed action at your prey which will cause them to lose life based on the bleed total of the acting vampire, and hunt which is an undirected action which will make the acting vampire gain a blood from the blood bank.

You may also play action modifiers that say ‘Only usable as the action is announced’ as the action is declared. [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/seduction.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/seduction.jpg) This is the only window you would be able to play this card, Seduction. Reminder: You may only play one of an action modifier and reaction card each action per vampire.

2 Declare Blockers and Stealth vs Intercept

An untapped vampire (just like magic) may attempt to block an action if applicable (see previous directed/undirected actions). If stealth [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/lostincrowds.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/lostincrowds.jpg) is equal to or lower than the current intercept [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/enhancedsenses.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/enhancedsenses.jpg) total, the acting minion (the one taking the action) may play stealth cards to make the stealth of the action higher. If intercept is lower the blocking minion may play cards to increase the intercept total. If the stealth total is higher than the intercept total, the action will resolve, otherwise the action is blocked and a combat between the acting minion and blocking minion will happen.

3 Resolve Action

If the action is unblocked resolve the effects of the action. If the action is a bleed action (including an action like Govern the Unaligned at inferior), a +bleed action modifier may be played to increase the damage of the bleed [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/threats.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/threats.jpg) . A +bleed and +stealth action modifier may be played during the stealth vs intercept phase and if it was then you cannot play a second +bleed action modifier [https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/bonding.jpg](https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/bonding.jpg) .

3.1 Redirect or Reduce Bleed  
After the acting minion increases their bleed the defending play may play a bleed redirect https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/redirection.jpg or a bleed reduction card https://vdb.im/images/cards/en-EN/telepathiccounter.jpg . Bleed redirection will seem very strong (that’s because it is strong).",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_x0ysva,,,False,/r/VTES/comments/x0ysva/new_player_interested_in_checking_out_5th_edition/imhao9d/,public,False,t1_imhao9d,,,[],1661918154.0,r/VTES,0,,,,,,,vampr,,,,,,,1321510928.0,1662574031.0,,

If that all checks out, you can also ask other contacts you know in the industry who may know of this person. Definitely, a good question to ask is what do you like about my music? How did you find me? Where do you envision my music being?

One is for you to buy the Dragonslaying Aura SPell (SP costing spell) in Warrior's Tower (Travel Map &gt; East &gt; South). This token SPell gives the player a quickcast (quickcast means it doesn't use a turn to cast) 2 turn imbue that causes the player's weapon to do lesser elemental seeking against dragonkin and greater elemental seeking against dragons. Let me break that down.

An ""imbue"" is an effect that can be applied to a player that changes the element of the player's weapons for a certain amount of terms. For example, if you're using an ice weapon, but you have a light imbue, your ice weapon will do light damage until the imbue runs out. The same applies to any weapon-based skills or elemental locked skills you may have - for example, a water bloodzerker with damaged locked to water will instead do light if the player has a light imbue.

What Dragonslaying Aura does is cause your weapon's element to seek out the enemy dragon's weakest element type, and then do that damage. Lesser elemental seeking means the spell will pick the enemy's weakest element amongst the standard eight (fire, ice, water, energy, dark, light, earth, and wind). Greater elemental seeking means the imbue will seek for the enemy's weakest element against the standard eight AND harm and void. Harm and void are separate element types that some weapons/spells/skills do. Both players and monsters have ""hidden"" harm and void elemental resistances; typically, players and monsters have 100% resistance to harm and 200% resistance to void.

So, if the enemy is a dragon, dragonslayer aura will cause your weapon damage to do void damage like, 99% of the time, since enemies almost universally have 200% resistance to void. This means you can use your bloodzerker gear but have it do void damage, even when locked to the armor's element. Which is pretty fun. Basically, you can make *any weapon into a Dragon Blade.*

Also FYI, there are actually two types of ""dragons."" There are ""dragonkin"", which are related to dragons and against which dragonslaying gear triggers but is not as effective, and ""dragon,"" against which dragonslaying gear receives its full effectiveness.

Another good dragon slaying item is Dragon Blade of Nulgath from the UR ggb shop. This color custom weapon (art is originally from AQW) does lesser elemental seeking and extra damage against all dragons and dragonkins inherently. So, its basically a Dragon Blade you can have in your inventory but that doesn't do void damage. Unless, of course, you imbue it with dragonslaying aura...

Also like SoakingBearintheMoss mentioned, there's a free to play spell called ""dracomogrify."" This is a fire MP spell that if it hits, has a chance to transform normal monsters into dragonkin and dragonkin into full fledged dragons. Which means you can make ANY monster a dragon with two successful hits of dracomogrify. Which means your dragonslaying gear will do void to anything.

And finally, if you don't *just* hate dragons but also hate undead/weres/demons/vampires, there's other good trigger gear against that stuff, especially undead. You can also tag enemies as undead/weres/demons as well as dragons. I actually have an alt character whose sole focus is turning enemies into undead/dragon/were/demons and then using gear aimed at slaying those enemies against them.

if you have no friends and are in school, try asking a school music teacher if any students are making their own bands. keep bugging the music teacher so he/she remembers you.

join the school band yourself and you’ll be surrounded by musicians.

put up flyers “15 year old wants to start screamo punk band” at a music store.

there’s a lot of ways. they all involve getting off your butt and asking questions and putting yourself out there.

basically if you put yourself out there and talk to people stuff just starts to magically happen. but you have to BE out there - like consistently. If you put up one flyer at guitar center and then never try again - that’s probably not gonna work.

Kadena seems fun, and runs off of old mechanics, so it might be easier to pick up upgrades. However a lot of creature cards in this deck won’t work as well in other decks.

Lenoire is a terrible commander, but one of the others in the deck is much better. The coven mechanic is kind of slow, but there are tons of humans to upgrade the deck with.

Lathril is easy to play and upgrade, and many of the ramp elves can be used in any green deck if you make your own.

Well , here it is : i met my ex thirteen years ago in a train when i was traveling to the city of Varna ( largest seaport and  third largest city in Bulgaria and the city where my university was located ) . We hit it off pretty good . She was the first person that got me to feel good after my MS/HS sweetheart and childhood's best friend passed away from bone cancer at the age of seventeen ( in my arms , by the way ) . We talked , we exchanged Skypes ( it was a thing back then ) and numbers and had set a date ( one of many ) . We started dating and were very good match for ohe another . Or so i thought . She told me on our first date that she left her long term boyfriend recently and everything was still fresh for her . She manipulated me from the start . Turns out she never left her boyfriend . I was her side piece , her paralel relationship , her playting , her diversion ( take your pick ) . When i found out i confronted her and told her this is absolutelly unaccepible  and she should choose between me and him . She obviously choose him . And married him eventually . And this was honestly  ... THE BEST DESCISION SHE COULD'VE MAKE !!! Like seriously !!! Just 8 months after we broke up i met( or rather reconnected with , as we where from the same town and where going in the same  high school )  my now wife of six years ( together for eleven ) and mother of my children ( quintuplets , born last year ) and best friend , love of my life , basically everything i wanted in my life  from a relationship . And the contrast between her and my ex ?!? My wife is tall , blond , blue eyed , an absolute fighter , full of energy with nice , sweet and overall awesome personallity , literally shining like Galadriel from the Lord of the Rings when she enters the room (basically all things typical for an Aries woman ) . On the other hand my ex was short , weird , unhealthy looking , black hair ( very poorly maintained ) , brown eyes with unevenly placed ears , very depressed , far too sensitive ( at least she sold herself like that to me ) , with a victim complex and adept at manipulating the people around her , energy vampre as well ( i noticed back then and this stuck with me to this day that every time i was on a date with her i would return after the date feeling drained of life force and energy ) . Literally it felt like i was like dating a Black Hole . Where my wife would encouridge me to succeed and would draw my absolute best qualities to light , my ex was would do anything to bring me down ( subtelly , most of the time ) , make me feel depressed and thus be dependent on her . She was a miserable person , while my wife is full of life .  Today i am the happiest i've ever been , in my best shape ,  a husband and a father , well off financially  , having  well payed job and succesful bisness on the side . Living in my dream home , having a large farm and owning several properties in my country . I build everything together with my wife . She was next to me at every step of the way . Her charisma was my driving force . And nothing of those things would've be achievable with my ex . She wouldn't let it . She would've destroy me mentally and emotionally before allowing me the freedom to succeed . So yeah . I dodged a bullet there and i am thankfull ever since 😐",,,,,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Walking the Road | RA 12 Sister Subs'}]",False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_pcehss,,dark,False,/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/pcehss/deleted_by_user/hao7gf1/,public,False,t1_hao7gf1,,Walking the Road | RA 12 Sister Subs,[],1630151339.0,r/survivinginfidelity,0,,,,,,,vampr,,,,,,,1564039967.0,1650470983.0,,

-regularly searching Instagram by nearby location and selecting my city. I scroll through “recent” and can always spot the producers because they often take photos with gear or in clubs, etc. you’ll also learn to spot the cool moody producer portraits and find them that way, haha.

-regularly searching SoundCloud by the name of my city

-this one is a bit hit or miss as I’ve found not everyone is active, but the app Vampr is like Tinder for music collaborators. You can limit your search to distance from current location.

The cool part about Instagram location approach is I’ve also found a local graphic designer who I hired to make a logo, as well as a local studio musician with recording gear I’ve contacted about recording some instruments for me. I’m also now following a bunch of local musicians, DJs, and indie labels on Instagram which make it easier for me to see what’s happening out there.

Suggested changes for your consideration:

1. This song loops for too long without introducing anything new. Similar tune came to mind for me is ""BoxCar Racer - Elevator"" which only lasts 2:45. People will come back and re-listen if they like it.
2. You must address the pitch issues my friend. These don't hit my ears as a creative choice. Autotune has subtler settings that don't result in ""automatic t-pain"" and there are other pitch correct tools out there. Go on fiverr or vampr and chip a few shekels to somebody to correct it. If you re-track, use a piano to reference the notes you're envisioning.

But my grandfather passed away and I inherited 9 guitars, 11 keyboards, and tons of live audio equipment. So that instantly gave me a head start. I then used the money I earned from my job to buy an iMac, an interface, and a midi keyboard. Since then I’ve just been building my studio more and more. I’m also grateful to have my 2 loving parents buy the small things for me, like cables. Pretty much anything under 100$. Anything above that, they want me to pay for just because they believe that if I want this as a career, I better be willing to make the money to buy the gear I need. Although they have helped me with a couple big purchases, like the slate digital ML-1 modeling mic, and the HS-7 monitors I have. This is how I’ve built my set up over the past few years. 

To answer your question about plugins, my chain for about anything goes like this. Pro Q 3—-&gt; Virtual mix rack from slate digital——&gt; Pro Q 3. For vocals I’ll have melodyne or autotune in the chain as well. But I think the best plugin purchase I’ve made was the slate digital all access pass . It’s 15 dollars a month, you get access to SOOO much stuff. Not just the mix rack either. You get tutorials, ear tests, the Ana 2 synthesizer which is pretty much the only synth you’ll ever need IMO. You also get an amp sim, kilohearts plugins, and a few more random things. In my opinion  that’s the best purchase you could make. 

To regard my clients, I use an app called Vampr which is like tinder but for music. I also hit up random artists I see on tik tok or Instagram in hope that they’ll respond. I also think being personable with the clients you do have helps a lot too. For example, there’s this band that I discovered through tik tok, I found their insta, we started talking. It came up that I was a mix engineer, and it just so happens that they were searching for a new engineer anyway. So fast forward and I’m mixing a song for a member of the band that does some solo stuff on the side, they had some mix notes and Wanted to FaceTime to figure it out easier. So I agreed, we FaceTimed and started out going over the notes. Somehow we got sidetracked and we ended up talking for 3 hours about random things. Telling stories, talking about our favorite artists, I talked about moving to nashville, snd just random conversation. We’d fade in and out of going over the notes but it wasn’t that serious because it was only a couple notes. I believe now that me and 2 members of the band could be considered friends, and they actually live decently close to nashville and they wanted to meet up and work on some stuff in person. They’ve referred my name to a couple other artists they know about, and that relationship by itself has helped me tremendously. 

Also, I don’t really record strangers, I’m sketch about letting random people come into my home, where my family is, to record. I almost was robbed one of my first sessions and since then I only record people I know. Which, isn’t a lot, but it’s worth the peace of mind. I’ve recorded 3 different artists in my time as an engineer. They come in semi regularly. 

And one last thing I forgot, I don’t really like marketing myself towards younger artists, I do, but 99% of the time they want free work which I refuse.

I mainly say this as most of the music Facebook groups for London are indiscriminately called things like ‘London indie music scene’ and it’s impossible to tell which ones are and aren’t piss until you’re in them). Would also recommend Vampr, an app that is supposed to be Tinder for band mates. 

It’s tricky because at the moment a lot of the studios are only opening to let gigging and earning bands rehearse so just be aware of that - but also rehearsal space bulletin boards are great places to check, Arch Studios, Brixton Hill and Superunison Peckham all have thriving bulletin board culture. For a musician with as much experience as you have I would maybe recommend also checking out venues local to the music colleges to find people to jam with (thinking ICMP specifically, they used to have showcases at the Good Ship and the Balham).

It was good for posting music and getting reviews but they introduced a scheme where you had to comment and like on these number of posts to get your posts the same number traction, This in my opinion led to spam. Most of the posts if you check the platform today will have set amount of streams but the likes and comments will be much more than the number of streams. And finally after release of melofic many people told us about vampr. Personally when searching for platforms to find collaborators vampr never popped up idk why.

Bad Blood: A VamPR Nightmare

Pisces Paranormal PR Agency 

by Bee Murray &amp; Niobe Marsh

Genre: Urban Fantasy

&amp;#x200B;

Vampires are real. But whether you’re a fang-head or a groupie, there’s trouble brewing in the streets of Seattle.

&amp;#x200B;

Public meltdowns, drug overdoses, rehab missteps, mistresses coming out of the woodwork? There’s nothing a spoiled starlet or a washed up rocker could throw at the renowned Pisces PR Agency that can’t be turned into promotional gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when Tuesday Matson stepped out of her SUV on that sanguine summer evening, she didn’t expect to walk smack into the biggest PR nightmare of her career. And to make matters worse? The high-powered star at the center of it all is her ex… and they’ve got bad blood.

&amp;#x200B;

Five years ago, Vinnie Quake messed up. Big time. But that was nothing compared to this. He’s desperate for help, and if that means hiring his ex? So be it.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some secrets that can be swept under the rug, but in a city brimming with anti-vampire sentiment, how do you turn a massacre into a coming out party? There’s more to this PR emergency than Tuesday ever expected, and if she’s not careful she’ll be the next headline—and for all the wrong reasons.

Gittiği yer büyük bir şatoydu şatoya girdiğinde hiç kimse olmadığını fark etti sonra sesler durmaya başladı bu sesler bir insandan geliyor olamazdı sesin geldiği tarafa gittiğinde insan ölüleriyle karşılaştı .Sonra bir ses geldi

\- Uzun zaman oldu görüşmeyeli 

Bir anda arkasından yüzüğü koyan vampirlerden biri belirdi .Mustafa tepki veremeden saldırdı ve mustafanın kolunu çizdi ve bir anda kayboldu Mustafa ne olduğunu anlayamadan vampiri bulmaya çalıştı . vampirin gittiği yöndeki bir odaya girdi . odada 20 tane ayna vardı . sonra vampir konuşmaya başladı 

\- Ölmeden önce bir açıklama al . ben yansımalar arasında atlıyabiliyorum 

\- Bir sonraki sözün neden bana bunları anlatıyorsun 

\- NEDEN BANA BUNLARI ANLATIYORSUN . NE 

\- Ne kadar da komik 

Vampir aynalardan geçerek Mustafaya saldırmaya başlar 

Mustafa ne yapması gerektiğini düşünürken bir şey fark eder vampir ışığın geldiği yöne tam gidebiliyordu yani kendi yönüne karar veremiyordu 

Mustafa mantrasını kullanıp bir ışık kaynağı oluşturur vampir gülerek 

\- Cidden bunu yapabileceğini düşünmediğimi mi sandın 

Vampir in geçişleri aynaların yönünü deiştirerek ışığa göre şekil verir Mustafa son bir şey fark eder 

\- Bir sonraki sözün ÖL ARTIK 

\- ÖL ARTIK 

Mustafa bu aralıktan yararlanıp bir bakır para çıkarır ve vampir in geldiği yöne doğrultur vampir bakırdan gelen yansımayla havaya uçar Mustafa mantrasını kulanarak parayı atar vampir in canı yanmaya başlar ve yere düşer mustafa öldüğünü zanndik gitmeye başlarken vampir ayağala kalkar ve aynaya ışınlanır . Mustafa gülerek

\- Bunun sana yetmeyeceğini biliyordum sen düşerken aynalara mantra yoğunlaştırdım . Yanarak ölebilirsin 

Vampir acı içinde debelenerek ölür . Mustafa vampirin arta kalanlarından antidotu alır ve içer 

Ustasının yanına döndükten sonra artık geri kalan vampirleri avlamaya hazır olduğunu söyler romanın Arenalarına giderler Mustafa tek başına bir bar a gider Orda başka bir vampir gelir Vampir bağırarak 

\- Sen mi dabuu yu öldürdün 

Mustafa aynalardan geçen vampir mi diye düşünmeye başlar . sonra sadece rahatsız etmek için evet der 

\- Acı çekeceksin 

Mustafa dövüşe hazırlanırken arkadan bir figür belirir ermeni subayı geri gelmişti ermeni subayı bağırarak 

\- SENİ HAYVAN BOZMASI VARLIK 

Vampir onun kim olduğunu bilmediği için sakince 

\- Ölmenden önce git burdan 

Ermeni subayı vampir e saldırmaya başlar . Vampir basit bir şekilde yumruk atar fakat ermeni subayı tutmayı becerir 

\- Sen insan olamazsın diyip

Tekme atar ve ermeniyi ekndisinden uzaklaştırır . ermeni yüzünde deli bir bakışla bağırır 

\- ERMENİ TEKNLOJİSİ DÜNYANIN EN İYİSİDİR 

Vücudunun robot parçalarını göstermeye başlar 

\- EN SON SİZİN GİBİ MAHLUKATLARLA KARŞILAŞTIĞIMDA NERDEYSE CANIMDAN OLUYORDUM .BU SEFER SİZİN CANINIZ TEHLİKEDE 

Karın bölgesinde olan makinalı tüfekle ateş etmeye başlar . vampir sakinleğini koruyarak kolunun yan kısmından bir bıçak çıkarır ve gelen bitip kurşunları keser . gözle algılanamayacak bir hızda ermeninin arkasına geçer . Ermeni parçalara ayrılırken konuşmaya başlar 

\- Senin dövüştüğün vampir bir dhampir di . Bir melez benim gücümle yarışamaz bile .

Ermeneyi öldğrmeden önce Mustafa bir bira şişesi atar . vampir hızıyla şişeyi ikiye ayırır . Mustafa budan istifade ile çakmak atar barhane yanmaya başlar .Bir anda ateş söner vampir gülmeye başlar 

\- SEN BENİ İNSANLARLA MI KARŞILAŞTIRIYON . (gülmeye başlar) DABOO HARİÇ SENİN ŞUANA KADAR DÖVÜŞTÜKLERİN YAPILMA VAMPİR HEPSİ BENİM KANIMIN 1 DAMLASIYLA YAPILDI

Güneşin çıkmaya başladığını anlayan vampir 

\- Bu gün deilmiş 

Bir anda kaybolur 

Mustafa kafasındaki bin bir soruyla ermeniye bakar ermeni kaybından perişan bir halde sayıklıyor .iyi ölmemiş diyip ustasının yanına döner orda Ömer i de görür ustası Mustafaya ne olduğunu sorar Mustafa ustası bir şey söyleyemeden vampirlere le ilgili araştırma yapmak istediğini söyler ustası bir yer olduğunu söyler yanına Ömer de alıp mezarlığa giderler 

Mezarlıkta kend büyük babasının mezarını kazan Mustafa bir kitap bulur kitabı açınca vampirler le alakalı olduğunu anlar giderken başka bir vampir gelir 

\- O kitabı almanıza izin veremem 

Mustafa onun kim olduğunu anlar ilk zehri koyan vampir di o Mustafa dövüşmeye hazırlanırken Ömer bir adım ileri atar 

\- Sen benim babamı öldürdün acısını çekeceksin 

\- Tanrı dövüşümü kutsasın 

Mustafa vampir ile ömer in dövüşünü ne kadar görmek istesede güvenli bir yere geçip bu kitaba bakması gerekiyordu kitabı okumaya başladıkça soular ıyanıt buldu 

Vampirler bütün homsapiensler hariç bütün yaşıyan varlıklarının birleşimiydi o maske kulananı bu varlıkların bir kan damlası kadar gücünü veriyordu ve bunların hepsi yüce lord tepeshden geliyordu 

Vampirler güneşe çıkamıyordu çünkü homosapiens kanı olmadan güneş sadece onları yakıyordu bir ten bunun için insan kanı onlara daha tatlı geliyordu 

Artık ömerin nasıl gittiğine bakması gerekiyordu Ömer e bakmaya gittiğinde tek görtdüğü şey parçalanmış bir insan vücudu ve bir antidot antidotu kullandıktan sonra ağlamaya başladı gözünden yaşlarını sildikten sonra Ustasının yanına gitti bu haberi duyan ustası sinirlendi ve dediki 

\- Bu işi bitirmeye gidiyoruz 

Vampirlerin nerde olabileceğini bilen ustası onu aroma arenalarına götürür orda iki vampirle karşılaşır 

Vampirlerin onurlusu konuşmaya başlar 

\- Burda bizden başka vampirlerde var onurlu bir şekilde gelin ve duellolala çözelim 

Mustafa ve ustası kabul eder Mustafa Ömer i öldürenle dövüşecekken Ustası tepeshle dövüşecekti 

Mustafa dövüşler başlamadan önce birkaç şey aldı Mustafaya bir at verildi pekde bir şey anlamasada bindi sonra arenayı gördüğünde olanları anladı bir kolezyumdaydı ve t arabasına karşıydı ortada bir crossbow vardı yarışmaya başladılar Mustafa crossbow u aldı ve ateş etti ok çok kötü bir şekilde ıskaladı ve vampğr mustafaya yetişti Mustafa ne atından dev vampir in atlı arabasına atladı. Vampir kendi saldırısını yapmaya başladı bir anda aşırı güçlü hortumlar vampirin kollarından çıkmaya başladı fakat mustafa her türlü duruma hazırlıklı gelmişti bir ip attı vampirin kollarına ve sıkmaya başladı mantrası kolarını yaktığı gibi vampiri güçsüzleştiriyordu . Mustafa kendi atına atladı ilk tur geçmişti bile . vampir kendi gözlerini söktü ve sadece hava hareketlerinden görmeye başladı ve kafasından hava üflemeye başladı Mustafa nın atı yere devrildi ve Mustafa yere düştü .Vampir işi bitirmek için yaklaştı tam üfleyecekken arkasından ok girip geçti Vampr sonradan fark etti bunlar zaten planlıydı vampir atından alarken Mustafa mantrasıyla vampiri nbacaklarını kopardı artık Vampir hareket edemiyordu .Vampir kopmak üzere olan kolarını Mustafaya attı Mustafa nefes alamıyordu bu yüzden mantra kulanamıyordu Vampir iyi bir dövüştü derken Mustafa bir şişe ve bir bandana attı . Vampir o kadar güçlü hava çekiyorduki ne olduğunu anlayamadı o sırada Mustafa konuşmaya başladı 

\- Ömer in ölüsünden gücünün havayla ilgili bir şey olduğunu anlamıştım . bundan dolayı saf alkol ve bir çeşit kıyafet getirdim .PATLAMAYA HAZIR OL 

Vampir havayla saf alkolün etkileşiminden patlar 

\- Onurlu bir dövüştü . mekanın cennet olsun vampir orda ölür 

Ustasının dövüşüne bakmaya giderken önünü vampirler keser Mustafa önündeki vampirleri öldürerek ustasının dövüş yerine ulaşır ustası yenilmişti Tepesh ustasından bir kristal alır 

Maskesini çıkarır ve kristali maskeye takar yüzüne takar fakat hiçbir şey olmaz 

Mustafa Tepesh e saldırır tepesh ile dövüşleri sırasında tepesh konuşur 

\- Beni öldürsen bile alttaki vampirler seni öldürür 

\- EN AZINDAN SEN OLMAYACAKSIN 

İkisi nerdeyse bütün akşam boyunca dövüşürler Mustafa bitkin ir şekilde tepesh e bakar Tepesh üstünlüğü ele geçirecekken tepesh i yakan bir ışık gelir 

ERMENİ KOMUTANI BÜTÜN ORDUSUYLA ORDAYDI 

Tepesh kristalin ışığa tepki verdiğini anladı Mustafa askerlerin yanına atladı artık tepeshin ölüceğeni düşünürken bide güneş ufukta görününce kazandığını düşünmeye başladı taaki tepesh maskeyi takana kadar . maskeyi takan tepesh parıldamaya başladı vücudu sürekli deişmeye başladı en sonunda işe güneşin önüne çıkmayı becerdi .Mustafa gözlerine inanamıyordu ve kaçmaya başladı 

Tepesh arkasındna kanatlar çıkarıp Mustafayı kovalamaya başladı Mustafa Ermenilerin geldiği uçağa bindi ve kaçmayabaşladı Tepesh onu kovalıyordu Tepesh kanatlarındaki tüyleri taşlaştırıp attı taşlaşan tüyler uçağın içinde piranaya döndüler . Tepesh uçağı durdurabileceğini düşündüğü için uçağın önüne geçti .Mustafa hiç durmayıp Tepesh e çarptı ve düşmeye başladılar Mustafa bölgede bir volkan olduğunu biliyordu bundan dolayı uçağı volkana çarptırdı ve batmadan önce uçaktan atladı . öldüğünü düşünerek giderken Tepesh volkanın altından çıkarak Mustafanın koluu keser acıdan kıvranarak koluna bakan mustafa Tepesh e bakar Tepesh hiç olmadığı kadar güçlüydü hayvanların gücünden daha öte bir şeye sahipti hayvanlara dönüşebilme vampir ağzını açtı ve konuşmaya başladı 

\- Bağırışların kulağıma şarkı gibi geliyor . Acaba ne kadar bağırtabilirim seni

Mustafa Tepesh e tekme atmayı dener Fakat kendi bacağı yanmaya başlar 

\- Ben de artık nefes alabiliyorum .GÜNEŞ BENİMDE ENERJİ KAYNAĞIM

Other such shorthands would be saying that it is using FATE / Storyteller / Storypath (very similar to storyteller, but different due to licencing rules) / 2d20 / PbtA / FitD / BRP / D6 / D10 / Fuzion / D100.

So for example if someone says it s a D20-based game, that implies that it is a D&amp;D-derivate with classes and levels, and that favours certain types of gameplay. Doesn't have to be (there are other games using a s20 as core resolution mechanic, but can be for example roll low instead). So one one hand that familiarity with other such games will give you a lot of information on how it is played. However, having played a lot of D20-games you find that there are tons of differences on how the rules are implemented, so you still have to look up specifics as they tend to blend together, and very small differences can have huge implications ingame. For example how the hell does things like grapple or saving throws work in THIS game....   If they say it is a BRP-game, then you know it will be skill-based and use a D100 (roll low), and that characters will not tend to become more physically powerful.  


For the GM, it also means that they can look at an adventure for one system, and have an idea of how much they need to fiddle with it if they want to run it in a different system. For example, you do not need a complete rewrite of every npc-stats etc if you take a D&amp;D-adventure and run it in Pathfinder 1e.  Yes, it might still be a lot of work, but not as much as if you had say started with an adventure for Shadowrun or Vampre the Masquerade.  


The shorthand does not say so much about the level of crunchiness. For example Mindjammer and FATE Accelerated both uses versions of the FATE-engine. Mindjammer though is extremely crunchy here, whereas is FATE Accelerated is basically as bare-bones as you can get.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_l5ktrc,,,,/r/rpg/comments/l5ktrc/why_do_people_often_describe_rpg_systems_by/glgyuwq/,public,False,,,,[],1612092093.0,r/rpg,0,,,,,,,vampr,,,,,,,,1622492564.0,False,

Sub(How is the dub?)

So...I have literally heard the name. And something is tingling in my memory but I can't place it so I am basically full blind here. Off we go!

...Or not, the 2ndfire version of this would not play without skipping on 4 different plauers so I went back and got Cerberus. So now we are off!

And what in the nine fucking hells is this Hellstar Ramina shit? And how wasn't this on my rader WAY earlier if it has this much weird? Parasyte might actually be a fitting follow up now. Tidbit: Karusu usually means black or crow, thanks Vampre Princess Miyu! And fighting the alien monstrosity is some dude. And he wins. Getting serious RahXephon vibe off the invader, I'd be shocked if there isn't some link between the series. And it implodes, possibly taking Blacky with him. 

And we cut to somewhere completely different after a scene I am sure gets context later. I don't like how the characters are drawn here, it is hard to explain, but we get standard anime fair of the adultified child with a trainwreck parent, though this one might be working late rather than drunk. Haruka gets to school and SoL happens until we focus on the psychopath cutting his nails with a box cutter. Keep him away from the guns. Anyways, test of courage incoming and this Yuu person has changed. And holy crap these are sixth graders. And Yuu has a weird question...

And we cut again, this time to a woman with ridiculously vibrant lip stick. She is scanning for...something. And loses it. We get to Yuu's homelife and that explains some things. But raises more questions: In that picture, is that Yuu dressed like a girl with his mother or is it his mother when younger with some unknown person? Anyways, just keep isolating old Yuu, okaa-san, we will make a school shooter out of him yet! 

Jump to Haruka's homelife and indeed her mother is a train wreck, though if she is publishing said children's books that is something. Anyways, this is probably meant to evoke quiet the reaction from a Japanese audience but I've met too many useless parents to really notice. Jump cut to the DNA-dragon-WTF thing and then it is Haruka's dream. 

Haruka catches Yuu getting out of cram school. They have some connection, including a possible escape attempt. Anyways, Yuu's terrible home life seems to be obvious but he is smart enough to know he won't escape. F for Yuu. Also, glad Japan doesn't have a ton of civilian gun ownership. Haruka tries to comfort Yuu and...

Dimensional rift incoming! Color changes, Haruka gets necklace that matches the giant DNA in the sky, we get images of our opening fight and blue snow. Karusu arrives, and I am not sure how literally to take this scene, and some definite showing happens but we do need a little telling. Dragon torque sounds DND-ish to me. He does...something and the torque dissipates and he goes elsewhere. And time moves again. 

Ai and Haruka are talking, and Haruka thinks the spirit everyone is seeing is Blacky. If that's the case, good worldbuilding show. The dude from earlier shows up and makes the creepiest pitch you can imagine at 6th graders. You need to be on a list, coffee guy. Anyways, he and the woman from earlier apparently have something to do here. 

Yuu gets roped into the test of courage, we see more blue snow, his mom shows up and his balls haven't quite dropped yet so he gets to experience more hell. And then we cut to the scifi part and I sense something really bad may be in the works. Anyways, dive experiment is whatever it will become. 

Megane-chan wants to meet a ghost real bad. Yuu's mom grouses at him and it seems there is link between him and the weird shit. Haruka sees more blue snow. We get the results of the dive experiment and that seems to be a fail. Its plug gets pulled and it disappears. But apparently the rest made it through?

Anyways, the kids see someone flying towards them. Haruka very quickly determines she is the target. They have their confrontation in a graveyard and we see that matter passes through the intruder. Karasu announces that Yuu can't save Haruka because he himself could not. And he is Yuu...from the future? Probably another dimension. 

Welp, that was a first episode. I am interested but, unfortunately, I can see it playing out either way, this sort of low information run into the start is the hallmark of stories both good and terrible. The core relationship seems to be estbalished so there's that.

So let's say I have a vampire getting punched in the chest, hard. After accounting for the resistance to bashing and getting all the rolls done, Fangy takes two bashing damage and marks them down on the track.

An unlucky encounter with a fork inflicts one lethal all said and done, so that first health box is now filled with one lethal damage and the two bashing now sit on top of it. Any new bashing goes on the top and any new lethal goes on top of that first lethal and pushes all the bashing up again.

Now let's say a bad buss with a candle inflicts one Aggravated damage on our poor example vamp. The Agg goes into Fangy's -0 box and everything gets pushed up as Aggravated is the worst damage type so it always pushes the other damage types. This is important for two reasons. 

One, torpor cares about the kind of damage that pushed past the filled track. Bashing or lethal, into torpor. Aggravated, go straight to Final Death.

Two, you heal starting with the highest penalty boxes and for vampires the kind of damage determines the costs of healing. Let's be a bit worse to Fangy and say the vamp is now out of the fight with one Agg, two lethal, and four bashing. Since the Incapacitated box is filled with Bashing, Fangy is able to heal one box per blood spent. If Fangy has the generation to spend more than one blood per turn, then that's more than one box of damage healed per turn.

There's a roll that can be made to both heal and do something at the same time, but let us cut this vampre a break and say that there's no circumstances that call for this. Fangy can spend as much blood and time as is needed to heal the non-aggrivated damage. 

Aggravated is a pain to heal for vampires. It takes five blood points to heal per Aggravated and takes at least a whole day. If there's multiple Aggravated boxes to heal, that's either multiple days spent not doing much but recovering or spent willpower to heal additional boxes in a day.

This time I did a Marcurio roleplay with Erik the Slayer as a follower and simultaneously did an Erik the Slayer roleplay with Marcurio as a follower. I decided late on to do some of the main quest to bring dragons into the game, but that's when it started to not feel right. Someone on here asked if I'd killed the original Erik and Marcurio with my roleplays and that gave me an idea.

I'm currently playing a Nord female who on the orders of Ulfric and his dark brotherhood is going to kill Nilsene, see off the rest of her family (only Torbjorn remains) and inherit the Clan Shatter-Shield shipping company. Me knowing that it is not the real Nilsene makes doing the main quest and bringing dragons into the game feel right.

What also makes it work and feel right is that I'm roleplaying it as a ""conspiracy,"" so even though the game or any of the NPCs don't acknowledge what is happening, all is how it should be, because it's a conspiracy and they don't talk about it in public.

I started the story as a Stormcloak spy and went with Hadvar and joined the Legion. This was as much to get Captain Valmir to be wearing Stormcloak officer armour at the end of Siege on the Dragon Cult, but before that she did most of the Solitude/Blue Palace quests and contracted vampirism while doing the ""kill a vampire"" quest for Sybille Stentor.

She is currently making a player home of Broken Fang cave for the alchemy and enchanting and has built just a cottage at Lakeview for the smithing cooking and gardening. She's about to get the Moth priest for Harkon and hand Ulfric's war axe back to him - kicking off the civil war and vampire questlines in earnest. A Blade in the Dark and the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller are complete, but she won't be doing Diplomatic Immunity until Vittori Vici's wedding day.

The playstyle is a vampre witchblade on legendary difficulty. Currently level 50 after restarting a couple of times because of broken quests. Really enjoying this and thinking about my next roleplay which will be an imperial scholar and battlemage who actually reads the books.

Personally i like the Hammer and Amicus horror films but i also like the Shining, the Thing, Poltergeist, Black Christmas and Candyman (though when i first saw the latter it terrified me though i still watched the sequel which i haven't seen since but plan to watch at some point as i have rewatched the first film).

For me it's got to be first and foremost a good film, it doesn't have to be scary but it does have to have an element of horror as long as it's good i do not care. A good horror film can have elements of humour or be outright funny (Creepshow for the former and I Bought a Vampre Motorcycle for the latter) personally i prefer films with humour as I like a bit of light relief (The Amicus anthology films all have at least one light hearted story From Beyond the Grave is my favourite of those films though as a Doctor Who fan The House That Dripped Blood gets an honourable mention.

Candyman and Hellraiser are alright but they are relentlessly bleak the former being the worst, everything in that film is cold, dry, bleak and grey and it's more depressing than scary in places. A lighter (in colour and tone) would be just as unnerving during the film but would be easier to get over and adjust to normality.

Some films have unintentional humour in Poltergeist the psychic looks like Kim Jong-Il and i find this hilarious in the Exorcist Regen saying 'your mother sucks cocks in hell lalalala' whn impersonated sounds funny even though in the film it isn't.

So to summarise i like a film that's good, has an element of humour and doesn't leave a lasting impression apart from the feeling of contentment that you from watching a good film.Recommendations:

If you look at surveys of ""horror fiction"" like S. T. Joshi's *Unutterable Horror: A History of Supernatural Fiction* (2015), the basic elements of what scare people *haven't* changed a lot in the several thousand years where we have recorded history and literature. Which makes a lot of sense, because people themselves haven't changed much, over all - we're still subject to the same general causes of death (disease, violence, accident, old age, fire!, drowning, starvation, thirst, being stepped on by an elephant at the moment of orgasm, etc.), and pain and death remain the most visceral horrors in literature as well as real life.

What has changed over time is our individual experience of those horrors and how we communicate them. It can be really difficult for somebody today to appreciate the visceral reality of seeing your entire family succumb to the Black Plague or really experience the same sense of absolute certainty at the tortures of hell that a peasant in Europe c.1300 did. We still have the *concepts* of death by disease or eternal damnation, but the particular lived experience of growing up in a close-knit community where pestilence and hellfire made up considerable parts of your mental and spiritual life are a bit alien to us.

So too, what we think of as ""horror fiction"" took a little while to gel - there were always stories of ghosts, and elements of horror were absolutely present in many narratives that involved torture, death, supernatural peril, etc. - look at the chronicles of the Crusades, the witch trials, etc. - but in the sense of ""shudder literature"" as distinct from general fiction, that took some time to distinguish itself, and it really only came into its own in the 18th and 19th century, where it began to acquire specific forms like the Gothic novel, the *conte cruel*, the traditional English ghost story (as exemplified by M. R. James), etc.

One of the characteristics of horror fiction acquiring more literary status is that it tended to be less explicit in terms of gorey or sexual details. This isn't absolutely the case, and there was plenty of grue and exploitation in popular fiction - ""Indian captive narratives"" in the United States being a staple of dime novels with details of torture, the Grand Guignol theater in France with its often quite literal buckets of blood, etc. But Gothic novels and the like were often relatively sedate, beginning to suggest horrors and focus on atmosphere as much as bloody bones.

The ""weird tale"" and horror fiction as *genre* were more strongly solidified in the early 20th century as it pursued different paths as novels, short stories, theater, and film - the emergence of pulps like *Weird Tales* (1923-1954) created a market for horror fiction which was emulated by other magazines, and especially in the 1930s there emerged the distinct ""Weird Terror"" or ""Shudder Pulps"" - while *Weird Tales* sometimes skirted censorship laws with nude covers or the subtle hints at necrophilia, incest, or gore, pulps like *Horror Stories* and *Terror Tales* avoided the supernatural but doubled down on bloody sadomasochism, torture, and women in peril.

In part, this has to do with the specific censorship situation that existed in the United States at the time: explicit sexuality and microscopic descriptions of bloody violence could both be subject to censorship by official bodies. However, the law was more pliant when it came to ""abnormal psychology"" and sadomasochism - what we would now call kink, fetishism, or parasexual activities were seen to fall under the domain of medicine and psychology. So such works proliferated, both in horror and erotic fiction - and would eventually migrate to the new medium of comic books in the late 1930s, which would eventually receive blowback in the 1950s with the creation of the Comics Code Authority.

So too, the advent of film allowed many horrors to be *visualized* and the ""lore"" of vampires, werewolves, etc. to be ""standardized"" through films that focused on monsters that were increasingly becoming more familiar. It has to be remembered that the folklore roots of werewolves and vampires do not all share the same strengths and weaknesses as their cinematic counterparts, and films strongly influenced our familiarity with these monsters.

The history of horror in the mid-to-late 20th century is seen with both a vast diversification of horror in different media and forms, and a growing ability by writers and artists to articulate those horrors as explicitly as they wish. It is not that *Alien* (1979) was the first extraterrestrial horror story - but it was a fresh approach to a large body of work where the popular forms of extraterrestrials became more familiar and correspondingly less horrific than in previous decades. The Xenomorph was no ""little green man"" or faceless robot on a flying saucer like *The Day The Earth Stood Still* (1951).

So there's a bit of truth that you can get away with stuff today in this post-splatterpunk, post-bizarro, hardcore horror world. You can be more explicit with sex, violence, drug use, politics, etc. than in the 1930s pulps or the 1890s novels. But it's really more a matter of what horrors we are familiar with and are used to than the people in the past being easier to scare than us. There are shudder stories form the 1930s which are as nasty as anything written today, though the prose itself may be antiquated to contemporary tastes.

That is in large part why a lot of the ""classic"" horrors of yesteryear seem so sedate - it used to be folks first encountered vampires with Dracula, but nowadays folks might learn about vampires from the Count on Sesame Street or the sparkly pretty vampres of *Twilight*.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_j7gs3r,,,,/r/AskHistorians/comments/j7gs3r/bart_lisa_that_the_raven_wasnt_scary_not_even_for/g86b2ft/,public,False,,,,[],1602207849.0,r/AskHistorians,0,,,,,,,vampr,,,,,,,1377788184.0,1614309518.0,False,

There is always the... he can do it with magic, but at this time other than creating an NPC, or undead, we don't know of a way Ainz can do this.
&amp;nbsp;

Another possible exception would give if Albedo has some strange succubus magic, which lets her get pregnant. Like from bonking in a dream or something. Or some weird demon love magic, who knows.
&amp;nbsp;

Otherwise, at this time, it doesn't seem like Ainz can have children, but he doesn't need to. He already has a child (PA) who is glorious... even better than a real child.  Not only does can he turn into all the Supreme Beings parts of his personality are based on Ainz himself, far more than a physical child could be.
&amp;nbsp;

That being said, it is cool to think about what Ainz's child might look like if he somehow had a kid with someone.

Sub(The dub made my ears bleed)

So, Vampre Princess Miyu and I have a long history together. It was around my 6th anime as anime and it was follow up to Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust. Between the OVA and the TV series it hit all of my aesthetics at the time. In fact, the only time I ever cosplayed, before that word had crossed over the seas, I was Larva with a Miyu. I made great efforts to destroy all evidence that happened and I believe I succeeded but if you have a photo of a Miyu-Larva pair(red eyed Miyu) consider yourself a target for enforcement. Despite all this, and despite the TV series staying on my soundtrack to this day, I've never revisited it. So with the smack in the face the Rah rewatch was to my memories hear goes nothing. 

So the first thing one notices is the old aspect ratio does not look good on a modern monitor. And the color palette has definitely lost in panache. This can be contrasted, however, to the way I prefer the character design of this era. I also enjoy the design of the spectral forest, it feels Hellstar Ramina-esque. The soundwork is good when called for and the animation isn't bad though I can now spot the cash saving measures. And this show manages to be shoujo inspired without all the damned limbs getting funny. There are moments of action but basically the whole thing is a conversation.

As to the actual damned story, I found it creative at the time and it does work as a pseudo horror story. Things just kind of progress and the biggest question we get is whether or not it is better to be dead or undead? My answer varies but at the time I was a bit more pro-Miyu than I am now.

But the good news is that this show still matches all my aesthetics and I can feel relief from that alone.

QotD: 1 Not even the first time I saw it but I was a Forever Knight fan so I was expecting it.

2 Probably for the best because it is sadly a bit clearer the show writers aren't quite sure WHY a shinma is such a different existence from a human.

Just to reiterate what I've said on other forums about otherkin....I'm not against them (I have that reputation). By definition therians are otherkin. Not only that, but I suspect that many otherkin who say that they're not therians are, in fact, therians, because the same things that make us therian, make them otherkin. But to lump together very disparate kinds like vampres, and fae, and others is problematic.

The big problem is that we're trying to build the were community and to do that, we have questions and problems to address. If we (or researchers that are interested in helping us to answer those questions) have this huge mess of mixed peoples to try to work through, we'll never get anything done.

A lot of people in the online community don't see the need to build any sort of community or to answer any questions, but, then, a lot of people in the online community see the big problems of a therian to be ""What color is my fur,"" or ""What tail should I buy."" I strongly suspect that we're important to the mix. By our very nature, we offer the world things that have been lost over centuries of ""civilization"", things that go solidly against survival. 

Why do we try so hard to include everyone.....except humans. There is a church down the street whose mottos are ""Our race is human....our faith is unity."" They have books about yoga for dogs in their souvenir shop. I keep wondering why they stop at human. If you're going to be inclusive - include everyone.....and everything.

Wanna be special?....but not too special.

Yes, we need a world where people cooperate, but we don't have to turn everything into a quagmire to do it.

Also, I make my own beats and its far easier to meet my vision and standards if I do it myself. I put ""Don't send me beats"" in my bio and people still send out that generic ""Hey bro! Here's my YT and soundcloud"" message.

All that said, if a beat catches me I'll reach out and express interest. Then I forget about it cause I have my own beats I want to spit over lol. It happens, I get distracted. Also, I've been ghosted by a producer before even when I had a 16 ready to go. 

Like everyone here has said, its mainly the problem of work ethic and attitude. Most people are lazy or are afraid of the work. In my case, I prioritised my own work over someone else's.
