hopes. Very very disappointed: I set it to global. Swiped on about 5 people, messaged them about their music and it says that they responded but there are no messages. Turns out people just share music that they didn\u2019t even produce\/write\/mix\/master Then the app crashes when I try to save my bio after editing. And then it says it\u2019s loading and trying to discover and it\u2019s been doing that for 2 days. Haven\u2019t seen anybody else pop up on the app, even after I set my preferences every which was. Relaunched app. Hard reset my phone. Nothing. Too many bugs. I\u2019ve got music to write, can\u2019t waste my time on troubleshooting. If this gets fixed I\u2019ll try it again. iPhone 7 Verizon. Sorry guys.","1":"Does nothing for normal everyday people.: This app does nothing for regular people trying to find others at their level. I\u2019m very busy at work and have very limited time and equipment and I\u2019m just looking for some every day diamonds in the rough who don\u2019t work in big studios, don\u2019t have a silver spoon in their mouth, and have a compatible style to my own. I\u2019d like the app to give the option to list and search skill level.\nAlso I didn\u2019t sign up in the app to waste my time worshiping famous and well known bands. This app is supposed to be for us underdog unpopular musicians to find others like us. I shouldn\u2019t have to be forced to list those famous bands and have my news feed be littered with news about them. I don\u2019t go to band classifieds to hear popular band news, that\u2019s what a Google search is for.\nThis app does nothing for the little guy. I\u2019ve been patiently searching for like a year for any semblance of normal everyday diverse people who like to tinker with music programs, experiment with the instruments instead of always relying on samples, aren\u2019t perfect at mixing and polishing, and just want to make art without being obsessed with sounding like some pretentious snooty popular band or same old watered down modern rap sound powered by a major label. WHERE ARE ALL THE NORMAL UNDERDOGS!? Very frustrating experience.","2":"Bad execution: This app is a great idea and as a musician I was really excited to start finding people to potentially collab with. Unfortunately it falls under the category of social media apps where it\u2019s so uncommon to actually get a response that when you do it\u2019s already incredibly lucky, and then you have to hope that they\u2019re near you, or like what you like, or don\u2019t ghost you after responding to your first message. It just makes it extremely difficult and that\u2019s not necessarily the apps fault but idk. I haven\u2019t had many problems but I\u2019ve seen people say it\u2019s extremely buggy and glitchy and I do notice that every time I open the app. I personally have not had any luck meeting people and trying to collab because they never answer me \ud83d\ude02 all in all I love the idea they were going for but there are things to fix.","3":"Good concept but\u2026: The issues that I can\u2019t get past are\n- swiping for a band member makes the process more difficult to find the right applicants\n- The app has a ton of bugs like, I can\u2019t update my instagram to my more recent posts and links on peoples profiles don\u2019t work\n- The design needs some work, because profiles aren\u2019t set up to show there work. It\u2019s more to give you visuals of their persona which is cool, but doesn\u2019t show people what they can \u201cbring to the table\u201d. \n- my final point is that if the app wouldn\u2019t make people pay for extra features, it would be easier for musicians to connect. It\u2019s hard enough to connect for musicians as it is (not to mention that searching musicians usually have a lesser income), and the app claims to be for musicians, but it seems it\u2019s just another money hungry dating app.","4":"Not what musicians want: Disappointed to leave this a bad review, because the app is a great idea.  Making this like a dating up with \u201cswiping\u201d is a fundamentally stupid idea.  If you move to the next profile you can no longer see the previous profile unless you engaged with it via a follow\/request.  This puts too much pressure on the end user to just browse and see who is on the app.  This should function like a catalog of available musicians that can simply be searched without any nonsense.  The idea of selling \u201cunswipes\u201d or whatever it\u2019s called is the Achilles heel of the current design.  You\u2019re actually monetizing a UX flaw?  Just sell adds.  This is an immediate delete from my side and I assure you, musicians are NOT looking for another dating app.  This should actually be useful, or it\u2019s a waste of time.","5":"Great concept, mediocre execution: I\u2019ve been using Vampr since close to launch. It\u2019s a really great concept, and I\u2019ve met a couple cool locals with it. However it is unbelievably clunky to use. They now seem very focused on monetizing and adding new features, but the basic features (swipe, view profiles, messaging) don\u2019t even work all that well. Hoping that the additional features keep them going but wish they would focus on making it more functional. I won\u2019t even consider paying for the premium\/extra swipes with how awkward the app is to use.","6":"Works great have collabed: I\u2019ve already collaborated several times with people and there are some talented people on here but there\u2019s also a lot of people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and claim that they do. There\u2019s still always going to be people posting terrible music that they only just started making and those guys that never practice expecting the world from everyone else. In spite of that it\u2019s a really useful tool for those of us actually committed to the craft and trying to meet up with others or collaborate.","7":"Like the idea but the apps still has a lot of bugs: I started using the app verified my email and I spent one night swiping and connecting with people. The next morning I look at the app icon and the notification badge says I have 68 notifications, I open the app to check it and from that point on I was unable to select anything on the screen and I get stuck on the \u201cWe are currently searching for potential contacts\u201d page. I\u2019ve tried uninstalling and refreshing the app multiple times but I still have the same issue every time. I just thought I\u2019d leave this review to help you guys spot more bugs because I hadn\u2019t seen anyone with the exact same problem as me. Definitely have a good idea here but the app is going to need some work.","8":"Everything you want it to be: At this point, it\u2019s up to you to make the most of it. If I had one thing I wish they added as a feature, it would be having a religious\/political filter, as that could strengthen the already strong connections even more so. I am a Christian, and would love to meet other Christian musicians to start a band, so that\u2019s why I mention that feature\u2014it\u2019s relevant to me. Other than that, the app does literally everything it can to provide a sleek yet detailed method to pursuing musical fellowship.","9":"In my city it works: I have linked with a good number of musicians through this app and I have met up and had success making music with a handful or so. Idk what else to say other than it\u2019s working for me. There could be a few improvements to the app in regards to discovery preference settings and maybe no allowing every single guitar player to put they\u2019re a bass player, kinda muddies search results. Maybe the ability to select a main instrument. But all in all I\u2019m happy with the app.","10":"All of the social medias mixed together: So I was thinking one day how it would be cool to have like a app that was like how a dating app works but instead of dates you link up and jam with people when you\u2019re in need of a musician , when a drummer canceled on a gig I was trying to text everyone I know and I ran out of people then I found vampr and I was able to find multiple people who I\u2019ve jammed with and became friends with so I\u2019d say y\u2019all did a good job with this app thank you !","11":"Good concept but too buggy: The idea for this app is great, but the engineering is poor quality because it\u2019s very slow and filled with bugs. I often have to tap a button 5 times before it goes through. The most important feature on this app- uploading a sample of your original music for others to hear- rarely works at all. Not sure how you\u2019re supposed to connect with other musicians if you can\u2019t hear how they play. There\u2019s a lot of newbies on here and no one wants to waste their time connecting with a musician who is not around their level. Please fix the slowness and all the bugs!","12":"Test Your App Before Releasing It!: The premise of this app is simple: connect with other artists. However, the way this app goes about it is awful. Messaging is a joke. I have notifications disabled and yet I\u2019m still getting them. You cannot clear your connections. I unfriended someone and an hour late the app kept telling me I had a new connection and it  was that same person. I even went so far as to block them and quit the app. Reopened it and again, new connection. Ridiculous!\n\nI had the number 45 stuck as my app badge because I had 45 connections even though I had 7 new messages. The only way to check new messages is to force quit the app and hope you have a notification in your notification pull down of that message. Otherwise it is GONE. You can open a text thread and messages you once received are gone as well as a message you may have sent. Unreal!\n\nHonestly this is the worst networking app I have used in my entire life. How was this even released? Did no one test this?\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed this app is in my download history.","13":"Must have for those looking to start a band!: I live in Los Angeles. And though there are tons of talented and motivated musicians out here, it\u2019s hard to find and connect with them because LA is such a big place. This app is a must for those who are looking to collaborate, start new bands, find fill in players etc. The UI is excellent and building your profile and contacting one another is extremely straight forward. Try it out for yourself!","14":"Still new but Im already connecting with Audio minded people: So far I\u2019ve only explored the LA region, but I have already gotten in touch with a few different Artists,  Singers , Engineers and Music Lovers within a few weeks. The app GUI is very smooth (can still use some improvements) and manageable for a newer app. I say, give it a shot and check out the community around you!","15":"Promising idea but buggy: Great idea trying to fill the very real demand of connecting musicians. Will keep using it for that.\n\nUnfortunately the app itself crashes constantly, doesn\u2019t load messages, sends every notification to your email without a way to turn that off (without disabling all notifications).\n\nAlso feels a little too much like tinder. The \u201cgamification\u201d of auditioning musicians feels weird. Idk what the solution is but it takes time to listen to people\u2019s music, you can\u2019t just mindlessly swipe. So tone down that aspect a bit.","16":"Great in Theory; Questionable Execution: I don\u2019t really understand the whole connections thing.. is it like Tinder where we both swipe on each other to match? Do they know if I swipe on them, and if so how do I check to see who\u2019s swiped on me? Also why do none of the connection notifications go away? I love it and I think it had the potential (and developers) to be an AWESOME app, but it has a few kinks. Overall it\u2019s fun and I\u2019d recommend it to a friend- I hope to see it evolve into something a little more \u201cconsumer friendly\u201d, I know it definitely has the ability to be totally sick.","17":"Great concept. Rough execution.: I had a really high hopes for this application. When I first started learning programming, this was one of the ideas I had in my head. I\u2019m sorry to say that dream is still alive because this app is a bug fest. The latest updates have made it basically impossible for me to even continue the pro trial because the app won\u2019t load. When it does load, it does a pretty bad job of aggregating what you listen to as promotion for your profile. Somehow artist I haven\u2019t listened to in years were coming up as some of my favorites being featured to others.\n\nI\u2019ll revisit it next quarter with an updated review. Fingers crossed! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e","18":"People are coming for having fun not for making music: Vampr, you\u2019re app is being misused by many people. I\u2019m not getting a proper artist from your app now.\nI suggest you should only accept people who have produced their own songs & make it mandatory for all the producers to post on their profile or remove their profiles.\nMany people do not post on their profiles and are pretending to be artists.\nI think you should start making some ground rules for your app before allowing people into it.","19":"Good Concept, but response rate is low: The app has a great concept however the the response rate is very low whenever you try to connect with someone.  It would be great if users were more involved or checked the app.  It might be a good idea to deactivate inactive accounts to purge through people who don\u2019t use the app anymore.  Or set a limit to say \u201cif you haven\u2019t used your account in a certain amount of days your account will be deactivated\u201d.  Something to help users get connected with the people who are actually on the app to network.","20":"Great app, but has some glitches: I\u2019ve found 4 band members through this app who were all great musicians! That being said, it does have its glitches. Most of the time it filters correctly but sometimes it will give you someone a year or two out of your age range, or in a different country when you chose local. But it does have some quality musicians if you\u2019re patient.","21":"Solid app and getting better: If you\u2019re looking to connect with other artists to do business with and connect with, I would highly recommend this app. Sure some people don\u2019t respond even after messaging you first but you end up making good connections with people that are on here for the right reasons. To connect and progress in their own music","22":"Chat needs work: The app is great! Everything works pretty smoothly and I love the concept. However, since I\u2019ve been using the app I noticed a problem with the instant chat. Every time I send a message it fails to sends. I just tried sending a message and it failed twice before it went through. It may get annoying for someone sending a long message. Please fix.","23":"Designed for success minded people.: Nothing to complain about but I\u2019ve only had the app for a short while. Would like to see a few more free swipes, but since they let you connect other ways it\u2019s all good. \n\nThey have a good layout and several stellar options for learning and promoting. Definitely useful to people wanting to treat their music as a job!","24":"Amazing networking opportunity for all types of Artist: Downloaded the app last week and already made tons of connections with other artist from all around the world in just minutes. The app is super dope and I recommend for anyone who\u2019s trying to get their send out there and mix and mingle with fellow creatives. You never know who you might meet!","25":"Really Good! Can be better though!: I can\u2019t really complain about the app- it\u2019s really good. \nSome things for the devs to consider for future updates:\n-The My Shoutout Character Length needs to be a hair longer. Exaggerated but \u201cLooking to collab!\u201d Is a bit general shoutout before you have 5 char left.\n-Miles for distance would be appreciated!\n-A big thing here\u2026. Search settings don\u2019t seem to apply, and if you aren\u2019t getting unlimited swipes (whether you don\u2019t want to pay for it\/can\u2019t afford it at the moment). It is wasted time. (And wasted limited Swipes!)\n-App currently seems to have a whiteout after a minute? Don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on there.\n\nBut overall, really good!","26":"My experience\u2026.: When signing up I was asked about my \u201cExperience\u201d as a musician the following questions pertained to my social media influence and the most number to streams on a reaped track. I believe none of this has to do with the 8 years of experience I have working with teachers or the things that really matter when it comes to progress. Social media influence isn\u2019t everything and can even be deceiving at times. I\u2019m not here to find people to use for their following.","27":"Best app for Musicians looking for a band mates.: I have only use the app for 30 min total and already have three messages from artist in my area looking to link up and play the styles I like. I didn\u2019t expect much but Im super exited there is an opportunity to meet new musicians and get to work making music and playing shows. Awesome idea and it works.","28":"Terribly executed app: It has so much promise. Even the profile set up is pretty good. But there are so many problems with it. When you receive a suggested contact you have to swipe it away to see the next. But you can\u2019t go back far without paying a lot. How does one decide instantly that this is one person is someone I must connect with? I also dislike getting random connection requests from around the world from people who have nothing in common with me. This app is a social media nightmare. So disappointing.","29":"Good app: It\u2019s awesome concept I feel there should be a few things to switch for example here\u2019s free game \nIt be easier to swipe left or right if when the profile pops up music clips should already play without going into the account makes it so much faster to connect to whom you need or want to work with","30":"It\u2019s pretty good tbh\u2026: It\u2019s pretty decent so far, I\u2019ve connected with a couple people but I\u2019ve only been on it for about two days. I think it\u2019s pretty cool to be able to connect with a lot of different kinds of people who do a lot of different things. Also it\u2019s pretty easy to use that\u2019s what we all love of course lol.","31":"Pretty good, but there\u2019s always room for improvement: Ok so I\u2019ve had this app for about a month now, I enjoy it but due to my location it is hard to find band mates, I completely understand that. I live in rural Connecticut for gods sake. I wish this app had more of an audience. So people like me can find people to jam with. Other than that the app runs smoothly and I haven\u2019t experienced any tech issues like some of the other reviews claim they\u2019ve had. Keep up the good work!","32":"Great concept, but super buggy: I love this concept but if you purchase pro, be warned: the search by \u201cdifferent city\u201d function doesn\u2019t function. Whatever you select, it will still reset to local. I travel a lot so this makes it virtually unusable to find collaborators in the area I actually live. Deleted, re-downloaded, same results. Will update when this feature is corrected.","33":"When it works it\u2019s ok at best: Used the app then went to open it back up and now asks me to sign in with my email or with Facebook, I opt for email. Put in my email, it then sends me an email to verify my address, even though I\u2019m already a member.  I click on link in email and it confirms me again and then directs me back to the app, I open it and am again told to input an email or Facebook to log in, I do so, and it again wants me to verify my email address. \nJust a repetitive circle and can never log back in even though I\u2019ve been a user of the app for awhile now.","34":"Good idea, really poor execution: I really do like the concept here, but this app is so buggy all over the place it makes it hard to justify spending time on. A few examples:\nMany text fields are coded in such a way that if you press backspace too many times it will refill the field with the text that was originally there. \nI could not find a way to change my primary skill. \nNot a single piece of audio played for me at all. \nI have a pretty new iPhone 14 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","35":"Cool and easy way to find connections.: Usually for an app nearly as good as this I\u2019d have to go through loops and subscribe to a monthly membership to have some of the basic perks this site offers out the gate. I may even pay for a membership because of that. Great marketing!","36":"Great Idea, App Needs Work: I didn\u2019t check to see how new this app is, but I absolutely love the concept and I\u2019ve been able to connect with some like-minded people in my area. Love it! The app is still a bit buggy and I can see they\u2019re working on a lot all at once, so I\u2019m sure this app is going to get much more polished in the future, until then I\u2019ll enjoy getting to meet new music lovers like me!","37":"App freezes: Have had the app for a week now and any time you try and change your discovery preferences the app will freeze. Try and change the age range or the distance and it freezes. I\u2019d much rather the app force close than to just freeze the touchscreen and not respond\n\nI just noticed in reading previous reviews others have had this problem but the developers don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m glad I decided to try it out before  buying the \"pro\" option","38":"Oops: It\u2019s a great app, but I accidentally said no to like everyone in my area and I can\u2019t restart. I made the mistake. It\u2019s four stars because because, while there is a back button, there\u2019s no way to go back through to those people again. I was really hoping to start another band, but, like I said, I messed it up\u2026","39":"They automatically \u201cassumed\u201d my dating preference\ud83e\udd28: I\u2019m like 10 mins trying to setup my profile and the app just keeps asking all of this personal info trying to get my IG, address info, etc. then afterwards after I finally set everything up. When I first started swiping I noticed that it was nothing but dudes...\ud83e\udd28now I\u2019m not against LBGT or anything but c\u2019mon man, at least ASK what I\u2019m lookin for 1ST then give me options. I had to manually change that in the settings.. it was saved as \u201cANY\u201d\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","40":"Solid Idea Revived and Redesigned: When I originally used Vampr, I was hopeful but I didn\u2019t have a lot of variety to choose from. Now it\u2019s much easier to connect with other artists with the same interests or similar ones. The pro perks are worth it as well. Very, very, worth it.","41":"Great concept, needs A LOT of improvement.: Your app is still very buggy. Some things you should consider:\nInclude a swipe left feature on messages to access a delete\/mute button on connections that have been made.\n\u201cContact Us\u201d button does not work.\nThe ability to ignore\/deny\/approve connections (there are too many for me to go through).\nUsers should be required to send a message first before any connection is officially made. If someone is interested, they should be making the first move.\n\u201cSeen messages\u201d are not being registered when they have been opened and is very annoying to see a badge on the app on my home screen. \n\nThis app has a lot of potential, but it isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll use until it\u2019s been optimized and these bugs are fixed. I\u2019d love to be notified in the future if things are improved.","42":"Awesome App: The concept alone if the app is what\u2019s genius but its actually really simple and it still lets you connect with people if you like the free option ofc but it is a new app on the map so i\u2019m sure there are updates to come but so far no issues for me.","43":"Great App: Love the app I think there should be some battles and tournaments fkr some prize money too.. possibly get some bigger names to promote the product more. Maybe fill out a form of likes and dislikes so people are more aligned to have the same vision or sound when collaborating","44":"FIRST MATCH BOUT TO SEE HOW IT GO\ud83d\udd25: A lot of slow traffic, but once you get that first slide into the dm you already know it\u2019s someone messing with you so they want the work want to put in the time and maneee imma just have to update ya knowing imma about to blow up with some new artist producers anything you need this the spot for it \ud83c\udfb6 let\u2019s go do it \ud83d\udd25","45":"Pretty Good: Just started a couple days ago and have already found a drummer for my band. Only issue is they want you to pay for their \u201cplus\u201d membership if you want to have the ability to undo a swipe.","46":"It does what it says it does \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb: The app works quite well. If you are serious about meeting other musicians, it introduces you to many of them. Simply swipe left or right! Just like a good match making site, but for band mates. It actually works.","47":"Really good app: Definitely recommend this app if you\u2019re looking to connect with musicians from your own hometown to around the world. I\u2019ve met lots of great connections from booking shows to band members and even crazier my girlfriend of two years \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc","48":"Nice app but stalls when searching: I downloaded this app a few days ago and started using it to make connections. I have adjusted my criteria for people I want to connect with but sometimes after I do that I get a message that says it is searching and continues to display that for minutes or until I stop the search. The search seems very slow or unresponsive sometimes.","49":"Cool idea- too money hungry though: I like the idea of being able to connect with other musicians, but they aren\u2019t suggesting people within my selected genre of music, and I did set the search criteria properly. Not only that, but you\u2019re limited in how many profiles you can LOOK at per day unless you pay them money, which is absolutely ridiculous. Find another way to line your pockets ya money grubbers!","50":"Not a lot of collaboration: I got the app a few months back and I have made \u201c connections\u201d but nothing has come to fruition. There was this one lady who thought this was a dating app.\ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23 I mean it\u2019s probably equally as useful as one. 3 stars on the potential because I see where this app could go. If it goes where I think it could go easily 5 stars.","51":"Needs: This needs a solid looking for section so when that need is fulfilled you can track the progress of that musician or band great for metrics and improving your services but other than that great app","52":"OMG user experience: If user cannot enter date of birth (keeps holding today so I could enter date so came whatever spins back from app so I had to hide my age on registration to pass the step) and could not skip photo for background and panorama nonsense\u2026 so could not register at all. imagine how the rest of app works. I did not get that far. I have tried to communicate developer but  there is no contact to send email even on their website.","53":"Not enough swipes in a day.: Not enough serious musicians that actually want to play. More like a swiping dating app. Would like to see more music uploading options and not have to connect to social media.","54":"Cool but...: It's a pretty cool app. Love the Neomorphism theme, but there are alot of bugs crawling around. I have to relog into my soundcloud every time I want to add songs, if something is already playing the app doesn't stop when you play something else it just plays over it. This could be great but right now I'm just browsing to see where it goes. \n\nWould love it if I could rearrange tracks on my profile!","55":"One of a Kind App: This app is what I\u2019ve looked for for a long time. I recently moved and am looking to create a band then eventually find a crew to open a studio with. This app just opened that door in a way that didn\u2019t previously exist!","56":"Legit: Musicians, this is a good and legit ap. It\u2019s easy to make real connections and seems to be full of serious musicians. For not yet rich musicians the free version works well, gets to the point of connecting or not and then the rest is up to you! Good luck!","57":"A very frustrating bug: I love the app, it\u2019s great. But every time I send a connection request, the keyboard covers over half the screen and it doesn\u2019t allow me to see what I\u2019m typing in my request. So I have to type out my whole message then close the keyboard to see what I wrote, then do it all over again if there\u2019s typos or if I want to re word something. Very frustrating","58":"Cool concept if it actually worked: The app is an awesome idea although it\u2019s super buggy and hardly ever works in discovery mode. After the last update my whole account was basically deleted and I lost all the ppl I matched with and my information that was saved. Also, I feel like everyone I like I match with and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a coincidence or if they just have it set up that way but it defeats the purpose. Very disappointed there\u2019s many fixes that need to be made","59":"Disappointing: First off, it\u2019s disappointing how hard it is to actually find people in your area with similar musical interests. Second, when I do find someone I\u2019m interested in, I can\u2019t even see their profile because the app glitches and gets stuck on the same (previous) profile.\n\nIt shows how little care went into this project. What a shame. I wouldn\u2019t waste too much time or money on here.","60":"So far so good: Digging what this app has to offer so far. First & foremost seems to be pretty user friendly which displays to be  a good sign.  Already networking with serious minded individual. Signed up for the publishing service so we\u2019ll see what it do.   Peace \u262e\ufe0f #trematicmusic","61":"This app needs updating desperately: I love connecting with musicians, but unfortunately this app has been making it hard to do that. There are way too many bugs and glitches, I can\u2019t even post content. All my friends who use this app have the same problem. Buying the plan is 100% not worth the money until they have fixed a lot of issues, I have wasted my money.","62":"Great Networking tool: I use this in conjunction with Instagram to find artist to work with for my production business. I really love that you can listen to an artist music and everything right in the app. So clutch for growing my business.","63":"Disappointed: Just don\u2019t understand in order to put my links to my other social media accounts it wants full access to my accounts. In my eyes just seems a little sus considering one day you blow up. Other then that this would be a great app for artist in your area to connect! Just don\u2019t trust company\u2019s knowing any of my my sensitive information.","64":"Love this app: Has all the right features i could imagine and is organized. I\u2019ve made connections in less than 25 hours of downloading and creating an account. Great job","65":"Awesome app: I've only had this app for a couple days but have already met all kinds of musicians in my area. I\u2019ve been looking for an app like this for a long time and finally one came along!","66":"Great Idea: I think it\u2019s an awesome app and a great idea on how to connect artists and other walks of the music world to each other! Would recommend to anyone looking to give or get support and build connections!","67":"Loving that app: All together, I just want to say how impressed I am with the staff and how amazing they seem. This group seems to be working so hard and the fact that there are responses to reviews is a step in all the right directions. Glad to find this.\nJoshua Matthews","68":"Solid: Great for promoting your content & making connections. If you\u2019re an artist with a small following looking to grow, download Vampr. You\u2019re not going to become Travis Scott overnight but it will definitely extend your catalogue!","69":"Great idea, but\u2026..: this thing glitches way too much. Particularly when I edit my profile. Pictures get reverted back, my vamps won\u2019t upload, anything I change will get reverted back to previous, it freezes often, yada yada yada. Great idea for an app though. I wish I could use it better.","70":"I love this: I never thought an app like this existed. I was on Bumble business to find music producers to collaborate as a singer but I couldn\u2019t find any. Upon seeing an ad on Instagram of Vampr I thought I should give this a shot","71":"I can\u2019t even make an account: This app doesn\u2019t work at all. I can\u2019t even select 5 artists to be able to even make an account. It only lets me select 1, and it won\u2019t let me add anything else. Also, when I tried to select my birthdate, the result was telling me the entire wrong date. I even deleted it and tried again like 4 times and it still didn\u2019t work. This is garbage.","72":"Vampr is super cool but !!: You can\u2019t just follow somebody without having to make some kind of commitment you know in that moment you got a wait for the request back and then all this other stuff if they would just change it to where you could just follow people simply and then not everything is a commitment in the moment.","73":"Property good, suggestions tho: Please make an \u201cundo\u201d button. I can\u2019t Tell you how many times I\u2019ve accidentally swiped the wrong direction or under intentionally canceled the potential for conversation So I\u2019d like it if you either create an undo button or change the layout","74":"Um...what?: Okay what a great idea right! It\u2019s still kinda a small app so I had a hard time finding people near me, honestly wish I could choose a state instead of miles.\nBut you want to CHARGE ME FOR SWIPES? How the actual heck does that make any sense. I know y\u2019all gotta make money but find a different way cause thats Ludacris! I think I\u2019m gonna delete it. But the app has so much potential\ud83e\udd19","75":"Changing the game: Yo I can\u2019t even explain how beneficial this app is \u2026.not because I\u2019m lost for words \u2026. But because I\u2019m too busy enjoying the app and I don\u2019t have time to tell you how good it is soooo,catch me in the app \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","76":"Very nice app, but the messages are still not working: I started using this app not long ago and I\u2019ve messaged some people, it shows me the notification that some of them answered, however when I try to see there\u2019s nothing written. I can\u2019t see their messages. This is really bothering. If you fix it I will rate it higher.","77":"Every musician should have this app: Great way to meet other musicians. Thoughtful design that allows you to showcase your work and tag genres you\u2019re interested in.","78":"DUDE: How am I just finding out about this app? Seriously great so far. Be patient with it but you can really connect with some awesome musical talent. Just moved into a new area and this is helping my break into the scene. Thanks Vampr!","79":"App is underdeveloped: I can\u2019t really comment on the platform because I can\u2019t get past the 4 digit verification. I\u2019ve tried several times. Also tried to log in through Facebook and get critical errors. I mentioned this on their Facebook page and they offered no support. However, judging from the reviews I wouldn\u2019t waste my time even downloading it. There are Facebook groups that offer the same advantages.","80":"Pretty great app: A good app for the most part, you don\u2019t have limited texts which is fantastic. You\u2019d be choosing to pay for promoting your music or learning (academy) which is fairly cheap. Overall though, a solid app","81":"paywalls: limiting how many people you can swipe through per day really just makes this app nearly useless for me. the whole point of the app is to find musicians, but it\u2019s quite annoying when to actually use the core feature of the app effectively you need to pay. of course you can just wait till tomorrow, but it\u2019s irritating when you have to wait a whole 24 hours just so you can swipe left on ppl you aren\u2019t interested in. it\u2019s a shame because i thought it was pretty neat before i was confronted with the \u201cyou\u2019ve hit the daily swipe limit\u201d message.","82":"Appears to be a very well built app.: This is my first day using this app. So far, everything seems to be very well thought out and accommodating.","83":"loading\u2026: It\u2019d be a nice app if I didn\u2019t spend 5-10 mins loading chat rooms or just people in general. Great potential but I don\u2019t think anyone has time to stare at loading icons when they could be networking. Reset my phone, wifi works fine, cellular works fine, just a really slow experience.","84":"Seems to actually do what it says: The app seems to actually do what it says, and that\u2019s\u2026 despite an apparently astonishingly low bar, very refreshing.","85":"Had a problem, developer helped me fix it.: Updating my review. Can change profile pictures in the app when previously linked to Facebook.","86":"To my surprise it actually works.: I moved from San Francisco to LA with out knowing anyone. I was able to find 4 people to jam with in one day. I hope this app becomes more mainstream","87":"Great app and Potential: This app is a really clever idea and has a great concept. Currently, I know some actually cool artists. Only thing I will say is be aware and cautious of scammers. It\u2019s sad to say but their are people out here phishing with your dreams. \nStay safe & good luck!\ud83e\udd1d\n~Peakplzzz","88":"Curious! I have a feeling that this may work!: Always curious to see where I can meet quality musicians and other professionals in the industry. This may be it!","89":"Simple and useful: I\u2019ve been looking to start a band and less than 20 minutes I already have a prospect","90":"Love it.: I wish the Instagram layout on vampr was by post and not pictures. If you have an Instagram post with multiple pictures it displays on vampr as a post for each picture.","91":"So far so good!: Great to connect with other musicians and artists. I\u2019ve only been using the app for a few days but so far so good! I enjoy all the features!","92":"I\u2019ve been looking for something like this!: There are definitely a couple bugs that need to be ironed out, but overall the app functions well and looks good.","93":"Please bring back the mutual artist names: So, the latest update changed the favorite artist into these tiny circles and it\u2019s impossible to tell who a band is. We need to see the names to know what band someone is into, tiny circles show nothing, making this feature useless","94":"Once more people join, it will work better: The format is familiar. Easy to use. It\u2019s like tinder for musicians, but not as many options, yet.","95":"Great networking platform!: It familiar yet unique! \nSuper easy to use, already talking to other musicians all over the world! \n\nCan\u2019t wait to see where this goes!","96":"Just what I needed: This is Just what I needed as an up and coming recording studio in Sac. A way to easily discover talented people in or around my area. Let the work begin can\u2019t wait to have testimonials at the Grammys!","97":"Experience so far: It\u2019s a pretty fun app just having fun with it meeting new people trying to find a band to sing in and it seems like a really awesome community","98":"Great (but flawed): I think the app is great- but maybe needs a bit of time to grow. There weren\u2019t very many musicians in my area that I had some interest in\u2026 Also, I can\u2019t seem to post any vamps- I press the finish button and it just loads endlessly.","99":"hard to figure out: tried the app but found it to be of very little discovery value. The UI isn't intuitive and I was constantly receiving emails for offers I couldn't even find when logging into the app. just one person's opinion, but it was far harder to use Vampr than Facebook groups or Craig's List for meeting up with local musicians","100":"Vampr: Vampr is solid. I would recommend it mostly for bands looking to fill in the last slot they need. Much harder to get responses as a solo musician but it is possible if you keep at it. Overall, it\u2019s a good resource.","101":"Highly Disappointed: A lot of bugs. But that wasn\u2019t the worst. It completely deleted my profile!! I had 100s of connections. Even when I tried to log back in with the email I\u2019ve been using it prompted me to create an entirely new profile. When you guys get an app that works contact me. \ud83d\ude24\n\n\ud83d\ude02 Josh you mad? Let me give you some advice: How about you use that same energy and make a better app. \ud83d\ude09","102":"Such a brilliant idea.: This app can change the future of music industry. I really liked the idea of creating an online platform for musicians. Sure the app will get better each day.\ud83d\udc4c","103":"Great people, buggy app: From the little I've used Vampr I'm loving how easy it is to make connections with others around music, but it is a buggy app. Devs please keep it up though!!! This is awesome!!!","104":"So far, so good.: The features are pretty good. Looking forward to seeing how this continues to develop. The integration into other apps seems solid.","105":"Failure with the update: People show up twice and back to back glitch. Your shoutout is now there when you type it have to waste time to delete it and type something new that was in my head already. Sometimes instead of 20 swipes you only get 6-10 swipes because the system is buggy.","106":"Groovy app for connecting and networking with other creatives.: Just started using the app but really dig it so far.  There is some serious value in networking.","107":"Vampr is AMAZING for Musicians!: I\u2019m obsessed with Vampr! It\u2019s such an incredible resource for musicians to connect all over the world and locally. As a independent artist, collaboration is so key to being successful and Vampr helps make that happen!","108":"Man seeking men (lol): Honestly, being able to have people find you and connect through common interests in genres is cool. I need to remember to check the app more.","109":"Just like Hinge but for musicians and music fans!: Easy to use. Lots of free features. I like seeing the music I have in common with others. Loving it so far!","110":"Great app: Truly useful and helpful. I\u2019ve been able to connect to many good artists. The free version is already very handy!","111":"Won\u2019t let me create an account properly: The account creator won\u2019t let me look up and select the minimum 5 artists I like to continue to the next page. When I type an artist in the search bar, nothing happens.\n\nIt only has Justing Bieber, and a varied selection of rap artists I\u2019ve either never heard of or don\u2019t care for to select.","112":"Decent but stay centered: If you\u2019re looking to just see who\u2019s nearby and willing to play then that\u2019s the extent of this apps functionality. Otherwise it\u2019s peddling a garbage subscription service not to mention crypto and NFT scams. Don\u2019t give this app a dime and don\u2019t engage in any other \u201cfeatures\u201d it may offer.","113":"Amazing network tool: I\u2019ve met a couple artists close to me that need my services and even globally. I\u2019m looking forward to networking & growing my production business with this app\ud83d\udcaf\u270a\ud83c\udffd\u203c\ufe0f","114":"Overall great: The app can be a bit buggy but other than that I\u2019m enjoying it more than I thought I would. This is perfect!","115":"Provides opportunities: I have yet to work with the people on here yet, but I\u2019ve built connections that will help greatly in my career.","116":"Great idea ,  not there yet: Saturated with people using it for bot driven self promos. Need better controls around that. \n\nAlso filled with flaky amateurs ,  not surprising \u2026 but it\u2019s like what if you took the terrible tinder dating scene and put it on top of the semi-professional music industry? You get Vampr","117":"Pretty good: I wanted to start playing to go out and gig and found a band to play with. I\u2019ve been gigging for a few months and it\u2019s all thanx to Vampr. Great app it does need improvements, but overall good.","118":"Great concept, still needs tweaking: I love the platform, but some of the functions are slow and not as user friendly as they could be. Feels like a work in progress, but I still love it","119":"Actually found some people to jam with: App did what it was supposed to do, was worried it was some sort of weird tinder knockoff for musicians but it\u2019s solid lol","120":"Great app with some quick fixes: Met and networked with a fair amount of music people on this. Issues include some messages not appearing even thought they are in the notifications and a very apparent lack of Vampires.","121":"Vampr: This app is a good way to network with other people in the same interest as you. Try it out for yourself \u270a\ud83c\udffe","122":"So far so amazing: I just signed up and already have made some good contacts. Hopefully it turns into making some music together!","123":"Easy connect: Easily able to find people in your are to collab with.","124":"Updates are wack: I liked it better when you could post vamps and upload clips of music or images you can\u2019t do it no more and it\u2019s hard finding new artist(s) when no one takes music as serious as I do another thing the app keeps freezing everytime I enter it","125":"How\u2019s about some actual musicians to select during profile creation?: When I think about music, I think about diversity in people and genre. All I am seeing is rap and pop music. No rock music (not Imagine Dragons or 21 Pilots, that stuff is FAR from rock) or metal music. The only marginally talented artist aside from Coldplay on the list is Ariana Grande, and I only consider her talented because of her coloratura and whistle tones.","126":"Connecting on here is great: Connecting on here is great definitely would recommend to my friends who are creators","127":"Profile disappeared: My account randomly disappeared and I had to make a new one. Apparently I never used an email, Facebook, or iCloud account when I signed up because everytime I tried to sign in it made me create a new one for each","128":"Great way to connect: I\u2019ve already started making connections with nearby artist, thank you Vampr","129":"Good idea: These guys are very open to feedback on the app and willing to make changes based on user suggestion. I have NEVER seen that with a developer","130":"Too soon: I haven\u2019t used this app much, but it\u2019s enjoyable when I do. Hopefully it will add to my performance portfolio somehow.","131":"Great tool for artist: Finally a social media for artist to work together been looking for something like this","132":"Good idea, still reviewing but so far I like this app: When I make a real connection and actually Collab on some music I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out","133":"Really useful for artist: Everything you need to explore other artist and expand your horizons","134":"Cool idea, glitchy interface: Sometimes messages dont show as sent for a sec so it\u2019s easy to double send a message. Great idea though","135":"App crashes every time: Love the idea of this app but it crashes every time I try to load notifications. I\u2019ve uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing. I\u2019ll check back when app is fixed and give it another go.","136":"REAUX\u2019s View: Honestly, the best app out there that genuinely gets you connecting with your Tribe. I\u2019m seaux grateful to the Most High God that I was Blessed to stumble upon this wonderful app. I love it a great deal!","137":"Killer connection starter: Brand new to the app and have already made 3 contacts for possible collaboration. Been on it for 5 minutes. It\u2019s great.","138":"Too soon to tell: Gave a 4 star cause I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been on the app for about 3 swipes but y\u2019all asked for a review. So maybe a little more patience before asking for a review and it\u2019ll get 5 stars?","139":"App feedback: The app is perfectly fine just the artist on here aren\u2019t good it\u2019s rare to find a good artist on here I\u2019m On all platforms Vvs october","140":"So far so good: Allows you to hook up examples of ur work +instagram. Real users are on the app. Also the filters seem to ACTUALLY work . So if i put 5mi. Its not showing someone in new yorkk lol.","141":"Yes!: I\u2019m enjoying the app. It\u2019s refreshing to have likeminded talents all in the same space. I am building my musical network.","142":"Would Recommend: This is a really great app for a wide variety of connecting with many walks of life.","143":"Best Musician Connection App: Like Tinder but better because it\u2019s the type of music everyone can enjoy","144":"Best App For Artist: This app can easily grow all of your social accounts if you\u2019re putting out quality music. This is the best untapped avenue for artists ready to explode.","145":"Great source: Just got the app and it\u2019s very beneficial to producers such as myself that are starting and finding artists to collaborate with","146":"Pretty Good: Of the four or five musician connection apps I've tried, this seems to be the best so far.","147":"pretty cool so far: I like how it matches you based on music, and the ability to pitch music for sync opportunities","148":"There needs to be a third option: Since this isn't tinder, there needs to be a way to push somebody's profile to the back of the line without fully swiping left.","149":"I don't know.: I'm putting 3 stars cuz I got it yesterday. When it says sync it with your favorite brands do you guys own my music? You should've made that clear. I read the terms too.","150":"Good app: Easy to use. Made a couple connections. Still feeling it out.","151":"Worst experience of my life in music: Beware of predatory promoters selling illegal products on this site. It looks like the people who run it Don\u2019t care to protect members much at all. I\u2019ll certainly never be a part of it again after one terrible experience and contacted people with more authority about it.","152":"So far the best app for meet musicians: I just wish the app have more adds - so more ppl sign up","153":"Vampr makes the world accessible: I connected with an artist from Nigeria and now we have an EP coming out!","154":"So far, so great!: Loving the ability to connect with other musicians in the area! Thank you!","155":"Awesome: Meet\nAlways meeting so many people easy to work and happy to hear ideas","156":"Dope: Downloaded 2 minutes ago already hopping on another artist\u2019s track.","157":"It\u2019s pretty gnarly: Maybe it\u2019s cus of my area but a lot of familiar faces a lot of bozos but also a lot of talent more people should use this tbh","158":"Every artist should try it out fr: Beautiful app highly recommend","159":"Amazing: I just got this app but it\u2019s amazing! Made it easy to network with other artists and producers!","160":"Seems helpful: Starting to speak to some people with similar goals. That seems valuable.","161":"Great app: Great app!! I\u2019m a bass player and I\u2019ve already joined 2 bands this passed month. I just wish more musicians knew about it.","162":"I\u2019ve been looking for an app like this.: This is a very powerful tool if you know how to network.","163":"This is why i don\u2019t download unknown apps: Downloaded it, made an account worked on my bio and uploaded pics, then it froze. Haven\u2019t been able to get back in it since just keeps crashing. So annoying can\u2019t even delete my profile now.","164":"This app rocks: They even got a section to see the news on all your favorite artists and bands its a very versatile app for music lover and artists!!!","165":"Great layout and service: Love the entire idea of the app for artists to connect","166":"Great idea, done horribly: I never get notifications when someone messages me. Still matches me with DJs even though I didn\u2019t list them as someone I\u2019m looking for. Tried re downloading the app to give it another try, now it won\u2019t allow me to log in","167":"Great experience: Great networking space highly recommend to all artist","168":"Recording Artist: Great way to link up with other creative people in music and arts","169":"Batting out of its league: Great app. Only getting better too from what I can tell!","170":"Great networking tool: This is so much better than sifting through Craigslist!","171":"Can't post!: I am unable to post vamprs as I am getting stuck on the loading screen. I don't see an option to contact support, what am I meant to do here?","172":"Nice app, but\u2026: Wish it wasn\u2019t structured like a dating app: wish you could kind of scroll through people\u2019s profiles instead of having to swipe.","173":"Great connection app: This App is awesome if you\u2019re planning on meeting musicians in your area or doing projects for people.","174":"Blakkk: Great way to connect and build with other artists","175":"Crash: Very great app, very great concept. It\u2019s been crashing constantly though and need this bug fixed ASAP, I find business on this app and that\u2019s being interfered with","176":"glitchy app: This is a fantastic idea that is very poorly carried out. The app crashes regularly and often takes a long time to load. \n\nUpdate: now it doesn\u2019t work at all.","177":"Wow: What an amazing idea. I downloaded it a couple hours ago and I\u2019m already talking to fellow musicians. This thing is really cool.","178":"New Way to Connect: Vampr is a great way to connect with artists through the world!","179":"Amazing networking tool: It\u2019s definitely helping me to find people in my area.","180":"Greatest idea ever, some bugs to fix: I love being able to feature other talented artists in songs! Please fix the messaging bug asap! PLEASE!","181":"Nashville: This may work other places, but in Nashville, this thing is killer. Five stars. Great way to network","182":"Great app: Connected me to a lot of artists so far it\u2019s day one definitely reccomend","183":"Good app: Good app, customer service was responsive and helpful with my problem.","184":"It works!: Connections in just hours! Such a superb idea that helps anyone in the music industry.","185":"Great app: A very well functioning well coded app that really helps you connect with others artists, five stars!","186":"App keeps freezing when trying to fix preferences: App doesn\u2019t worked and feels half baked. I also see in the 1 star reviews that the devs are lazy and don\u2019t try to fix any of the bugs\u2026. I strongly recommend not wasting your time with that app.","187":"They asked me to review it: Although I just downloaded it and couldn\u2019t really tell you if it\u2019s a good app or not yet.","188":"Not bad: There\u2019s a limited amount of swipes to it I didn\u2019t expect but everyone\u2019s got to make money somehow","189":"It\u2019s alright: Cool app so far. Only problem is you only get to look through so many profiles before you find someone you\u2019d like to work with, so if you\u2019re a picky artist, this isn\u2019t the app for you.","190":"great for small musicians!!!: this app is so good for small musicians, i\u2019m connecting with so many other musicians after finally starting to use the app. it\u2019s helpful in ways that i\u2019ve never had in all my years trying to surround myself with other music creators\/lovers.","191":"Vamps lagging: Trying to post a second video vamp, but it keeps lagging. In The first vamp the sound is in time with the video. When trying to posts second, it lags and does not match up with the video?","192":"Some features are buggy: But glad the app exists","193":"Great app!: 10 out of 10 recommend so far\u2026haven\u2019t ran into any weirdos atm lol","194":"Very cool: Super cool concept! Makes it easy for you to meet people all at the edge of your fingertips","195":"Solid app: Does it\u2019s job . One day in Im already making connections with rad people !","196":"A NETWORKING MASTERPIECE!: Not even 20 minutes on the app and im already networking and planning collaborations! This app has truly boosted my path towards musical greatness!","197":"Currently can\u2019t use: Can\u2019t open the app without it crashing on the load screen.","198":"Great app, exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for: Great app, exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for","199":"Garbage! Beware!: Broken with a pathetic user base! Beware! App worked for a few weeks. After that I was signed out and all my info (music, pictures, links) was wiped out and I was told to start from scratch. I didn\u2019t. I just deleted the app. Waste of time. Plus, like I said, no one is even on there. Pure trash! Stay away!","200":"A great opportunity: This is a fantastic platform to be on if you want to meet local new talent to work with you.","201":"About what you\u2019d expect: I mean, it\u2019s pretty much the tinder for musicians, except... ya know, for music, not dating and stuff","202":"Just what ive been looking for: Great app for finding musicians and friends to collaborate with","203":"App is amazing: This app is amazing.  I was a little upset at need to pay to hide age.  Feels like taking advantage.  Many have tried similar app.  Over all most land flat on their face.  Too soon to tell if this one will catch on.","204":"Awesome to connect: Already booked a show and performed in a feed days","205":"Only for modern pop: Makes you pick favorite artists during signup. Only has a short list of modern superstars like Wknd and Doja Cat even though I picked jazz and Prog rock as my music styles. Probably just full of beatmakers.","206":"Needs a little improvement: Please fix the glitches and bugs ! Pretty good app though","207":"So far outstanding!: Just like it\u2019s advertised so far!!","208":"Navigation: Better navigation, it\u2019s sort of clustered","209":"Interesting concept: So far looks good. Cannot wait to make some connections.","210":"Genres: Off rip, making my account my music genre does not appear. I make hyperpop and there is no selection for that","211":"LOVE: It\u2019s been so easy to reach out and connect with other musicians!","212":"Rating: I like this platform! Great way to network ! Thank you to the creator!","213":"Looks great!: SoundCloud songs don't seem to load on profiles, hoping for a quick fix!","214":"Need more users. \ud83d\ude15: If there was a lot more users I would give it a 5 star for the awesome idea and the functionality \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd25","215":"Flawless: Haven\u2019t found a legitimate flaw yet","216":"The app needs a lot of work: The app needs major work, a lot of technical errors and issues and can\u2019t seem to find hardly anyone near me","217":"So far so good: It connects you very easily to other musicians, love it so far!","218":"Great concept, good interface: Liking the app so far","219":"Great to meet other artists!: So dope, you get to connect and collaborate with other musicians!","220":"It\u2019s cool but\u2026: It\u2019s a cool app but I had to get the subscription to make it fun and cool so it\u2019s not really cool like that if you have the basic version","221":"Cool new platform: Haven\u2019t used it much yet but so far it\u2019s user friendly and a great way to connect","222":"Great app: I like this app so far! Hopefully I make it big one day!","223":"Love it!: So easy to make musician friends. Just what I was looking for!","224":"Good concept: Kinda laggy but gets the job done","225":"Does what it says!: I\u2019m a worship leader in a new city and wow this has helped me find new musicians!","226":"Seems cool so far: First day and made a connection","227":"Not very good but has potential: Potential to be a good app however UI is clunky, and user base is very inactive, making for a weak overall experience since not much is going on. Filter also doesn\u2019t work great for places that do not have a very large music scene.","228":"Vampra: Okay, it\u2019s a cool app and I am excited to find connections to make meaningful music.","229":"Amazing app: I'm looking forward to so much more","230":"Messages keep disappearing: It\u2019s fine.

Even the group chats just fly by with no responses. Is anyone on this app real?","247":"Completely frozen: After setting up my profile, the app completely froze and there\u2019s no way to use it.

This was very much scam likely vibes.","330":"Good connections: It\u2019s been nice to mees new people!! \u270c\ufe0f","331":"Profiles put all the wrong things up front, useful content is buried, cluttered, convoluted: Seeing a person's profile on Vampr is such a repelling experience. As an actual music professional trying to find session musicians, Vampr makes it as difficult as possible in their UX. All the useful information (like audition video) is only visible if you tap on a card full of relatively useless info (like \"lives in some random town in Canada 3000 miles away\") and then scroll past a LOT of extraneous visual clutter that doesn't provide useful info to collaboration seekers to finally reach useful content (audition video, services, bio). In other words, you have to tap and scroll on every single person as if you WERE proactively interested in them just to get to content and information that will help you discover whether you ARE interested in them. If Vampr ran Tinder, they'd have you go on a coffee date with everyone on the platform and then decide which one you want to go on a coffee date with once you're done with that. It's just such a backwards way of having people swipe through a stack of contact cards. The devs need to pretend they're an actual musician trying to sift through the millions of people in the world who might be useless to them, and set a timer for 15 minutes, and pretend they have a deadline to record their song in exactly 15 days, and then look at a real live users contact card and look at every single piece of info on that contact card and ask themselves \"what does this info ACTUALLY help me to do right now regarding determining whether this person is a fit for my project?\" spoiler alert, the answer is \"nearly nothing\" for everything on the contact card except for \"view profile\", so we can conclude that it is backwards. \"profile\" should appear first (with all of the bottom sections on the top) and the profile page should have a tap button to view what is currently the \"card you swipe through\". I can't believe i don't get paid for this sort of advising.\n\n(p.s. i know there are people out there who are seeking \"nearby people to physically collaborate with\" and thats why you need a user question early in the sign up \/ swiping process that prompts the user to declare whether physical proximity is more important than functional compatibility. In the case of the former, the current card swiping pipeline is (barely) more user-friendly, but for the latter, it's useless and requires every user to do three times the work of tapping \/ scrolling \/ swiping \/ thinking \/ analyzing than they should have to.\n\nBut they sure do make it easy to sign up and pay them money, which is fine, but i'm just saying if the information and connections that the app could provide its users was as front-and-center as its monetization hooks, Vampr might be useful enough to warrant a subscription.","332":"Groovy baby: Like it a lot","333":"Love it \ud83d\ude0d: Good way to meet like minded artist!","334":"Cool!: Been looking for band mates, and this app seems legit.","335":"Terrible: The interface on the app is slow .

This is the biggest thing holding this app back. \n\n- - - \n\n2) iPhone X support -\n\nNot very difficult to update and will go a long way in terms of professionalism and app support.\n\n- - - \n\n3) Improving the way you connect after swiping right -\n\nI have 412 notifications from artists who have 'connected' with me, but only like 30 or so messages from those who have actually reached out. I believe it would improve the app if the list of \"connections\" and the list of \"messages\" were separated in the app as it gets pretty jumbled up mixing the two together. It would also be great to be able to separate the connections that you added with the connections who added you. \n\n- - - \n\n4) (suggestion) Replace the \"Favorites Artists\" tab with something of more substance -\n\nVery very rarely have I looked through this  part of someones profile when deciding to connect with them or not and yet this is the first thing you see. I think this would be a cool place to allow for a longer description of \"What are you looking for?\" or something similar. Just a suggestion!\n\n- - - \n\nHope this helped the app developer or whoever. This app is very close to be great and I'm excited to see it continue to grow!","362":"No one ever found: I keep looking and no one can ever be found","363":"Super nice so far: Loving it","364":"Trusting the process: Is a fantastic app actually seeing and meeting with  things I desire, (Music )\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udcbd","365":"Sick: love this app. great for collaboration","366":"Can\u2019t get past crest an account: It wouldn\u2019t even let me choose an instrument that I play","367":"Blessings: So helpful","368":"Necessary: Yoda said: \u201cApp this Necessary Is!\u201d","369":"Make sense: It\u2019s good","370":"Great idea well done: !yes!","371":"Great app good talent: The artists on here are amazing","372":"Glitches everywhere: So buggy I can even use it","373":"Hi!: This app is fun, I recommend","374":"App does what it\u2019s intended: It\u2019s a good app for networking","375":"Grateful!: So needed for musicians!","376":"Broken!: This app is broken!","377":"Best app: The best app by far","378":"a lot of placements so far: i love it","379":"Not cool: Subscription based. pay to swipe.","380":"Wonderful: Straightforward","381":"\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf: 10\/10 recommendation","382":"Nice!: Tickles my fancy","383":"nice!!: great to see there is a platform for artists to find eachother","384":"LinkedIn for musicians: Dope.

I don't know if we are the test market at the moment but it should've been tested because it's very buggy. One such example being I matched with a musician but every time I tried to see who the app crashed. Also the community on the app is extremely small. That's more a over time thing so I'm not really upset at it and I've told my fans about it to help it grow but I think with some sponsor backing, a good marketing\/or campaign and a little elbow grease this could be a giant hit for musicians the world over.","421":"GREAT IDEA: CANT WAIT TILL THIS BLOWS UP GREAT FOR NETWORKING","422":"It\u2019s cool: Cool","423":"\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a: Janemba approved","424":"DOPE SHIET: So far So Good","425":"Cool app: Yep!","426":"Sweet!: This is awesome!","427":"Swag: Nice","428":"yeah: yo","429":"Dope \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25: Tight","430":"Yeet: teeY","431":"Needs work: It's an awesome idea and I was super psyched about the concept when I downloaded the app, however immediately after sign in the bugs began. Couldn't find many of the bands I was searching for if I typed in the whole name and I either had to type it in wrong or not fully for the band to even show up, among other bio and search issues. The biggest problem I have is I get ghost notifications that people are replying to me and still not one person has responded to me nor sent me a message and I'm starting to believe that I'm getting responses and they're not appearing in the app, making this app completely useless. I have two notifications out of the app with nothing to show when I open it. If many bug fixes come in the very near future I would love to continue with this app! It's such a great concept I really just want it to operate smoothly :(","432":"Beautiful idea, but...: Unfortunately it doesn't work all that well :(. As far as setting up an account and seeing people through tinder glasses (which is quite cool may I add, because you can see similar music interests and what a person plays\/does) but the primary feature is busted. The messaging doesn't seem to work at all, it says I have messages when there aren't any, it doesn't seem anyone is actually getting my messages. Or I'm not getting there's, but regardless something seems flawed. Hopefully I can stick around to see these issues fixed. I'd been looking for a band when I saw the ad for this app on instagram. Super excited for the future! Keep up the hard work","433":"Been waiting for this for a long time: I've been waiting for an app like this for a while and it's finally here but I'm assuming there aren't many people using this app because I've expanded my preferences to as much as I'd be willing to expand them to without getting out of range of what I'm looking for and it still says it's searching for people. Rating five stars because I believe with enough time and the right support this thing will take off. Great concept put into a great app! Keep it up!","434":"Great idea!: I've been waiting for something like this for a long time, unfortunately I can't match up with anyone no matter what I do to the preferences. And I can't change the age range it's still at a comfortable \"0-0\".  Giving a 5 star for the idea itself.  Great idea.","435":"Please read my review first before installing.: Got it set up. Couldn't find ANY results. Adjusted location, miles and what I was looking for and nothing.  Found nothing. Kept playing with the adjustments and still found nothing.  Eventually wanted to try setting everything to 199 miles, no preference on gender, looked for all postitions, no preference on anything and still found NOTHING! I'm in Dallas. I'm not outside of Dallas. Not in the country. Either no one in Dallas has this app or its broken. Either way I removed the app, reinstalled it and went through the setup and tried it all again. I'm done. I removed it and maybe once it's working, I'll try it again. I will say the theory of the app could be amazing.","436":"Cool: I love the idea of this, but the app is really slow. Everytime I open it, I see the discovery preferences instead of people I can match with. And when I change my settings it takes minutes to change them and I usually end up just leaving the app. I haven't been on it for a while and now that I went back (I got a message from someone) I don't have any matches or messages. Fix this and I'll leave a better rating\/review.","437":"Simple easy to use colorful app: The app has a simple interface, it's easy and quick to use, it provides detailed info about the other musicians and people there. The only problem with the app that I found is that it constantly sends me notifications of new messages but when I open it to read them, there's no new messages, please fix that.","438":"We need this!: Still some tiny kinks to work out but I'm so excited that this exists - it is exactly what working musicians need right now. And the interface is really smooth, well-designed. I hope this gets huge! The potential is so there.","439":"Won't work.: Me and my friend have been searching for band members for the past month and have found no one. We saw this app and thought it was the answer to our problem, and it very well could've been.... if it worked. Cannot find a single person on the app and it also repeatedly says \"sorry there was an error updating your preferences please try again later,\" \nGreat idea, but the fact that this app won't even work gives it 1 star.","440":"Absolutely love the idea!: Not quite ready for prime time, also haven't been able to find any other users. Emailed the support team to see if it can be fixed, but definitely has some bugs that need to be worked out!","441":"Cool idea, but app needs work: It is truly like Tinder for musicians, but it's functionality isn't there. For whatever reason, the messaging system doesn't seem to work. I have only received one reply after chatting 6 different people, and that one reply happened to get deleted from my connections without telling me. \n\nIts main gimmick (communicating with other musicians) is FAULTY. This is a broken app. Please fix it - the idea is GOOD!","442":"Pretty good just one big issue: When you turn your phone while listening to an audition it stops the music. Turning the portrait orientation lock on doesn't fix the issue either.","443":"Five-Star Potential - Give Them A Chance: This app is a five-star idea. I'm going to stay with it because I really believe in it. I'd definitely recommend fixing the Discovery Preferences bugs first. Good luck, developers! Collaborative musicians are rooting for you!","444":"I really like the idea and have been looking for musicians but: The age range thing does work and bugs out at the start. The app won't let you get past the start up\/setup. Great idea though. I like the look of it. Maybe set up other ways to log in? Would love to see improvements as far as the app in general.","445":"Great Idea, Terrible App: The App sounded really attractive. I am excited and certain that if we give this app some time it can become a five star app. The issues are as follows.\n\nBarely any users.\nTerrible functionality.\n\nThose are all fixable but as of right now this app is so slow in response to touch, or any action in general. I can't even find people because the age range in my search preferences is stuck at 0-0 and no matter where I tap, it won't allow me to change.\n\nOnce again i think this app has amazing potential. I'm rating one star based on performance, and how close the experience of the app is to the perceived experience from advertisements. \n\nGood luck. Hope this app gets better.","446":"Can't Access the App: The app is a great concept. However, as soon as I tried to update my bio, the technical problems started. I couldn't save the updates. So I closed the app, and when I reopened it, I was getting error messages from the start screen. Now I can't access anything on the app at all. Is this just a scam to get access to people's Facebook info?","447":"Three stars for the idea: Great idea for an app, I had vision of this  idea a long time ago. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as advertised and it hasn't matched me with a single person in the 3-4 months I've had the app. All matchmaking preferences are open, still no dice. Hell, I'll take a triangle player just match me!","448":"Good idea but...: Great idea but terrible functionality. It also mildly upsets me that you have to make a profile through Facebook.\nI can't wait to see what you guys do with the app.","449":"Smart idea: Since apparently this doesn't work, I'm just going to bring myself out on the review section. I'm a singer in the Houston area who's best in pop kind of music, but can work around that if needed. If anybody needs to contact me, you can reach me through Instagram or Facebook: Mark Izarraras","450":"Love the concept: This is really a genius idea. I'm an artist that takes my work very serious and I love discovering tools like this. We get direct contact\/feedback with potential fans AND we can develop a network of connects within a very selective artist community. \n\nI don't know how I didn't think of this.\nI'm extremely impressed and I can't wait to see it grow more- as an interface and a community. \n\n((Small bugs --- restarting app seems to help))\n\n-@WoodstheMighty","451":"Lot of Potential: This app has a lot of potential I think it's still in time though. There is no sound for the auditions and I don't like having to create an account through Facebook but I'll stay with this app just to hopefully see it reach its potential.","452":"Great concept, app doesn't work: Really cool concept. I gave it 4 stars for the potential, unfortunately my app doesn't work at all. I open it and from there, it's just down hill with bugs.","453":"Awesome Idea: Big fan of the whole concept and really believe it can be a great way to collab with new artists of all types as long as people continue to join. -DeCesare Beats","454":"Great app but...: It doesn't work. Looks great, the idea is awesome and hopefully the community behind it gains traction because the world needs an app like this. Currently, though, it doesn't let me update discovery settings and many of the buttons don't seem to work","455":"Needs work.: Great idea however if you play someone's addition and don't stop it before you go to the next person it keeps playing and it won't stop until you exit, AND close the app. Super annoying.","456":"Great concept, dedicated developers: Love connecting with musicians all over the world, and the developer, Josh, responds very quickly to suggestions and feedback.","457":"Hopefully the ui smooths out soon: This concept is legendary. Just hoping the endless bugs get fixed and it starts working before too many people try it unsuccessfully and move on.","458":"Great idea, hope the app improves: I tried to set my preferences, and now the app won't let me leave that page showing an error message. I hope this is fixed soon, because it's a great idea for an app.","459":"Great idea but lots of bugs.: Great idea but still has a lot of bugs. I have people messaging me that I didn't even match with, and it's saying I match with everyone I swipe right to and I highly doubt that. But great concept overall. Just needs some updating.","460":"No FB account: I don't have a Facebook account how els could I log in??? It seems like it would be good.","461":"Waste of time: Instead of investing the time to develop the app and then build the user base they promote the app and it doesn't even function.  Also everyone I swipe right on I match with and out of all the messages I've send not one person has replied leading me to believe they're all ghost profiles","462":"Musicians should get on this: Really helped me find a producer and a singer for a song I was putting together. Smart","463":"Fix Sound Cloud Plug-In: The sound cloud samples don't work...booo. Not enough users. Other than that it's pretty cool. I recommend a search option by location\/genre\/instrument etc","464":"Can't delete account: Messages seem to be flawed. Keeps saying I have new messages and i don't. When i try to delete my account it stays on the loading icon and does nothing","465":"Won't let me set preferences: I open up the app, set my preferences for who I am looking for, and when I click done it gives me a dialogue box that says my preferences couldn't be updated. It does this every time I open the app and no matter what my preferences are.","466":"Good concept, bad execution: The messaging system is really faulty, my messages often don't load and when they do they are incomplete","467":"Cool idea. Kind of buggy.: This is a sweet idea and I hope it gets better. But it keeps glitching up.","468":"#IsileliMusic Approved!: This is one of the best apps. Can't wait to see what it grows into.","469":"Can only login through Facebook.: Only way to login is through Facebook. Not everyone has Facebook. Would have liked to try it, but never will if that's the only way to use it.","470":"Bugged notifications?: The app has a red 2 on it as if I have new messages but there's nothing new in the actual app. I was really hoping this app would be the best way to collaborate.","471":"Crashing: Cool idea, but it keeps crashing. I could barely even get started before the error messages started popping up. I would like to see this app fixed because the idea is great!","472":"Amazing for musicians and artist: Love this whole app and the way it's layed out","473":"Ok so far: From what I've seen it's okay but I've yet to further look into it once I do I will give another review","474":"Only FB login ??: That's the downfall of this app . You need to login with FB . I don't have Facebook so I can't even use it","475":"Smh: Pretty sure id be able to give 5 stars if i was actually able to access the app. I cant even get past setting up Discovery Preferences without the app crashing","476":"Great idea\u2014but there's bugs and issues: It's very slow, and I can't play auditions.","477":"Maybe if could use the app?: It won't even let me save my information to begging using the app. This is really upsetting.","478":"Great idea but needs Facebook: I was excited when I discovered this app but it requires you to log in with Facebook and I don't have or want a Facebook account so it's useless to me. Shame.","479":"The preference won't load: I love the idea of this app! When I try and make my preferences for musicians available it says it won't load. I don't know if this is a glitch or not.","480":"So far...: ...it's decent. The app tends to crash quite a bit on me.","481":"Very cool: Thanks!","482":"Good idea: It needs more members , but perfect idea","483":"You have to log in through Facebook: You have to log into the app through Facebook and I refuse to do that","484":"USA: Please Please please make this available in the USA!!\ud83d\ude05","485":"\ud83d\udcaf: This app helped alot\ud83d\udcaf","486":"Bummer: The idea of this app is great, but you can only login with facebook\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc. I don't like Facebook, so no vampr app for me.","487":"fix functionality: user interface is really clunky & the servers are bad as of now.  appreciate the idea and it'll be really nice to use once it's cleaned up.","488":"Ah: There's a discovery preferences bug I don't know how to fix....","489":"Broken: The app just won't work","490":"Cool idea but the app never loads properly: Cool idea but the app never loads properly","491":"Yes: I ship this","492":"Dark mode: Pls!!!","493":"\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd: So far so good","494":"Excelente: Muy buena plataforma para ponerte en contacto con otros m\u00fasicos que est\u00e9n cerca de ti \ud83d\udd25","495":"I like it: Enjoyed using it so far!","496":"Buena app: Ha Sido buena app para conocer m\u00fasicos y proyectos nuevos","497":"\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d: Jammin \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd20","498":"Excelente! Pero\u2026: Me parece excelente la app todo funciona perfecto y esta s\u00faper innovador!! No le doy 5 estrellas porque siento que le falta fluidez a la app siento que aveces va como un poco lageado","499":"Vampr: Neat design, nice courses.","500":"Pretty good so far: Hopefully they get the spotify linking going soon.","501":"Fire: Best app ever","502":"Nice app: Nice app","503":"Vampr: 5stars excellent","504":"\u00datil: Me encanta es s\u00faper \u00fatil","505":"Guilty until proven innocent: My account was wrongly suspended after so called \u201cflags\u201d on my account that i was never made aware of. Then i was told \u201ci contacted the radio station and nobody knew of me\u201d. This entire situation seems a bit childish and personal and for people running REAL businesses, i DO NOT recommend vampr. Use instagram, youtube, linkedin. Vampr will suspend your account without warning, without proof, without evidence, with little research.","506":"Great \u2728: Everything is pretty good, and it could be even better if there were a way to link music streaming platforms like Spotify or iTunes to the release or credits.","507":"Don\u2019t Waste Your Time: If you\u2019re a music industry professional, do not waste your time. I don\u2019t understand why this app seems to attract people who\u2019re not serious at all. It\u2019s kind of mind blowing actually. They\u2019re either information vampires, users, and or are looking for a \u201cdeal\u201d. They have a hard time with commitment. I\u2019ve ran into many other professionals experiencing the same thing. It\u2019s crazy.","508":"This mf Fye I ain\u2019t gon Lie: I barely be giving reviews fr but this app good no cap, especially for Underground Artists And Producers. Or even just people looking for musical talent . \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\u203c\ufe0f","509":"Cannot Add YouTube by Link: Whenever I try to link to a video on my YouTube account nothing comes up. With all due respect I\u2019m not going to give this app access to my account.","510":"so many bugs: i never write reviews on apps but vampr is so bug-ridden this beats screaming into a pillow. none of the external connection features work (soundcloud, youtube). you can\u2019t edit while you type your bio. it\u2019s one of those apps where it\u2019s a nice concept but if another app with a similar idea came out, vampr would fold in a month since the execution here is so poor.","511":"Can\u2019t Add Media: There are options to sign in to Spotify, but this isn\u2019t actually an option (just something they plan to allow you to do someday). Other options force you to sign in to other accounts, which isn\u2019t great for security. I just want to post my links. I couldn\u2019t post YouTube links. It wouldn\u2019t let me post SoundCloud links that I\u2019ve listed as private either. And when I tried to upload the actual song, it kept bumping me out of the app. So this app is currently useless to me. I\u2019ll check back if they ever make it possible to post actual links or upload music instead of having to let them access your other accounts.","512":"This works: Found a bandmate and a photographer, connected with lots of people along the way. It really does help to send a note when you swipe and having video up is great. Views count towards youtube views, which is cool.\n\nThis was in the context of folk musicians in a fairly big city, can\u2019t speak to other genres or every market but this is completely worth a try, give it time and put the same effort in as you would on social media.","513":"THE BEST: By far the best networking app for unsigned artist who have a real passion for music. I\u2019ve met lifelong friends, partners and various musicians through this app. 100\/100 would recommend!","514":"Has so much potential!: Developers did good work on the app. A couple bugs here and there but the team appears to be fixing them, so props to you guys! Only downside is the lack of engagement among users and I think this entirely due to the swipe left\/right UX. It really doesn\u2019t encourage interaction among users and feels like a dating app. I think this is the wrong approach. Here\u2019s some things that could help improve this app:\n\n- Rooms or groups to share music that encourage interaction would be awesome, like SoundCloud groups were back in the good days.\n- Some type of reward system for interacting on the app that encourages users to be more active.\n- The ability to post more than two songs on your profile would be great. The choice of one SoundCloud link and one YouTube link is not enough.\n- A song feedback and follower exchange platform could be fun and helpful for a lot of people and could encourage interaction. Unfortunately SoundCloud closed their API long ago.\n- Collaboration tools. A bulletin board with \u201cremix this sample or loop\u201d, \u201crecord a drum beat to this guitar loop\u201d, \u201cput an instrumental to these vocals\u201d where people respond with an example of their skills. You could virtually tryout for a band! Go a step further and put successful collaborations done by 2 or more Vampr users in a Spotlight where others can listen and comment and see \u201csuccess stories\u201d.\n\nI get that the swipe structure was a good MVP but Vampr could actually be really cool with some of these features, instead of just Tinder for musicians.","515":"Connecting is great: This app is amazing I\u2019m so happy to be able to connect and talk to other creatives out there in the industry follow my ig @s.u.z.y.nu","516":"Mid: I tried setting up a profile and couldn\u2019t even finish with the first steps. It\u2019s very very glitchy, not sure why I should connect my YouTube it would be smart to able to upload audio files but this app decides to complicate everything. I might try it again in a year or maybe in a few monthes when updates come out and allow me to actually finish making a profile.","517":"Amazing & Time Saver: Hey! My name is Cheeto, I am a graphic designer. On a dedicated day to my work, I endlessly scroll through Instagram and TikTok looking for musicians who are willing to work together. Vampr makes that easier. A new potential artist at my fingertips. I can build that personal connection with them. \nThis is one the best apps ever made!!!! \nMy Instagram is @Lostincheeto","518":"The app is great: I live in a place where I\u2019d never meet any musicians without it. IG: @rozayydaruler","519":"Not too shabbier: This app is okay. I wish. It let me live stream and drop my vids without having to go through YouTube. I love that there is a place that lets us connect but no live button come on.","520":"Very cool: Wanted an app like this for a while! It\u2019ll be even better after more people join. Only issue is about 50% of the embedded youtube links don\u2019t work.","521":"Great app but unreliable users: I\u2019ve been using it for about a year, maybe more. The app it\u2019s self isn\u2019t the issue and the features are great. I wish you could upload Spotify songs instead of SoundCloud though as I rarely use SoundCloud. \n\nMy issue is that I\u2019ve had 2 very recent instances where people just don\u2019t respond after messaging back and forth, getting a gameplan going. I am very flexible, respectful and I don\u2019t like to procrastinate. But people just ghost you. If you ask me to collaborate with you and you don\u2019t like what you hear (even though you can listen to the quality of my music on my page and links) all I ask is you give constructive criticism or tell me you don\u2019t want to go farther. Don\u2019t waste my time. I\u2019ve had more instances of this in the past. I\u2019d rather someone deny me than lead me on in collaborations. \n\nI\u2019ve deleted the app for good. I wish I could prevent myself from downloading it again in the future if I felt gullible and optimistic.","522":"Professional artist review....: This is probably the best idea for the Mobil music industry. The problem is many things like the servers and the bugs. I gave it a four star because the concept is so amazing! But all the problems limit people from moving forward on this app, Iv worked with people like panic!at the disco, imagine dragons and other big name artists, most of the huge artist have talked and know about this app but it's quality is still needing improvement. I still have faith and high hopes for the creators and team working on this! Thanks again dannyclay.site","523":"Needs work: I was going to invest on Wefunder. I am a songwriter musician and thought before I give them my money I should use it.  I went through the steps to sign in. So first off  no Americana genre? No biggy I typed it in. I put in my info and it\u2019s been searching for people to share with for about two or three hours throbbing triangle. So, I decide well I will contact them to let them know I\u2019m getting nowhere. The contact page is blanked out grey and a throbbing Vampr triangle logo sits there over it. It\u2019s been doing that now for about an hour. It\u2019s locked up. I noticed 2 years ago you were getting buggy app reviews. The the more recent reviews seemed to be getting better but not for me. \nMaybe there is an option for a feature to just scroll through every genre we want to and search on our own that would be nice.if there is I did not see it. You would have to impress me more than you did to get me as an investor. When start ups  realize their customers time is more valuable than theirs and experimenting with customers time could be detrimental to the future of the company and the product should work somewhat before it goes to market we will all be better off.","524":"Positive Music Love Focused Driven Spirits inStall: Its new- that excites people to be creative & find bugs if any & limitations even if those are self originating from the negative reviewers themselves\ud83e\uddd0 \ud83e\udd13could have been a glitch fest doesn\u2019t matter \ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udd28there are real musicians spirits people\/ Us in there Waiting to get out to the world \ud83c\udf0e Join On that Note \ud83c\udfbc you will find what you will be excited about \ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6 & Music LoVers.

I love the concept but there are some bugs and not a lot of users but understandable as this seems to be a newer app so willing to stick it out. I wish there was a way to link to a song on bandcamp or Spotify on your profile since myself and a lot of other people also have music on those platforms but other than that really good and I'm excited for further updates","526":"Has potential but linked tracks need work: Unless the track linked is from YouTube it doesn't work for me but the idea is dope","527":"Dope but needs work: Beside the issues below he SoundCloud connect will not play the song you link to your profile... I'll upload to YouTube to get my songs up but it's an inconvenience since I use SoundCloud the most. Still an awesome concept","528":"Facebook login as artist?: Great idea. However, I want to login using my Facebook artist page that is linked through my Facebook account. Am I able to do this? Also, the ability to link a Spotify account would be useful as well.","529":"Idea is alright but app doesn't work properly: Idea is cool,but app really doesn't work properly.I cannot even regulate my Age select field.There's simply no button for it,while my friend has that on his phone .It's also not searching for anyone.","530":"Will be better in the future: Hard to get past the setup, keep getting \"cannot connect to server\" error code, but I love the idea and I really hope things smooth out so tons of people can start using the app!"},"Source":{"0":"Apple App Store","1":"Apple App

Most issues are resolved very quickly. As far as I can see we never received any such email from you. Thank you for noting that the app reviews are improving. If you have seen our crowdfunding campaign or read our regular blog updates you will note that we have addressed the need to fix some bugs and that in order to do so we need additional capital. It's chicken and egg stuff unfortunately. When running a startup with a small team and on a lean budget things don't always operate as smoothly as, say, Facebook. But we do our best, and thank you for noticing this. Addressing one of your specific points: you can indeed search through all genres. In Discovery Preferences simply remove or loosen your genre search restrictions. With respect to your comments about how a social network like Vampr might launch or operate, we thank you for taking the time to weigh in. The reality is we aren't experimenting on anyone. We are doing our best (the <5 of us who work on code) and respond to every piece of feedback on all forums. Vampr is free to use - this has helped us grow the largest platform of its kind, but it means we have limited resources. That you personally had a bad experience is regrettable however we could have handled this more respectfully and effectively over email rather than a negative review about our crowdfunding campaign on the App Store. Nevertheless, I remain reachable and would love to help resolve your issues at info@vampr.me. Of course I can't promise a resolution but I can promise to do my absolute best.
