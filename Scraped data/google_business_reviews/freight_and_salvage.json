        "ReviewContent": "The Freight and Salvage started out at two different locations near San Pablo Avenue one of which I used to sweep the floors at when I was in my teens, and served as part of an underground and folk touring circuit that supported musicians traveling from around the country many who would later reach the heights of stardom. Theyre move Uptown to this new location brought with it a loss of some of the old vibe, but the sound is better, and their booking is excellent. Again as with the Repertory Theater across the street, this is fast becoming the spot where Berkeley Elite come to play, since the door charge and drink cost are at this point more than any actual Working Class People in Berkeley can pay anymore. This is how this entire area is turning out, it puts on the face of being about the working class, while having left those actually in the working-class behind years ago. So I love the place, and I cant stand the place. It represents something beautiful, and it represents something sad. Welcome to Berkeley",

They apparently forgot the agreement got rid of it without notifying me -- and werent willing to even try to track down what they did with it beyond confirming it was gone.

The crew, volunteers and professionals, are friendly and helpful, accommodating the wide variety of needs of our multi-instrumentalist band members. Sound check is a breeze, as the theater is well equipped, the room is intimate but spacious, and the technical team is knowledgeable about the sophisticated board. Backstage is comfortable and spacious, and can accommodate more than one act handily. Showtime is always a pleasure, with the audience pleasantly close. Live sound is adjusted well, and any difficulty quickly handled. If you want to see a great show, it sure is a good idea to go to a venue that gives its artists so much love. It will make everyone have a memorable experience.",

Amazing acoustics in their new venue right by Downtown Berkeley BART. Top notch musicians any day of the week. Affordable ticket prices (even the bigger-name acts names like Mary Chapin Carpenter & Judy Collins are only $50 tickets); most shows are just $16-$30), and *every* seat in the house is awesome. Plus they put on multiple free open house and music fest days for the community each year, and its obvious the staff truly love this place and the music it supports. Long live the Freight!",
