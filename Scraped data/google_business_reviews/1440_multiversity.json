Before arriving I was unsure about the mostly plant-based menu with limited meat options but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the eclectic meals. There was meat available for each meal. I had the opportunity to try foods that were foreign to me and most of it was great and the presentation was fantastic! I was also unsure about not having TVs in the rooms but it was actually encouraged some much-needed time to unplug a bit. That, with the surrounding nature, walking trails, and overall atmosphere truly provided the retreat I needed.",

The retreat center is nestled in the beautiful redwoods outside Santa Cruz, and the natural surroundings are breathtaking. From the moment I arrived, I felt a sense of peace and tranquility that I had never experienced. The staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, and the facilities were top-notch. The accommodations were luxurious and comfortable, and the meals were delicious and fresh. What sets 1440 apart is the quality of the programming. The retreat I attended was focused on mindfulness and meditation for nonprofit leaders, and the instructors were some of the most knowledgeable and inspiring people I have ever met. They led us through various exercises and practices that helped me connect with myself and other leaders in ways I never thought possible. I cannot recommend 1440 Multiversity enough. Whether youre looking to deepen your teams spiritual practice, improve well-being, or take a break from the stresses of everyday life, this retreat center has everything your organization needs. The beautiful setting, top-notch facilities, and expert instructors make it a truly unforgettable experience.",

        "ReviewContent": "Literally everyone we met was warm, friendly, kind, helpful and listened with heart. I was absolutely blown away by the supreme level of customer service at 1440 Multiversity for our retreat. Each interaction with people wasnt just high quality- I felt truly connected to each of the staff. They remembered what we shared with them. They were proactive in giving me a wonderful experience. If only health care could operate like this- we would literally change the face of it. The experience was genuine. AUTHENTIC service orientation- human to human. It didnt feel check the box. It felt like they were all passionate about serving and that is truly unique and a gift. Specific shout outs to: Carrie- front desk at check in who walked us around the upper campus when we arrived Wednesday. The folks at Common Grounds for always welcoming us with friendly smiles, asking if we wanted special coffees, and offering us blankets, cookies.. whatever we needed. They always had full stocks of La Croix sparkling water- I cannot tell you how happy that made me. That was like the best special treat. Keep offering that!!! What a treat!!! The events and logistics folks- specifically Irena, and the AV gentleman who helped us on Thursday for our workshop in Outlook 102. They were there early to set up with us, make sure everything worked and get us anything we need. The room was set perfectly. They had thought of EVERYTHING. The kitchen staff and chefs. WHERE DO I EVEN START- GOODNESS THEY ARE LIKE A GROUP OF MAGIC FAIRY GODMOTHERS. They went out of their way to get me an english muffin at lunch on the second day because I missed breakfast and wanted to try it. They were all amazing. They asked about our dietary restrictions every time and remembered. I felt seen and welcomed. Their desire to help was genuine and authentic and that is a truly one of a kind experience. The fact that the chefs also served was so cool. I felt like I was peeking into how the magic happened. Kim and Brianna- absolute gems. SO helpful. went way out of their way to accommodate us. Bri booked us a shuttle for Sunday at 4am and SHOWED up to pack us brown bag breakfasts and make sure we had coffee as we were departing. She woke up before 4 am to do that!!! That is beyond outstanding customer service- THAT IS HUMAN KINDNESS AND GOODNESS. Give her a raise, promote her and DONT LET HER GO.",

There are firepits for night-time story telling and a cafe where a good selection of wine & beer are available. The Kitchen is amazing with locally sourced / home-grown ingredients.  Great options for veggies and vegans. Cant think of a better destination for teaming events in the area.",

The campus and the staff are, together, such a refreshing combination that you cant help but be recharged after a few days. Not to mention the talks and speakers they have lined up. If you ever have a chance to go, DO NOT miss it. You will be spoiled silly (in a good way) but you will also be given tools and wisdom for facing the stress of your work.

There is a sense of belonging and sage place to drop into collective community. The food is over the top tasty and nutritious. In every way you can pick up the detail, small and big, that guides you in to experience exactly what your spirit needs/wants. It appears that each guests journey unravels through a sense of grace and ease. There is a sense of privacy and at the same time a sense of togetherness.

Currently, they are changing the lives of others who serve their communities--healthcare workers, teachers, first responders.   As a physician, I participated in a weekend program called Healing Our Healthcare Heroes along with other physicians, nurses, physical therapists, hospital managers, social workers.  It was an incredible experience, with 4 amazing workshops led by true change makers and addressing issues that healthcare workers are dealing with after a year of Covid care--trauma, moral injury, grief, as well as hope, growth, joy.  The caliber of speakers was reminiscent of TED Talks.  The accommodations are gorgeous, with buildings nestled in a redwood forest and hiking trails all over.  Id describe the rooms as glamorous rustic--clean, spacious, extremely comfortable, but also simple, minimalist, elegant.  The kitchen is gourmet, and the head chef creates so many healthy, colorful, and delicious meals, often from vegetables grown on the property.  They have > 100,000 bees!  The main dining lodge has a bathroom where, when you wash your hands and then look up to check yourself in the mirror, youre met instead by a large painted handwritten message which says, You Look Beautiful!  1440 Multiversity is an incredible place.  I am so grateful for the 3 days I spent there.",

        "ReviewContent": "I really believe the founders of this place had/have good intentions. What manifested in reality is most often facade, unfortunately. The campus is pretty, but the values are zero to none in praxis here. Some things could have changed since and, I saw a lot here. I am a queer, trans person who practices Buddhism. I thought coming to work here I would be relatively accepted.  Instead I was met with mundane violence by the institution. I was denied access to a proper bathroom for months while fighting for it. When it was finally approved, it took them months to buy and put up a sign. I was misgendered, met with fear and a few acts of hatred by my co workers, I was essentially gaslit by management. This happens all the time in work places to trans people and, it did happen here. In a spiritual center, that claims to truly embody certain neo liberal high ball dreams of open mindedness, acceptance and diversity. It is not ok to treat people the way I was treated, even if it happens in so many places. I eventually realized they were not able to offer me a work environment in which dignity would be attainable so I left. (I currently hold a job where I am fully afforded conditions in which I can retain my dignity.) The people highest up were so disconnected from the materials reality of others in America. The same problems were everywhere and people were socially dissuaded from speaking about it through negative social reinforcement, again in ways typical for institutions like this. The people who made the most money loved this cute and novel  idea  of altruism. While the majority of people were underpaid and overworked. While being expected to smile at rich white clientele and never say the word no, or cause them to have any bad feeling. They called it deep hospitality, it didn t play out well in real life application. This place left me with the impression that it serves, even if it s not intended to, as a front for people with money to feel good without addressing the discomfort needed to actually shift change in self and cause then social change. That requires radicalizing, which means radically accepting that your wealth does mean things about the way you move through the world and your ethics that you don t like or want it to. (I ve gone through this process myself/am still making changes so I can see my values in the way I occupy my privilege, knowing the material reality of others.) Sometimes they bring in good teachers, but I saw them, at that time at least, book anyone who will make money regardless of integrity. You can give your money to this place, but you might leave short 1.5 grand looking like a clown.",

My daughter and I registered for a 2 1/2 day seminar beginning Friday and ending Sunday at noon. One week before checking in I notified 1440 that we would be unable to check-in on Friday night because of a funeral of a good friend that had been scheduled the same Friday, late afternoon. 1440 refused to give any rebate for Friday night even though the facility was not near capicity. We also booked spa treatments. I booked a 50 min Crainosacral Therapy which was described as a gentle session which encourages the body to release stress and pain by light touch to the bones of the head, spinal column, and sacrum. This treatment began by hot towels to wash my feet and then the therapist lightly held the soles of my feet for at least 15 minutes and ended by doing the same. Besides additional light touch there was no other treatment to release stress and pain. This was at a cost of $145 in addition to a required 15% tip. The treatmentment was truly rediculous and a waste of money. A disappointing experience to say the least.",

Heres what my schedule looked like for a one night stay - arrived around 2:30 pm, and room was ready early (their website says 4 pm) and it appears I got an upgrade! - read, journaled, and did yoga in my room (plenty of floor space) - took a Tai Chi  / Quigong class at 4:45 - I wasnt excited about it, but the teacher was very good. - enjoyed a delicious dinner - vegan, veg, and meat options available and purchased a glass of wine - took a very relaxing meditation class in the evening, did more reading, went to sleep early - woke up early to work out in the gym - breakfast - gentle hike and more reading - yoga on my own - checkout and lunch",

Its like time slows down. You are surrounded by beauty (both stunning nature and architecture), a healthy environment (delicious food, no TVs, hiking trails, daily yoga/Tai Chi classes, an awesome fitness studio, a gorgeous healing arts facility with an amazing infinity pool), and tons of learning opportunity (ALL kinds of classes, courses, and talks by people like Brene Brown and Alanis Morissette).

        "ReviewContent": "5 out of 5 for 1440.  As someone who had stayed in all top 4 wellness centers in US (Omega, Kripalu, 1440, Esalen), I think I have some ground to make a fair comment.   As an educational retreat destiny for personal growth, core product we should be looking at is program quality and the facility around it, which I would say 1440, despite the newest among the 4, maintains at least equally high quality - I took SoulMotion class with Arjuna, a renowned spiritual dancer leader with over 40 year experience in this field, in Outlook workshop building, and many other sampler morning & evening classes such as drumming, improv, Yoga, and Qigong, in Sanctury, renoovated from the old chapel, with heating floor.  Beside this, the Redwood-facing hot spring is soothing and healing - though its different from Esalens cliff one, this is something I went to every evening connecting to the sky and smelling the redwood.   The campus itself is designed in a very warm and cozy style, and all staff are very kind and compassionate.  I can tell 100% that as a new center, theyre not inheriting the strength from the other established centers, but also innovating on their own - what struck me most is that I do NOT have to compromise food taste while seeking for nutrient & organic ingredients (the soup, the curry chicken, the dessert, the curated salad bowl, I attached some photos, I didnt gain any weight there but I surely enjoyed eating every bite of my food there, which is a rare experience in other centers esp. Omega), neither do I have to compromise accomodation quality for healthy living, the room is new without smell, sound proof is good so Im not waken up by people walking/talking in hall way, which happened in most of other centers).  I can write a long article about my experience in 4 centers, but I would just summarize in one line that, 1440 provides the best holistic expeirence for someone like me who has a no compromise attitude (were aggressive on our personal growth as well as food taste&living quality). I will definitely recommend my friend seeking their frist time wellness center experience to come here (with one more advantage of 1440 is its located 20mins drive from San Jose, bay area).   P.S. to be fair, if youre looking for experience prioritizing the best Yoga school with the most diverse workshops offerings, you want to try Kripalu, 3 hours drive north from JFK; and if youre looking for the rustic, cliff, hippie experience as most important, you want to try Esalen at Big Sur.",

        "ReviewContent": "I wanted to take a seminar scheduled at this location but changed my mind because the costs to stay in a dorm room quality accommodation was exhorbitant! Plus most of the rooms have no private bath - just a bath down the hall! I haven heard of such low rent accommodations since I traveled in Eastern Europe and those accommodations were cheap.. My friends who also planned to join me at the same seminar also changed their minds.. I would recommend considering a place with a private bath at a fair price.",

        "ReviewContent": "1440 is a wonderful concept: providing a venue for world-class teachers  to teach short courses in a beautiful, all-inclusive residential setting. The grounds and buildings are absolutely beautiful and they offer some amazing courses on fitness, self-improvement, relationships, and new-age philosophy. However, their systems are not up to the task of dealing with the volume of visitors. Check-in involves almost 2 hours of waiting in line. Because of a room change, they double charged my card and it has been over a month without a refund. I have called 3 times and they are always very apologetic, but still no refund. I really wanted to write a good review of 1440, but must be honest here.  On the plus side, while I was there, I enjoyed my stay,  despite the disorganization and incomplete facilities.  The food, in particular, was excellent and meals were well organized and well-planned. Update: 1440 looked into the situation and issued a refund. Because of their responsiveness and responsibility, I upgraded my rating to 4 stars.",

        "ReviewContent": "Just the opposite of their philosophy! No regard for the impact on the families in the neighborhood! Guests-employees speeding 24 hours a day running stop signs!   Delivery and construction vehicles at all hours ( No Deliveries before 8:00 am. ie. produce trucks) Sandwich board signs blocking sidewalks!  Dangerous!  ADA Employees parking in front of my house instead of using empty parking areas.  The owners need to sit at bench across the street from the preschool in the park/garden and see the percentage of employees/workers and guest speeding, running the stop signs and going right into the facility. No perks or compensation for the residence in the Bethany area.  Just clouds of dust, grit in our gardens & homes!  Fallout on our cars Noise pollution reckless driving happening every 1440 minutes in the day! How about establishing a Bethany homeowners group to help solve some of the problems and issues by working with all parties?  Just a thought",

        "ReviewContent": "This is not a rating for the course I went to, which was amazing and fabulous, rather a rating for the lodging and standards of care I would expect for a place like this (especially given the amount paid). I understand that they were delayed in their construction, and at the same time my experience was bad enough that I believe it warrants a rating. Firstly, a positive. The food was great, and the staff was friendly. For that they get two sars However the first night I got there I noticed an off smell in my room, it smelled like some kind of chemical, but I did not really pay attention to it. I went about my business and the training. The front desk staff told me that the place uses only non-toxic material. I have to say that it is hard for me to believe that given the smell I experienced (it smelled almost like a glue or adhesive.) I didnt appreciate being subject to the facility while it was still very much a construction zone, and paying full price for it. I hope that whatever I was smelling in my room was not toxic...",

        "ReviewContent": "As a neighbor I feel I have to counter the other negative reviews the alternatives to what could have been my neighbor. Yes, the trucks have ruined Bethany Drive and ideally it will be repaved; or patched in the remaining spots; and once you hit the construction site....they stop in the road so that is less ideal but I live past this project and lived through it when it was empty....and there were break ins of homes that had nothing worth stealing. Now the neighborhood looks great - the work they have put into the facilities to make them top notch... the old Bethany - there was no top notch - there was a blue tarp on the top of the spot, and i-beams that were to make a cafeteria. I do wish workers drover slower but I am thankful I am living next to mindful learning, respecting everyone and opening your mind experiences than condos, or an empty, vacant, desolate campus. Welcome to the neighborhood 1440 and best of luck with your opening weekend.",
