Everyone has been very friendly and helpful. Restaurant and general store is a bit expensive, as well as the spots to stay in. But it is the most beautiful campground I have seen and worth it.",

I found a place to park but then rudely approached to move my car because it was laundry only.  No sign saying so.  Restaurant wait for service and food was ridiculous.  Tried renting a large bike which are by the hour but was told I couldn t because it was too close (4:30) to their closing time (5:00) and it was  about to rain . Maybe some light mist which was throughout the day but they had no trouble renting to others when it was misty throughout the day.  Would have been fine with a short rental just to make my son happy for his birthday.  These people were too busy focused on what they didn t want to do instead of customer service.  Multiple staff using the line  we re short staffed  as an excuse for bad service and bad attitudes.  Too bad, it s a nice location.",

This seemed expensive but I booked anyway, the site is so narrow my stairs weren t able to step on asphalt.  Also if you are in the basic loop you are with the employees and all their stuff stacked around there RV s.  The Tengo internet will connect with a good signal showing, however the internet will not work.  Thank goodness we had 1 bar of AT&T.  The grounds look beautiful, but the rate is absolutely ridiculous, I have stayed at what has been voted the best RV park in California (Jackson Rancheria) and it only $70.00 and the sites are truly luxurious!

No explanation provided, he repeated several times that the owner of the KOA did not like RTTs. Then our friends who have a converted van have also been refused access on the grounds that they cannot rent an RV lot because they cannot connect to sewer and water. I have been to several KOAs in the United States, I have never experienced a situation like this. Nothing is stated about this on their website.

        "ReviewContent": "Came with a group of family and kids between ages 2-40 for a reunion. Facilities and location left s lot to be desired for the price. For $150 more a day I could have been staying in the Ritz Carlton instead of in a canvas bungalow with shared bathrooms. Bathrooms were updated, but dirty when I used them. I also had a chubby old dude yell twice at me while I was unloading my car in the campsite, because supposedly having more than one car in a 20 foot wide parking space is a sin. Most of the other staff was smiles, but this one particular guy was out of pocket. Location has walking access to a beach, but the property is very isolated from any hikes or other landmarks. Kids playground was nice and well kept. Beer garden pub had run of the mill food, but nice atmosphere. Wifi was intermittent. Probably would recommend skipping for the price and staying in Half Moon Bay proper or going to Santa Cruz if you are feeling Northern California beach vacation.",

        "ReviewContent": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Costanoa KOA and I must say, my experience surpassed all expectations. I feel compelled to share my thoughts, especially considering some negative reviews I came across. Its important not to judge this wonderful place based on a few isolated incidents, as my encounter with the staff was absolutely delightful. First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to Tammy at the check-in desk. Her great sense of humor immediately put us at ease, despite our near mishap with her plant while maneuvering our RV. She handled the situation with grace and professionalism, making us feel welcome right from the start. I also want to address the negative reviews about Dale, the head of security. Tammy assured us that he was a genuinely kind-hearted individual, and we were keen on meeting him. True to her words, Dale visited us during our stay, and we found him to be an incredibly friendly and helpful person. Not only did he take the time to chat with us, but he also shared fascinating information about the Blue Heron we had spotted earlier. It was evident that Dale genuinely cares about the guests experience and goes above and beyond to make them feel at home. During our stay, we had the pleasure of meeting Allan, the Facilities Manager. Allan was incredibly friendly and approachable, making us feel like valued guests. He even allowed us to walk our adorable Cockapoo, Cooper, into the grocery store a gesture that made us feel like part of the Costanoa KOA family. One aspect that truly impressed me was the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities. Everywhere we went, from the well-kept grounds to the sparkling clean bathrooms, we were met with an immaculate environment. Its evident that the staff takes pride in their work and ensures that guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. We had the pleasure of meeting Evan, a super cool guy with dark hair and dreadlocks, who made a point to stop by and greet us. Its encounters like these that make a stay truly memorable, as they foster a sense of community and camaraderie. Overall, I cannot recommend Costanoa KOA enough. This hidden gem offers excellent amenities, a pristine environment, and most importantly, exceptional staff members who genuinely care about the guests experience. My stay was nothing short of fantastic, and I hope the management recognizes the outstanding employees they have. Dont let a few negative reviews deter you Costanoa KOA is a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a memorable camping experience. So pack your bags, bring your furry friends, and prepare for an unforgettable stay at Costanoa KOA. You wont be disappointed!",

They even went out of their way to lie to try to get us to leave when their female blond staff member saw from 50 feet out that our dog was not on a leash. Which he was... on a ten foot leash that was double folded. She must be legally blind not to have noticed the dog tripping on the leash and me running behind him getting pulled by the leash. She then showed up with security minutes later and we were getting kicked out for not having our dog on the leash. I understand if this was an honest mistake and she just did not see the wire leash, maybe she needs glasses. either way, defamation is nothing to be taken lightly, and I will not be letting this go without an apology.

Good variety of camping / glamping options as well, from literal places for your tent to Lodge-style suites with fireplaces, theres something for every person and budget. One thing - they NEED to improve their wifi. Given that theres no cell service and no televisions, youre very cut off from the world. Its advertised that wifi is spotty but thats not true; its basically non-existent. Im the first guy to advocate digital detoxing, but they need to manage expectations (in other words, I need to know that Im going to be completely off grid). Id like to be able to at least check my email in the morning, and currently you really cant do that at Costanoa.",

We stayed in the glamping tent for $200 a night. My boy scout summer camp tent 50 years ago was nicer. Tent was tiny, with hard, steel frame beds, a small table, a small chair. I guess they thought it was luxurious because they provided electric blankets that shut off randomly during the night, causing you to wake up shivering and forcing you to get it restarted. Pushing the 8 hour sleep button did nothing to help this. The only place to plug in my CPAP and phone chargers was an outlet strip zip tied to the bedframe UNDER the bed. Our friends stayed in a cabin and a lodge room, each more outrageously priced and underwhelming. The bright stars of the place were the restaurant and the snack bar. Great food and service. It is in a beautiful location across from Ano Nuevo and is wooded and has lots of trails to beaches and woods. Family friendly with playground and activities for kids. Just way too expensive for the accommodations.",

The line got longer and he sat and stared. When it was my turn, to checkin, the women was rude and dismissive to my questions.  I also had a campground spot reserved and apparently the resort has a lot of rules but enforces none of them.   For Example the campground does not allow music outside campers, which is fine and also quiet hour is from 10 pm to 9 am - however I would then think that the children who were playing the accordion and using a pogo stick at 730 am would be a no-no, but apparently if security just drove by these cuties and their parents who were up the ring about 5 spots. The children played everywhere but in front of their campers.  I would not go back due to the rudeness of the front desk staff in the lodge and lack of enforcing rules.   I don t want to listen to somebody else s children at 730 am.",

        "ReviewContent": "Nice location, long walk to beach across a highway. Clean restrooms. Absolutely zero internet or cell signal. They have nonexistent WiFi. My family was only ever able to connect to WiFi in the restaurant and only one bar. Not a massive deal but we like to stream tv at night and that did not happen. As everything else in the area everything closes early. We planned on eating at the grill on Monday but turned out they closed mondays?? Oh and this is a massive party spot. The people at the end of our row partied till after midnight and were screaming and cussing at the security guard. They were very drunk. They must host weddings or parties in the lodge because there was a huge crowd and loud music going late. Seemed like a nice place to go get together with friends and be loud and crazy. But not if you are looking to spend a few quiet nights. The employees were amazing. I had booked three nights but because availability I had one spot for 2 nights and 1 day in another. When I arrived I was told they had moved things around so I would not have to change spots. That was awesome!",

Good: lawn area, reasonably flat, tent could be attached easily and well, we were there in strong winds and still you didnt notice much there, everything was neatly clean, fireplace space and free firewood were very cool. You can also have a good conversation with other people there. Only one shower each for women and men, but they werent often occupied. There was also a dry sweat lodge. Restaurant and grocery store are on site. You can hardly hear the highway. Bad: actually just the price, I still think 50 dollars per night is quite a lot for 2 people. However, it will of course be cheaper if you travel with large groups. I think a campsite is designed for 3 tents and 6 people, maybe more.",

        "ReviewContent": "The Costanoa/Santa Cruz North KOA is the 64th stop and we stayed for 7 nights. If you are on a tight budget or looking to save money, this is not the place for you and is the most expensive park for us to date. But I have to say that this is one of the best KOAs we have stayed so far. Just over an hour from San Francisco and 25 minutes from Santa Cruz, you are in an idyllic setting about a quarter mile off the Pacific Coast Highway and have views and sounds of the ocean from the park. Older growth pine and eucalyptus trees, great landscaping, coastal trails, light houses, and a myriad of activities for families (on the weekend off-season). Sites are nicely laid out and there is space between you and your neighbor. Some nice grass areas including the dog park. Initially, leveling was an issue as it was off 4 degrees to the front of the rig. Have not used the facilities other than the washer/dryers   only knock is how few there are. Have not interacted with many of the staff but the registration couple is friendly and the maintenance staff and house keeping always smile and wave. Would recommend this park and rate it a 4.5. The public wifi was weak except mid-day. During peak times, it was a struggle to pull up emails and basic social media. There is no T-Mobile service at all. Verizon 3.4 down/0.1 up at 5:45 pm. WiFi 0.74 down 0.14 up. For streaming, used a Verizon jet pack with an antennae booster and worked adequately.",

        "ReviewContent": "Oh man. Third is tough.  The KOA itself is amazing. We came out from Denver and ended up getting a cabin and a camp site. The father in law had the camp site while the kids and I had the cabin. What ever you do, do not drive across the KOA to offload the family unless you want the security on you about having 2 vehicles at a camp site. I understand that you are trying to maintain a great property but my 2 kids are under 4 y/o but when I cant even drop the kids off without being harassed, it took the vibe right away. Then security was giving a friend of ours a hard time about his converted camper. They questioned whether it was a true camper. It was, they eventually let him in. Then, the next morning, wouldnt you know it, good ol security came cruising up in their fancy little security golf cart and started harassing our friend AGAIN asking if it was a legitimate camper. Come on, he already checked in and went through one rough of what felt like interrogations, now he had to go through it a second time. I would love to come back again, but the way security had it out for our group, we will be passing by and not stopping. Sad because it is such a great property.",

We had a premium tent site and it barely fit 3 tents super close together. Super slim/small tent sites. The women s bathrooms were disgusting a lot of the time, unfortunately. We also had a bike stolen. And the night after, a neighbor had one stolen as well. Seems common for here and the staff should advertise this!! All they did was tell us to fill out a useless report.

        "ReviewContent": "My family visited the Costano campsite on the third leg of our 10-day family camping adventure.  The grounds were beautiful, the amenities were great, and most of the service was excellent.  However, the camp security came to our campsite multiple times per day and at night checking on us and remind us that quiet time will begin at 10 pm. In addition, while packing to leave, a man visited our campsite three separate times.  Once to check if fire ash had been removed and remind us to return the fire pit to its original location next to the picnic table, it would be too much for his wife to manage.   Then again, to remind us to reposition the picnic tables back in the original position and to verify if we had an elbow to connect to the RV to the dump.   The constant oversight and monitoring of my family ruined our camping experience at this lovely location.",

The reason I didnt give it 5 stars was the Wi-Fi was bad. Couldnt really watch anything streaming. I recommend installing some more hotspots to improve this.

If youre tent camping and looking for privacy- that backwoods experience- this isnt for you, ha! But it was fun for our family to switch it up. We stayed in a premium tent site - mostly gated grass pad that holds 4 spacious sites with fire pits, however fires were not allowed the days we went. We got a text daily letting us know if we could start a fire or not. We had three young kids with us and our 1 year old stayed within the boundaries of the grass pad well so we appreciated the gate. It does keep you feeling a bit more private from the road, too. Its close to two bathrooms, as well. We will pick the same spot, returning next year. Beautiful and fun!",

Plus they have growlers and you can sit At a table while the kids play a huge size connect four game!! The showers were clean. The power was not working in the bathroom so I couldn t blow dry my hair. But I left my Lights on and ran my battery dead so when I went to go leave I had to get a jump and was really grateful to the maintenance guys who were able to bring around jump cables!! It s a bit of a walk to the beach but well worth it!! I would drive if you are taking little kids though that is a crazy street to try and cross!",

We stayed in the premium first loop and the sites were truly exceptional with pavers in the patio area, excellent quality outdoor furniture, raised fire pit, landscaping, etc.   Hiking trails to the beach areas are superb.  When on the beaches, particularly during weekdays, we had them to ourselves. A+   //  Cons:  Very expensive.  You also must be prepared to leave your ego at the door...there are extensive rules that never end and are enforced making one feel less than human/frustrated at times.  Most staff are generally nice but some treat you like just an annoying RV-er with average at best intelligence.  At all times it felt like one had to walk on eggshells.  I will add that COVID challenges may be adding to this, but it also is clear that this is the culture at this establishment.  - Overall, likely will visit again in the future given the Pros above, but will not be rushing back given the noted Cons.",

A woman across from our RV site stood on her deck with her cell phone and stared hostilely at us.  She seemed to have no other interest but to stare at us. We left to escape her intrusive gaze and when 6 of us returned at 8:30 this woman actually got out of bed and turned on her lights to watch us.  We were informed by a worker whose voice shook that she is an owner of the campground. There was no RV water connection in the $135/night site and no working toilet nearby. Signs said there was fecal bacteria in the water and in an  abundance of caution  they recommended we not drink the water!  Not a nice place at all.",

Its absolutely beautiful and we had a fantastic view of the ocean from our site and a large grass area. The campground has tent bungalows, cabins and RV sites (both pull through and back in w/ full hook ups). Booking a reservation was easy and fast via their website and check in was as smooth as can be. The staff was friendly and helpful. The General Store was open as well as the Cascade Restaurant and Bar for take out orders due to Covid-19. The beach is across the street/highway and walking distance (keep an eye out for snakes). There are also many hiking trails and a few bike trails near by, as well as some sightseeing. The Pigeon Point Lighthouse isnt far and a nice drive (be sure to check hours if you plan to visit). The only thing we disliked was the poor cell service and WiFi. We have both Verizon and T-Mobile. We were unable to send or receive network calls, but if near the General Store and restaurant, you may be able to make a WiFi call, check email and so on. In all, we had a great stay and were here for 2 nights. I am sure we will be back in the future!",

However you can walk to a hot spot for limited service. Second, we were surrounded by 5 RVs of family and friends that partied loudly all day and night. No way to call front desk to complain and no one patrolling to quiet them down. That was a HUGE distraction from the beautiful beach view and potential peacefulness.",

Bathrooms super super clean, showers hot and stag very friendly. The only thing I d query is the restaurant and why you d have a really expensive white linen restaurant in an RV park? We deliberately picked this park for our first night so we d be able to eat as we wouldn t have our bearings yet (weren t even sure if we would have been able to buy food that first day due to timing) so were really shocked to see the prices on the menu. I guess I should have checked beforehand (rookie mistake). Food WAS amazing but it felt weird to sit in camping clothes in such a fancy place and we blew out food budget out a bit too soon .... so check the menu online or take your own food.

The security came to us this morning (he was very nice) but said that we weren t allowed to camp here because we have a roof top tent (pop up tent) because This KOA is concerned about their image, so they don t allow pop up tents. We were told if the security had been working last night when we came in we would have been denied access to camp ground. We paid $52.00 for a parking spot and a table. I would definitely not recommend this KOA strictly on the fact that they are concerned about their IMAGE - No thanks!",

Expect to spend all you time behind the trailer. You could even see the ocean from the spots. There is beach access, but it is a bit of a hike and you have to cross HW1 which can feel like a game of Frogger at times but was easy when we crossed. The warming stations were nice and the bathrooms were clean.   It is a bit pricey as far as campgrounds go. Staff meet all of the comments below.

The staff when reserving was friendly and helpful. The bad: the spaces are narrow, we couldnt fully extend our awning with out running into our neighbor. Ticks, within an hour of being there we found a tick on us. SKUNKS...after dark the skunks start coming out all over the place. My husband was walking on the grass belt back to our trailer and got sprayed. No one seems to care about it. The staff...not helpful. When asked about whether they were serving food...the response I dont know. If you are wait staff shouldnt you be able to answer this basic question?

When we came back and checked in, we were told there would be an additional $10 conservation fee charged to our account. When we received the electronic receipt, it showed a $5 conservation fee and a $5 pet fee. The RV sites are very close together. There is a bathroom for each section of the camp, but it only has one shower a piece for men and women. The beach is a fair hike away, across highway 1, and down a cliff. The WiFi signal was non existent. There was a very long list of regulations backed up with threats of charging $150 to a credit card if any of them are broken.

        "ReviewContent": "What a hidden gem along the coast! It s the fanciest RV park I ve ever stayed at! The entire area resembles a garden, and the facilities are impeccably maintained, clean, and functional. However, there are two basic things that could easily be improved to enhance the guest experience. Firstly, providing a better power strip with a few more plugs for charging, and secondly, changing the shower head to increase water pressure. I love the bungalow we stayed in; it was neat and cozy. I could barely hear the waves from the ocean. Nearby activities: Accessing the beach is easy with a pleasant hiking trail, surrounded by numerous other trails. Despite being right next to California 1, it s remarkably quiet.",

        "ReviewContent": "I tend to stay away from business reviews, but as a local on the Pescadero Coast, I cant avoid leaving a review for this spot. First, know that Pescadero is remote. As such, Costanoa has a monopoly on goods and services. Expect 5-star prices for 1-star goods and services. Cascade Restaurant is a circus of untrained clowns: metal shavings in food, cheese wrappers on burgers, wrong orders, and routinely under-cooked and over-cooked food are the norm. Youll take your wrong orde and like it. Costanoa buys cheep eggs from Oregon, and chicken off a box truck rather than from the best farms literally across the street. They advertise as local and seasonal, but dont support either one. They resent the local community but portray themselves as integral members. This location could absolutely be a 5-star location. But they are 1-star owners with 0-star service. What they need to improve is obvious, but the owners are too cheep and egotistical to do it. Its a sad place on beautiful grounds. Enjoy it at your own risk.",

        "ReviewContent": "My friend flew in from Alaska and our other friend met us here to celebrate her 35th birthday. It was stunning and we were so excited to celebrate and enjoy the property. We went to dinner and told the restaurant it was my friends 35th in our reservation and no one aknowledged it, however, sang and brought a candle lit dessert to the table next to us. They began vacuuming while we ate our dessert 30 minutes before closing... we promptly left. We went back to our cabin and suddenly the power went out. We shivered all night and had no power to charge our phones and no way to read our books. We spoke with management in the morning and they said power would be back by 2pm. So we left to find some coffee and kill time to stay warm and dry until then. We returned at 1:30 to be told that now the power wouldnt be on until 8pm. The Yoga that was scheduled and included was cancelled. We had to cancel our friends birthday massage as well since there was no way to heat the towels/room etc. They let us cancel our 2nd night without a fee but would not give us any sort of discount on our initial night. We spent nearly $300 to freeze all night and spend no time on the property doing the stated activities. I would have given this place another try, however without giving us any sort of reimbursement or even a little empathy, I wont be back. The staff was cold and short with us. It was just a really sad trip and Im sorry I took my friends here. Id highly recommend having a back up plan if youre planning on giving this place a shot.",

        "ReviewContent": "Fantastic! Friendly staff! Wonderful nature-filled resort! Yes, RESORT! It balances nature and comfort with activities, family-friendly hospitality, and beautiful sunsets and stargazing! Sure, its a little pricey, but its worth it. Had to leave a day early because my family member got injured and they refunded us the last day! So wonderful! Will come back. Right on the beach and just a short drive from stores. Its almost as if we were living in a small town with their own restaurant and store right in the KOA! Thank you!",

        "ReviewContent": "This is a private KOA campground. Although it is in a beautiful location and well maintained, it is totally overpriced. We got the glamping tent cabin at $200 a night. It wasnt as good as my boy scout summer camp tent from 50 years ago. See pics. It was tiny, had 2 hard, steel frame beds, a beat up small wooden table and a beat up small wooden chair for a place that can sleep 3. There were 2 Adirondack chairs and a picnic table outside. Its one claim to luxury was it had electric blankets, which shut off randomly during the night waking you up freezing cold. Had to restart each one 2-3 times a night. Hitting the 8 hour night button had no effect on either one. The only place to plug in my CPAP and phone chargers was an outlet strip zip tied to bedframe UNDER THE BED. Our friends got a cabin and a room in the lodge at $350 and $500 a night. These are 5 diamond prices for 2-3 star accommodations. The good news was the restaurant and snack bar were excellent. We ate and drank very well. It is quite beautiful and had great hiking in woods and to beaches. Very kid friendly big playground and lots of activities for them too. It was not worth it to me, but it is close to San Francisco and was almost full, so it is worth it for some people.",
