Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 22, 2024","Went to an Alice Glass concert here, and immediately loved this place. Its a small-to-medium sized venue that feels like a just right balance between low-key and intimate, while having enough space to not feel claustrophobic or uncomfortable. Drink prices were reasonable, and we also appreciated that there is some seating upstairs that still provides a view of the show."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 15, 2024",Security over aggressive over people leaving that old bouncer need to retire before he gets hurt
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 08, 2024",This venue is great. One of the better sounding shows I have ever been to. The drinks are very reasonably priced for a dedicated venue and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Went on 3/5/24 to see Mclusky and they were amazing and sounded great.  Easy to get to from Bart and has a nice upstairs balcony area with a small amount of seating.

Rickshaw Stop,"Feb 29, 2024",Wanna be  is the only vibe coming from this club Id rather not come back here. Most of the staff will threaten you thinking their drugs is what keep the place alive. Avoid this trash place like a plague. Wish cops would shut it down.
Rickshaw Stop,"Feb 29, 2024",One of the cooler small venues in the city. Just be aware that cell service often dies within the venue so youll need to make texts/calls outside.

Rickshaw Stop,"Dec 29, 2023","My kid wanted to go to a show here, and it said the performance time was 7-9 pm. Wrong! Doors didnt OPEN until 7, the opening act( didnt say there was one! ) didnt start until 8, show wasnt over until 10.  Not doing another concert here until theyre older."

Rickshaw Stop,"Nov 29, 2023","Though I loved being at the front and being so intimate with one of my favorite artists, the security told me to take it down a notch after one of the first songs. The thing is, the artist played her most popular songs in the beginning, so of course Id be a bit energetic for this... anyways, I dont blame the security guards themselves- they were cool. Just think that wasnt necessary."
Rickshaw Stop,"Nov 29, 2023",Love the staff the venue and the vibes!  Fun spot easy to get to.

Rickshaw Stop,"Oct 29, 2023","Saw a few of my favorite bands. Including girl in a coma, k. Flay, and Your Smith. Got to meet the band members every time. I always enjoy this venue. I go for the drink specials...best for the price so far, in my opinion. Update, I just saw g. Flip there and they were amazing !"

Rickshaw Stop,"Jul 29, 2023","A classic venue to see indie bands. Good bar and staff. Sound can be a bit off sometimes, depends on the band. Acts go on quite late for us oldies."
Rickshaw Stop,"Jul 29, 2023","Friendly staff, good sound quality. I took a star off for their lack of bourbon choices and the bathroom, while functional and *relatively* clean, is a bit musty due to lack of air circulation."
Rickshaw Stop,"Jul 29, 2023","They wouldnt open the doors until the DJs were ready or 20 minutes after scheduled start time. They dont offer drink tickets along with the entry fee. The service fee if you buy tickets online is too high and it is not worth it, better buying at the door. Doesnt seem they had food to order there. There was a minor water leak in the ceiling in the dance floor area that occasionally dripped with noticeable water on the floor.  The decor looked rather old and the second floor was closed off for unknown reasons. The DJ song selection was somewhat poor and very obscure, not playing any of the commercial hits (in regards to the italo-disco event)."
Rickshaw Stop,"Jul 29, 2023","Great little cozy music venue to listen to small bands on tour. Their bar is small, but the serve a mean cocktail. Pricing is more than fair. Check out their website. You d be surprised whose playing."

Rickshaw Stop,"May 29, 2023","The place itself is a bit... dingy - often crowded, dark, not the best service at the bar, etc - but they do have really interesting events with eclectic themes, so worth keeping an eye on their calendar."

Small club, relaxed vibe, with excellent artists coming through. Ive only been for one show, but I absolutely intend to visit more. Parking sucks in the area. Either use rideshare or mass transit, or be prepared to pay at least $20, IF you can find an open lot nearby."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2023","The Rickshaw is my favorite venue in the city. Great staff, drink prices that remain reasonable, and always the kind of place to catch an up-and-coming band or and old favorite as they make it through San Francisco. Been there dozens of times and will many more before my showgoing years are through"

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2023","Staff was really rude.The short one with tattoos and short brown hair is extremely rude and strict. She would just chill in the bathroom waiting to get someone in trouble. I was dancing on stage with a huge crowd, they came up to me personally and said I needed to get down and cannot be up there right now then left. Everyone else stayed on stage. Later in the night people started to get on stage again and so I went up to her and asked and she said oh yeah they are letting them do that now. Ridiculous and rude. Literally go to any other club."

The place has a neat little balcony area and two bars, cant complain about where its located either. The staff are always chill and the events are a blast   great sound system, lights, aesthetic. It does get humid like crazy in there with enough bodies, only downside, and even then its ignorable with in/out access."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2022",Not a great experience. Staff was way too strict and made everyone feel unwelcome from the second we stepped in line. Made the experience super stressful and not fun and took away from the music. Seemed like they wanted to make it hard to have fun. Wouldn t recommend going here pick another concert somewhere else!

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2020",One of the classiest hole in the walls San Francisco has to offer!
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2020","The venue is great for a small SRO show. They have a second floor balcony with minimal seating. The acoustics are acceptable. They have a bar and serve alcohol. Depending on the headliner, it gets crowded. Very intimate stage. Its SF so the parking is non-existent aside from a few lots around the corner ranging from $10-25."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2020","I came to Rickshaw Stop to see Fakear. Ive been to Rickshaw stop back when I was 18 years old, and the event for Fakear was also 18 and over. It was good to see that this venue still hosts a nice and safe place for young adults. The drinks here are also priced reasonably and the venue has a lot of space.

Staff were really cool and the overall atmosphere was amazing. Even amidst the mosh pit everyone made sure if someone fell down they would help them up and wipe up spilled drinks so no one would slip. Opened my eyes to a new genre of music. Would definitely repeat had a blast. 20$ cover at the door and drinks were generally 10$.

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2020",Popscenes (thrusday night parties at Rickshaw Stop) are some of the best parties in town to discover new and upcoming music. Hosted by Aaron Axelson of Live105 and full of young hipsters looking for an affordable party. Tickets usually cost 12-15 bucks and drinks aint too bad for SF. Venue is small but intimate. Muse had their first SF show at this venue and ive seen countless SF debuts over the years. 18 and over. Pleanty of parking in the area at night.

The only issues  that I had was the sound was all over the place with instruments sounds a lot louder than others etc. Also the show started an hour after expected which sucks to just be standing there not seeing who you came to see. Pretty standard for a lot of venues though so this place is cheap and fun, go see a band you know there and get close like I did."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2019","Cool venue, I guess. I like the couches. Not sure why the bartender charged me $13 for my $5 bottle of beer, though (and the bar was WAY too loud and crowded to try and argue/discuss my tab, so I just paid and left). It also took forever to get in. Doors opened *after* 9:00 + just one ID checker for a fairly long line of people + a wristband + a wrist stamp... I remember enjoying a show at Rickshaw Stop in 2010, but I might avoid it from now on. :/"

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2019","Rickshaw Stop has an awesome lineup of bands--both well-known and lesser-known--which is awesome! It has a fun, small-venue feel. Because it is relatively long and narrow, though, the stage can be difficult to see. Also, Im not sure if its a general rule or just the concert I saw (Im leaning towards the latter), but the crowd seemed more rude than average. There were chains of people pushing their way through the crowd mid-concert into pockets that didnt exist. I wasnt even halfway to the stage, either! Anyway, good music but not great building layout."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2019",We went to this venue to see Larkin Poe. We love this Duo and were pleasantly surprised how up close and personal we were able to get. The Acoustics were wonderful and everybody could see well especially from the floor. It took a while for the bar to open but that probably was because we did the early bird tour which cost a little bit extra but we got to meet the musicians in person and got a signed poster. There was beer on tap that was passable and mixed drinks which we theres also self-serve water which was excellent and I think every venue should have. I couldnt believe how inexpensive the tickets would have been otherwise. The main difficulty for me was finding parking but I wouldnt expect otherwise in a big city. So Id say find a show you like and go!

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2019",One of my favorite venues in SF for seeing both local and touring musical acts.

There was a good view of the band even if you weren t right in front. There were couches and seating upstairs and a few seats to the side on the main floor. We dubbed that the  Moms club  as there were about 8 moms sitting waiting for their teens. We took BART in to SF and walked to The Rickshaw Stop. It was quiet late when we got out so we called an Uber to take us back to the station. Was only $10. It was a really fun night."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2018","I love this venue. Came to see mild high club, great, very comfortable . Nice couch section upstairs. Dim lighting. Coat rack, no one is watching your stuff, Im sure it would have been safe to use but I dont trust my favorite jacket to be safe in San Francisco. I walked up and down the stairs many times. One of my favorite shows!!!!!!!! As an introvert, this is one of the few venues I felt at ease at. Definitely one of my favorite venues in San Francisco."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2018","Great bar, good stage, lights and potential but the engineer had the levels up so high that the band Id waited months to hear just sounded like an unintelligible roar. Super disappointing. Just because the gain goes to ten doesnt mean it belongs at ten."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2018",Cool venue but I was pretty turned off on my recent visit that the box office was cash only and the bar has a $20 credit minimum. I spent all my cash on my ticket but wasnt going to drink enough to charge any drinks so I just didnt get any (more their loss than mine).

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2018","Great venue to get up close with artists. However, the bouncer was exceedingly rude to me and made me pull up my facebook, a credit card, and an insurance card JUST to prove my id. Ive never gotten trouble like this at other concert venues."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2017",Ive been to Nerd Nite a few times and had a great time. It would be nice if they put out more chairs during such shows. There doesnt seem to be any reason not to have a few more to prevent forcing people to sit on the floor. Otherwise a great venue. Looking forward to checking out music shows as well.

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2017",
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2017","One of my top five venues to catch a live show. Plus, Aaron Axelsen spins here all the time so its also a great place for (alternative, electronic, indie) dancing. People are cool, theres never drama, and no one is ever looking you up and down or judging your outfit."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2017","Best place to see up and coming bands in a intimate venue,. Excellent programming."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2016","This place is crazy. If its your scene, Im sure youll love it. We always seem to end up here on 18+ nights and teens are just too much. Ive literally seen people having sex while dancing in the middle of the crowd and while thats impressive, I dont want to see it. Most people here dance around in their underwear or less, and again thats fine if youre into it, but it wasnt what I was expecting. I just want future patrons to have a heads up about what they might experience here."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2016","Great venue with fun special events. The venue has a stage, main floor area, a bar and bathrooms on the first floor. There is also a second floor with another bar and coat check area, along with a balcony overlooking the first floor ."

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2016",I saw a band here and the place was packed even though it was Tuesday. This place is small and bare bones but the bartenders are NICE and even the bouncers are NICE.  I dont know if this is normal for San Francisco because I am used to Vancouver bars where the staff are complete douches. They also had decent food which is unusual for a bar.

Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2015",
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2015","It might have been because Rickshaw was spacious and I had the ability to walk around without bumping into anyone or the fact that all 51 of me got to stand on a table so I could get an unobstructed view of the headliner (something Im not used to at all), but Im a fan of this place!  Its got a backyard patio feel to it with the lights hung on the ceiling and an upstairs balcony with adequate seating if you dont want to deal with the mosh pit that downstairs will eventually become. My only gripe about it was that it got very stuffy and hazey.  But I guess thats to be expected when everyones jumping up and down, dancing.  Overall, a good time!"
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014",
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014","Between Nerd Nite and live music, Ive been at Rickshaw quite a bit lately.  Its a great little place, awesome for live music, good (strong) drinks, and sometimes pop-up food options upstairs."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014",sort of funky layout but they usually have great bands on the bill that are sort of on the fringe of success. Not the best view from upstairs but they do have skee-ball and a foosball table if you are not quite feeling the opening acts.
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014","The bar area takes quite a bit of time to get a drink, the venue is pretty small. Its best to come early so that you have a good spot somewhere in the front if youre like me. Other than that, this venue is quite small, the sound is amazing, and theres a meet and greet after shows."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014",Awesome music venue. Perfect size to see a semi famous band.
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014",Saw Robert Delong here and the atmosphere was great. Smaller venue but great staff and decent amount of top level seating. One of the better smaller venues I have been to for bands.
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2014",
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013",Nice club. Intimate vibe and they usually book well known artists. Lighting and production needs help though. Bar is ok...
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013","This review is for the Cockblock event on 2nd Saturdays This place is fun until it becomes makeout session after 1am. By that time, I am ready to go. * Also, watch out for slippery floors. It seems to be a common thing to drop your drinks on the dance floor, especially in the MIDDLE of the dance floor. Avoid wearing open-toed shoes."
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013",
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013",Went to a show two nights ago (The Knocks) and really liked the venue. Its has a really nice size for semi-popular bands and artists that dont attract the huge masses. There is a balcony area which is open to anyone (at least this was the case at the concert I went to). Would love to see another show there.
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013","I saw Shiny Toy Guns here. I liked being able to sit down up in the balcony to watch the opening bands. My only beef with the venue is making people stand out in the rain with a fairly inefficient door process, otherwise, this is a great place to see a show!"
Rickshaw Stop,"Mar 29, 2013","A great, small intimate space that tends to have a good crowd lacking pretension (something unusual for venues these days). Drinks are well priced, lineups tend to be good, and everyone seems to have a good time when there."

They have a nice balcony which can seat <20 people, so get there early if thats your thing. Walking distance to Hayes Valley bars/restaurants. I went with my wife to Sugar Bar before the show for a quick drink, just for a change of scenery."
