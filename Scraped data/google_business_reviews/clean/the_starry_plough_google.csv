The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2023","I have been to The Starry Plough Pub during several Saint Patricks Day Celebrations. This is an Irish bar with reasonable prices (for this day and age). I was able to find a dry cider--yum! What a celebration this 2023 Saint Paytrick Day was!!! It was standing room only. They had Irish bands, Irish dancers, and it was an open mike for singing Irish songs. They offer foods like Corned Beef and Cabbage, Fish and Chips, and Bacon Cheseburger, but we had dinner before going there. They looked good, though. The Starry Plough is a hangout for Irish and Irish wanna bes. They have live music, Irish music, and even Irish dancing."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2023","I normally love this place however with that being said, I would suggest if you go here that you bring cash... this is the 3 or 4 time that my card has been charged more than once for dinner.. it seems like they need more training on how to use there POS system. It is quite upsetting to have money clear your bank that wasnt spent $73 is a good amount of money to have charged someone twice by accident.. so now I got through the process again on disputing charges with my bank.... la-sigh. I really do like this place though just will never use a bank or credit card here again.."
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2023",This place is so cool. Very inviting and fun as hell. We also enjoyed the garlic fries and wings as we waited for the show to start. We are definitely going back.

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2022","Very cool place. Met and befriended a physicist there who went by the name of Photon. Miss you, guy...I think you were on the right track with your mathematics. Hope to come back to The Starry Plough one Thursday and dance to funk, once its finally possible again."
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2022","I hate to have to leave this safe space a terrible review, especially if it s the only one star review. Not saying that the behavior of an employee defines the business, but my experience there was terrible when I went there with my older sister and some friends back in June 2015. I have been having trouble finding the bar, but I remember how it looks like and I just found it, so here it goes: I am a vegan, and employees in this restaurant won t give a single hoot accidentally fooling a vegan. Hecks, they didn t even apologize! I asked for a vegan burger, and then I either asked if the cheese or if everything is vegan, and the lady said yes. Then I noticed mayonnaise. I asked the male employee if the mayonnaise in the vegan burger is vegan and if the cheese and bun is vegan, he said no. Then they were taking a while to remake it, and then the guy just jumped to saying that they don t swap it for another order and that they give no refund, and that they re not like McDonald s giving the refund and it seems like they reserve the right to refuse checking for the ingredient. Safe space? When they fool someone with food allergens, they will be shown to not be that much of a food allergen friendly area on the news. Maybe they already did, which is maybe the reason why they are temporarily closed! Vegans, do yourself a favor and do not come to this restaurant when they reopen. They will most likely not give a single hoot about your diet and will fool/fraud you. Just because this place is a safe space for LGBTQ, it doesn t give them any more right than others (not the special exemption) to fool vegans. Just a note, veganism is not the same exact same thing as vegetarianism, and chances are if someone is trying to order something vegan, they are vegan, so don t play any bets with feeding them non-vegan stuff. Is Berkeley not supposed to be a progressive city? This business has shown that it doesn t belong in Berkeley, nor in California, nor in the United States, nor in any republic or democratic nation."
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2022","My ex used to work here and its awesome. The thing I miss about my ex, is when she worked here!!! Lamo"

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2021","I saw the Nels Cline Singers/Scott Amendola here a few times back in the early 2000s. Cool, intimate venue to watch amazing artists do their thing. Nels Cline even signed a The Giant Pin poster for me and I didnt even ask him to do that! How cool is that? Ive tried to add a photo of the Nels signed poster but its not letting me. Oh well."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2020",My home because I usually dont go to bars but this place is community. I first discovered the live Irish music sessions on sundays and later the Irish ceili dancing. I dont miss a week of dancing when i have time. Great selection of drinks. Im not much of a drinker but it goes great with the pub and social atmosphere. The food here is okay. There was only one time when the corned beef sandwich had enough vinegar and it was bliss. All the other times it was a bit off. Other foods like the mac and cheese is nice and same with the potatoes. My palate gets tired and theh put a lot of salt where I usually am minimal with salt
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2020","Friendly but very slow staff. Food is serviceable. Music performances are lovely. 2019/09 update: - the staff is still very friendly and I like them quite a bit. +1 more star for their world class vegetarian burger. The chef that created it, Alura, is a local. The aioli is stellar, and the patty definitely craveworthy."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2020",Favorite place to goon Sunday (sing-a-long) or Monday (Irish dancing) nights. Family owned and operated (always someone there related to the owner). Nice verity of beers on tap. Food is pretty good and not over priced. Recommend the roasted green salad or any of the burgers.

The beer stays varied and delicious with a few simple wines to compliment as well. The menu is a tasty Irish blend of satisfying pub food from cheesy pulled pork fries all the way to Shepards pie! The weekly events are a must see as well! There is always something every day, but the one that keeps me coming back is the Berkely Poetry Slam on Wednesday nights!  Stumbling into the Starry Plough was one the homiest places Ive walked into since I moved here 7 years ago."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2019","If a jig is your dance, this is your floor. This place is hopping all week long and some nights have a cover$$, so check the schedule! Live, traditional music, open mics, poetry slams, touring guests, and their house sound engineers know their craft! Ive never been blasted out of the room there, or had to reach for my earplugs   regardless of the performers  which is the hallmark of a great live performance venue, but still seems to be a very rare treat to find. They also have a limited but excellent kitchen. The Shepherds Pie is worth a Sunday or Monday visit. (But bring your own HP sauce!? ;)) Beer, wine, cider and hot and cold non-alcoholic beverages are available and the staff always makes you feel welcome. I love this place. Its easy to feel enough at peace here, to let your heart sing and your spirit dance for a few hours. If traditional Gaelic and Celtic music is in your blood (or youre just curious enough to seek out a local, live performance) theres few places in all of California, that are better than The Starry Plough."

I was told - repeatedly - by other patrons that all the food was amazing, but I can only speak to the great cheeseburger (perfectly cooked, slightly pink in the middle) and fries I ate. About 20 taps or so, 8 on rotation including a cider in each. Definitely a spot for locals, show up early for a good seat at the bar on Mondays - the free Irish dancing is led by a 6 piece flute, string and percussion band with rotating members. Plenty of friendly women and men who enjoy showing new dancers the ropes."
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2019","Went there to a Poetry Slam to support my son who was the *sacrificial poet* *Prophet* *night, and I had a great time  they serve a variety of good food and big portions  just tell them lite salt on the fries... very friendly atmosphere, they had dart boards there that was awesome to watch people play,  one of the cooks was also a poet, and the hostess at the bar(Jenna) was awesome and made us feel at home,  she was a great help as Im disable and was a1st timer in there. I definately recommend as you will get your belly full and enjoy the 1st Wednesday nights of the month *New Shit Show* introducing 1st time poetry pieces & poets     as well as seasoned poets..."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2019","Anyone can be comfortable at The Starry Plough either alone or with a group because if youre alone, youll soon be yakking with a group between the songs and comedy routines (or during).  I go there Tuesday nights when audience members who want to get used to being performers, can.  But, many others are already on tour as was Laryssa Birdseye and her drummer who I happen to plop down next to.  And everyone else in between is enabled to do what they do in an accepting atmosphere (usually).  IFK you want to eat, the food is delicious, although I cant see how any one can eat a half-foot-high hamburger with dignity.  I live for the bread pudding topped with ice cream thats drizzled with a design of heavenly chocolate sauce.  My mouth is watering for it now. Even their 5-scoop bowl of ice cream, sauce and nuts is worth waiting for while enduring a dirty comedy routine."

I am new as a visitor to this establishment, but very much appreciate its long timeline in the community via my friends and co-workers over the years. I was there on a Tuesday evening - open mic night was coming up and the regulars who invited me cautioned me it could get loud and conversation less easy after about 7:30 (live music is also featured). They have a kitchen and I hear the food is good but I notice most of the patrons seem to be putting their coin into drink, just the kind of balance one might expect in a good pub. I liked being in the midst of a widely mixed group of folks, very Berkeley; old school a bit in the vibe as the roots go back to at least the 60s."

The corned beef and cabbage is to die for, but is only available on certain days. They routinely have music and dancing (check out their monthly calendar online). Lots of taps, smiles, and laughs. Also, they have darts!"

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2018","When the owners  son pins you out of a packed crowd as a newcomer, makes a point of topping you off and hands you a freshly printed calendar of events, you know you re in the right spot. 33yr old bars are not what I d call run of the mill, and the food, poetry slam, and service did not strike me as such either. Will be back soon."
The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2018","Came for the dancing and music, stayed for... the dancing and music... and the BREAD PUDDING. The bread pudding is ridiculously rich and comes with ice cream on top. The garlic fries are also delicious. The Starry Plough is a jewel in Berkeleys crown."

The Starry Plough Pub,"Mar 29, 2018","Barely qualifies as an Irish pub. ONE Irish beer (Guinness). Irish music sessions on Sundays do provide Irish music, but the band is a crowd of 20 or so amateur musicians, and it only takes one or two of them to be out of tune or off rhythm to make it baaaddd Irish music.  Walls are festooned with sayings and pictures of heroes of the Irish resistance like...Che Guevara?!?  On the plus side, the burgers are very good and and there are vegetarian options.  The sad thing is this could be a 5-star Irish pub if they just put more Irish beers and food on the menu, took down the Che poster, and insisted on the band auditioning its members."

Furthermore you have to love the sweet selections of themed nights that are much more engaging than the typical BS. But wait, theres more: lets talk about the glorious bar grub, it drips in deliciousness--need I say more? Then there is the classic darts and bar games if you get bored. Definitely a cool authentic crowd with exciting diversity. Only suggestion is that they smuggle Jameson & Baileys in on St. Patricks Day, and build a roof deck (although an elaborate cavern might be more fitting)... Cheers!"

Took $ from the ATM (which only gives 20s) to pay for my friend to get in, the door person insisted it was a 10 even after I pointed out that I just took the $ from the ATM which only gives 20s and so I spoke with the manger who told me they only check the cameras if I file a police report.  After contacting Berkeley PD, called them to try and work it out without wasting public $ and time and the person who answered the phone mocked me and dared me to bring the police .  Police report filed, never going back here again, avoid them like the plague!"
