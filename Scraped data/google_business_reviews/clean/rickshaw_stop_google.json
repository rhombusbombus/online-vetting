Its a small-to-medium sized venue that feels like a just right balance between low-key and intimate, while having enough space to not feel claustrophobic or uncomfortable. Drink prices were reasonable, and we also appreciated that there is some seating upstairs that still provides a view of the show."

The drinks are very reasonably priced for a dedicated venue and the staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Went on 3/5/24 to see Mclusky and they were amazing and sounded great.  Easy to get to from Bart and has a nice upstairs balcony area with a small amount of seating."

The service fee if you buy tickets online is too high and it is not worth it, better buying at the door. Doesnt seem they had food to order there. There was a minor water leak in the ceiling in the dance floor area that occasionally dripped with noticeable water on the floor.  The decor looked rather old and the second floor was closed off for unknown reasons. The DJ song selection was somewhat poor and very obscure, not playing any of the commercial hits (in regards to the italo-disco event)."

The staff are always chill and the events are a blast   great sound system, lights, aesthetic. It does get humid like crazy in there with enough bodies, only downside, and even then its ignorable with in/out access."

It was good to see that this venue still hosts a nice and safe place for young adults. The drinks here are also priced reasonably and the venue has a lot of space. Most importantly its well ventilated!"

Staff were really cool and the overall atmosphere was amazing. Even amidst the mosh pit everyone made sure if someone fell down they would help them up and wipe up spilled drinks so no one would slip. Opened my eyes to a new genre of music. Would definitely repeat had a blast. 20$ cover at the door and drinks were generally 10$."

Hosted by Aaron Axelson of Live105 and full of young hipsters looking for an affordable party. Tickets usually cost 12-15 bucks and drinks aint too bad for SF. Venue is small but intimate. Muse had their first SF show at this venue and ive seen countless SF debuts over the years. 18 and over. Pleanty of parking in the area at night."

Because it is relatively long and narrow, though, the stage can be difficult to see. Also, Im not sure if its a general rule or just the concert I saw (Im leaning towards the latter), but the crowd seemed more rude than average. There were chains of people pushing their way through the crowd mid-concert into pockets that didnt exist. I wasnt even halfway to the stage, either! Anyway, good music but not great building layout."

No more having to go back the next morning to pick it up with a hangover! If you happen to forget to close your tab, they tack on a 20% tip, but Im okay with that because I appreciate their work."

Loud but not kill you ears loud.  Good mixes on all the acts.  Has upstairs lounging area with tables, chairs and a few couches. Parking is interesting. I managed a mere 3 blocks away further down Fell St where I found a nice Thai place to eat dinner before the show"

The Acoustics were wonderful and everybody could see well especially from the floor. It took a while for the bar to open but that probably was because we did the early bird tour which cost a little bit extra but we got to meet the musicians in person and got a signed poster. There was beer on tap that was passable and mixed drinks which we theres also self-serve water which was excellent and I think every venue should have. I couldnt believe how inexpensive the tickets would have been otherwise. The main difficulty for me was finding parking but I wouldnt expect otherwise in a big city. So Id say find a show you like and go!"

There was a good view of the band even if you weren t right in front. There were couches and seating upstairs and a few seats to the side on the main floor. We dubbed that the  Moms club  as there were about 8 moms sitting waiting for their teens. We took BART in to SF and walked to The Rickshaw Stop. It was quiet late when we got out so we called an Uber to take us back to the station. Was only $10. It was a really fun night."

Coat rack, no one is watching your stuff, Im sure it would have been safe to use but I dont trust my favorite jacket to be safe in San Francisco. I walked up and down the stairs many times. One of my favorite shows!!!!!!!! As an introvert, this is one of the few venues I felt at ease at. Definitely one of my favorite venues in San Francisco."

Most people here dance around in their underwear or less, and again thats fine if youre into it, but it wasnt what I was expecting.

Its got a backyard patio feel to it with the lights hung on the ceiling and an upstairs balcony with adequate seating if you dont want to deal with the mosh pit that downstairs will eventually become. My only gripe about it was that it got very stuffy and hazey.  But I guess thats to be expected when everyones jumping up and down, dancing.  Overall, a good time!"
