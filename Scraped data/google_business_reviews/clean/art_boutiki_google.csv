Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Mar 22, 2024","Great live music venue. Saw a show here, first time. We all must support this local gem. Acoustics are awesome. Drink prices are reasonable. Staff is super friendly. Join in!"
Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Mar 08, 2024","This place needs to be known especially for their intimate live music setting it s a hidden gem, that we must expose. Cozy, hospitable, great sound system, and fun atmosphere."
Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Feb 29, 2024",Awesome venue ....great sound and super comfortable
Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Feb 29, 2024","Good venue for local music, think Yoshis with a local emphasis. Its a show style (i.e. seats facing a stage rather than cocktail or restaurant tables). Hard folding chairs with a few leather couches around the perimeter. While I wish the chairs were more comfortable, the fact is there are few places that highlight the music and the musicians.  I will keep coming back for this kind of atmosphere and music talent level."

Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Feb 29, 2024",Balkan Comedy Night was a blast! Perfect size crowd for a relaxing night of comedy. Parking was not as difficult as I expected.
Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Jan 29, 2024","Really neat little venue for live music in San Jose.  This is a very unusual space, with a quirky little shop out front. They sell a broad variety of interesting items,  ranging from comic books to t-shirts, posters and random, humorous curiosities.  Behind the shop is the actual music hall.  This is a cozy little venue that holds maybe 150-200 people. Great sight lines to the stage, which sits in front of a wall covered by hundreds of really cool album covers. They have an excellent variety of beers available from local breweries like Almanac and Drakes. There is also a tiny kitchen that serves some yummy snacks."

Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Nov 29, 2023","A friend invited me to a show here a couple of weeks ago. Im used to going to shows in smaller bars with absolutely no seating so the couches and other seats were much appreciated by me and my little group as we quickly claimed one of them as ours for the night. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, and they had really good lighting/stage effects for the bands that were playing that night. I would say really fun venue and bands. That night We saw Vudu Caravan (ig vuducaravanband), La Sombra (ig lasombra.noise), and Dead Engine (ig deadenginetheband)"

Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Sep 29, 2023","After 20 or more events that my wife and I had the pleasure of attending, weve enjoyed every single one! I would love to experience live music here every chance I get!! The atmosphere, the friendly staff, the very reasonable price of every event that we were able to go to and the location making it a short drive from the south bay area, which means that this has become my favorite place for music! Thank you."

Art Boutiki Music Hall,"Aug 29, 2023","It s a former comic-gaming store that s using the stage for the usual stage purposes now.  Small venue using banquet hall chairs (with a few sofas picked up from the side of the road strewn on the sides), tragic from-frozen snacks, and of course overpriced alcohol. I went to see comedy, maybe better floor plan for music (and less need for libations)."

One of those places that you will see a band that one day makes it big and you will say, I saw that band at a cool little spot in San Jose one night.

This is a one of a kind, all ages, music venue with tons of geeky and amazing comic books for sale in the front of the house. An incredible combination, I know. But it just works The quality of musical acts are second to none and the sound system is awesome. The crowd here is great and they sell decent food, wine, beer, soft drinks. You gotta see this place to understand its true awesomeness. Support this local music venue, it is a rare gem."
