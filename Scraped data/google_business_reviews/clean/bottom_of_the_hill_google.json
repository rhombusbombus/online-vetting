We showed up at to a concert at 8 (the time stated on the ticket), and went inside, only to learn that the performers wouldn t go on until at-least 10 (and that the openers wouldnt preform till at least 9?). Since we were not told this and we now had 2 hours to burn, we tried to leave and were told that of we did, we could not come back in. Since we didnt want to wait 2 hours in a hot cramped space (with no seats), we left and lost the money we paid for tickets. Very unhappy with the way the venue handled this whole situation, and how the venue communicates policies about their concerts. Would definitely not come again :("

    "review": "Bottom of the Hill is a great venue for punk shows (and other live music Im sure, but the interior definitely appeals to the 80s/90s punk fan). The main area is open and can accommodate a small circle pit, and the sound system is good. I dig the framed concert posters that fill the walls of the back room; it gives you something to look at when lounging at one of the few tables. Theres also a  back patio that has some benches & chairs for fresh air/smoke breaks (kinda counterintuitive, I know). I should also note that theres plenty of free parking on the street, and the neighborhood is pretty clean; Ive never seen any dirts roaming around, but it is San Francisco,  sooooo... Ive only gone to punk shows at Bottom of the Hill, thus tickets have been relatively cheap ($20-$25, including the ~$5 fees), so no complaints there. I cant remember how much drinks cost or how good they were---which likely means they werent ridiculously over-priced and got the job done---but I typically drink gin & tonics, and you cant really go wrong with those."

The shape and sound of the room is great for those mid-size touring acts, but every time I have been, the place was packed, which always feels good to see the strong support for those lesser well known acts. Gotta give it up for this venue for giving those great bands a solid platform. Tickets are usually very reasonably priced. If anything, they seem unrealistic for San Francisco, but thats why I love this place. Holding it down, and maintaining an enclave for the arts and expression to thrive in the heart of a city sterilized by cost of living."

But thats not all! Making new friends is #classic when you find that one person in the crowd who just sets the #night on #fire So #cozy with black light posters that glow during the show (if you can pay attention... But if youre paying attention to a poster while someone is playing, #best be the #opener! ) and are #gorgeous In one word: #balls In two words: #bigballs In three words!: #bigbouncyballs In six words!?!: #bigbouncyballsoffthewalls I mean it! No lie... Watching @kflay for the 4th time (2nd time here! First time was a little over 5 years ago on my 5th year anniversary being married to the #absolute #love of my #life! #Ruby (Not her actual name, but thats a whole nother story all together! - for another time  ) yesterday on #taxday and I would say @kflay killed the show... But that would be a #lie! @kflay WAS THE #SHOW and oh boy could I tell you about it!! But there just isnt enough time, because this is all about @ thebottomofthehill While @kflay (whom btw I just #HAVE to mention, just to give you a taste of how bad I stink!   I literally brought my #bassguitar for @kflay to sign.  Why does that stink? #GOODQUESTION! The answer: I only told her #literally #hours before the show and I #actually thought I would have my #cookies because I prefer over cake - You are what you eat! and eat it too. Was soo heavy, and some might say for nothing! I say Only a small part to yet another #unbelievable story I have to tell!) did not sign my bass, I #did lock eyes with her as she exited the stage, but instead of what happened right when I got there! (which after years of experience in going the distance for a show, leaving #fashionably #late not only #avoids #traffic, but if timed properly... You make it right for the headliner! #fortherecord - I have showed up soo late to catch only #three songs, but I won the tickets soo... ) I went straight to the back to check out whatever inventory was left, and as I turned around to find my #muchbetterhalf @rubyubie she was no where to be found because from the #patio area #coincidentally located in the back, walks into the room non other than @kflay herself! And I was taken back... #Frozen like a #skunk in the headlights as she took less than ten steps #probably and #tookthestage Reminded me of the time one of my most #influential #idols came walking down the stairs right in front of my face! #Who? Im so glad you asked! #BlakeSchwartzenbach (Not his actual name... If you have #noclue who he is, I could probably say the same about me! Unlike me though, he is SO SMART! His first band I fell in love with is called @Jawbreaker and straight from the horses mouth - #24HourRevengeTherapy is #thealbum that was Their first complete story.  SO! A little more about Jawbreaker... They started out 100% punk, and wouldnt you know, back when they first blossomed, they would play #here! See how it all comes togerther? #butwaittheresmore! Soo.. #24 was their #breakthrough album where pretty much one line from one of their #famous songs you probably know, but you dont know you know, but you should know! (hehehe heads up! Hes so smart!!! You have to decifer what hes really saying in #alot of the lyrics ex. I blew twelve kisses and kissed your thirteenth finger. #thinkaboutit #Itjustmakessensewhenyoudontthinktoohard ) called #boxcar suming up what they #wanted to say!  First line Youre not #punk, and Im telling everyone! Save your breath!  I never was one... You dont know what Im all about. Like killing cops and reading #keroac  This was the #first #notable #breakthrough #album for me that is so #personal I am pretty much explained through #every #song The other album half, in the exact same #wantingtoshowwhattheyweremadeof @TheOffspring s #IxnayontheHombre (Which I literally bought the vinyl just a day before the show! Bought the cd back in 97) Both reminded me of @kflay !!! P.s. - @kflay #MUSTHAVES!"

The place is mostly a dive bar, with little tables / seats and a stage, from what I know, since they mostly focus on shows. the acoustics are alright, definitely fine for seeing someone you enjoy. I read previous reviews stating parking may result in break-ins, but parking about a block away had no issue, it didnt even feel sketchy, though I would still hide or take valuables. It mostly is an industrial from what I can tell (live in the East bay), with little people roaming around at night outside of people in the neighborhood or people working."

Cool area in the back of the club for bands to set up merch tables to sell records and tshirts...etc.... Cover charge is decent for a medium capacity venue. Bartenders are usually prompt...I feel the prices for drinks are on the higher side. The vibe can be a little cold as far as friendliness is concerned. All staff seem a bit standoffish, but it is not a big concern to me in the grand scheme of things,as no one is militant or helecoptering over me. I can relax here and it feels adaquately spacious inside and out. Parking is okay...I usually find a space. The location is good, not too far from the Bay bridge."

You can typically buy tickets in advance or at the door, at least, I had those options. The sound as good but the lighting is pretty dark, even for a club. I would recommend bringing ear plugs, especially if youre up close. There are mens and womens bathrooms but theyre not clearly labeled to the right of the stage. Theres a picture of a little girl on the ladies door, which has 2 stalls and 1 sink. The bathroom was small but clean. Parking in the area is a bit of an issue, so Id recommend arriving early and parking on the street. Just pay really close attention to street signs and parking restrictions because some areas require permits so be prepared. I usually like parking in pay lots because of safety but the neighborhood seemed ok. It is in San Francisco, so if you dont like parking on hills (which I dont), just try to be there early to look for your ideal parking. Enjoy your shows!"

    "review": "I had not been to Bottom of the Hill in years until last night 2/1/18. The Lillingtons were in town and I did not want to miss out on this! Doors at 8:30, show at 9. I arrived at 9:10 and the place was already packed. Friendly staff checking IDs and tickets. I did not order food or beverage while there, but saw others enjoying spirits and eats. It gets pretty warm inside, but theres a back patio you can escape to. Clean, stocked restroom. Attended another (sold out) show on 2/17/18, my car was broken into. While they do post notices on their door and windows stating to leave nothing in your vehicle, my car and several others were hit sometime between 9pm -1 am. This venue does not allow in and out privileges for patrons.  With that being said, perhaps they will consider posting security OUTSIDE the venue to deter things like this from happening.  People will be less excited about coming to a venue when their vehicle is likely to get vandalized or worse.  Luckily, there was nothing in my car to steal, however the damage they did to the vehicle itself is costly. If you have a hatchback, I recommend removing your rear deck lid so thieves can see you have nothing back there.  Hopefully it saves you a broken window, or worse."

You can rent the space out on nights they arent booked for a show for much less than you would pay if you were, say, trying to buy the place out in lieu of a concert. You just have to wait for the next months calendar to come out and then pick a date they would normally be closed. This calls for super fast party planning, but its worth it."

The bar also had a variety of local beers, so its a live house recommended for beer lovers."

The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash. Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their special shots listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldnt have much sound/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so thats great for those who drive. Its also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain."

If you get there too late and you end up in the back and youre short like me, you cant see much.  We were lucky to be about 6 deep from the stage.  Also this venue brings something out in the artist where theyre wanting to be part of the audience and theyre more than willing to come down and sing on the floor. The used the back room to sell merchandise the night we were here.  The wait is long since we had to make a line against the wall and wait for the meet and greet and then by merch all in the small back room.  But it was cool because everyone hung out and chatted with fans.  The guy that worked there was very good about keeping things organized, keeping people from cutting the line and really just a cool dude. The down side of this venue, waiting outside can get cold, the area is really dirty with trash and the risk of having your car broken into."

    "review": "Such an intimate venue! If youre lucky enough to have one of your favorite bands playing here, dont miss it. The first time I went was to see fun. and I was shocked to find out the venue only held ~100 people - fun. had just played a huge show the night before.  Obviously a smaller place, but whoever was running it did a good job of not overcrowding it.  Easy to get drinks at and some outdoor space as well...agree with some other reviews that it is a little harder to get there due to location."
