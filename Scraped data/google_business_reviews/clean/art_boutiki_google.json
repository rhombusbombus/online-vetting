Hard folding chairs with a few leather couches around the perimeter. While I wish the chairs were more comfortable, the fact is there are few places that highlight the music and the musicians.  I will keep coming back for this kind of atmosphere and music talent level."

They sell a broad variety of interesting items,  ranging from comic books to t-shirts, posters and random, humorous curiosities.  Behind the shop is the actual music hall.  This is a cozy little venue that holds maybe 150-200 people. Great sight lines to the stage, which sits in front of a wall covered by hundreds of really cool album covers. They have an excellent variety of beers available from local breweries like Almanac and Drakes. There is also a tiny kitchen that serves some yummy snacks."

Im used to going to shows in smaller bars with absolutely no seating so the couches and other seats were much appreciated by me and my little group as we quickly claimed one of them as ours for the night. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, and they had really good lighting/stage effects for the bands that were playing that night. I would say really fun venue and bands. That night We saw Vudu Caravan (ig vuducaravanband), La Sombra (ig lasombra.noise), and Dead Engine (ig deadenginetheband)"

The sound is great, they treat the musicians well, the food is fantastic and incredible people run the place. In addition, they have a special dessert option that isnt on the menu. Ask Dan for the dessert called The Arsonist. You wont be disappointed."
