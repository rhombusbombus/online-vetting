As you know, we just launched the new rehearsal facilities recently, and we are constantly working to improve them, and to improve the customer experience each and every day. Your feedback is incredibly valuable as part of this process. So that you are aware for your next visit, we do have larger room options available, which are our Premium studios, which also have larger and higher quality guitar and bass amps. The premium studios are a much better option for a four person band and larger.

        "ReviewContent": "This is an okay experience as long as you have low standards and dont mind athletes foot. The shared showers are not clean, and gave my roommate the gnarliest case of athletes foot Ive ever witnessed first hand. She had to go to the ER. The hotel, overall, is pretty unclean. The private rooms are better than the shared rooms, but theyre still pretty dated and not really comfortable. They attempted to play up the aesthetic, without really understanding how to decorate or choose linens or anything. Its like a teenager with a very small budget was behind the entire construction and decoration of this place. Staff arent great, they have basic customer service skills but spend a lot of time hanging out with their friend/boyfriends when they should be focusing on answering phones or caring for customers or cleaning perhaps.",

We are very sorry to hear that you did not have a great experience during your stays with us. Cleanliness and Customer service/Staff are typically the two highest categories in our review scores, and we are sorry to learn that you did not agree. Our shared showers are kept very clean and are serviced multiple times per day, so we were a bit shocked to read your comment regarding your fellow guest in the shared room. If anything of that nature were reported to us we would certainly address an issue like that to the fullest extent, as we care deeply about our guests and the safety of our guests. Once again, we are so sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience with us, we are in continual efforts to improve our services and offerings and will certainly address your feedback with our staff.
