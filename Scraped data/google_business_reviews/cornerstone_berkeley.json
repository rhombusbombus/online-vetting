Its roomy and spacious, with seating to accommodate large parties. The kitchen specializes in tasty comfort food. Think burgers, sandwiches, fish and chips, and things that stick to your ribs. They do have a couple vegetarian options, if thats a concern. You order your food at the bar, and staff brings it to your table. Prices for the food are very reasonable. Most of the money youll spend here will apply to the drinks. If you see a show here, its a standing-only venue, though staff can make special accommodation for seats if you are injured or have a disability if you notify them ahead of time. They have a bar in the back, if you want a drink during the show. The sound system is great.",

        "ReviewContent": "Ok so we went here to see Foreverland (a Michael Jackson cover band) and this was my first time here. I have to say they kinda hide the concert venue in the back and up the stairs beyond the bathrooms. First impressions, new, open space tall ceilings big ol tap bar and sweet outdoor back area. Kudos in the design as you cannot hear the noise from the game in the concert area and thus cannot hear the concert in the bar area, they did a great job of sound proofing. Also the outside area in the back is walled up so its open at the top but with a few umbrella style shades and gas fire for warmth, I like it. The staff were friendly and helpful, the drinks were tasty especially the Apple chai hard kombucha (amazing). We really were excited to try their food n dessert offerings but were a few minutes late to order. Parking can be an issue as its limited so go early and take note that their kitchen closes around 8-830. I will definitely be going back, this time to try the food n another drink. Wheelchair accessibility: There was no access ability for the music venue up the stairs in the rear that I could see.",

I was surprised at how roomy everything felt after things got going. It looks small but its a nice place to see a show. The beers were $6 and the specialty drinks were a little more. I dont know if the bar portion has the same price range. But it was nice to be able to drink affordably when you consider typical concert drink prices. The sound was hella good.

The sound in the venue was as amazing as Hypocrisy and the other bands that played Friday night.  Itll be a night Ill never forget, all thanks to the generous hospitality of the staff and others who attended as well, and getting one awesome seat to enjoy the music that these live bands were playing.  Great place to relax and just enjoy oneself.",

The rebuild inside is completely all Hardwood and looks beautiful, the back area has several Oak tables, where one might sneak a smoke and I think, but the thing that makes this place shine really is the excellent stage room, the really nice sound system beautiful Acoustics, and a nice layout. Havent eaten here yet, but I asked the bartender, like I often do, you just make me a fancy-schmancy Tequila drink and he created something for me called a Peligrosa Formosa drink made with peligrosa tequila. The staff here is great, and on top of everything going on, bartenders know how to mix drinks and there is an absolutely huge selection of tap beers numbering around 42. I am reviewing this day mostly as a night club or bar, Ill come back at a later date and give a review of the food. So far so good!",

        "ReviewContent": "A welcome addition to Berkeley (3.5 Green Stars) I haven t written a review for two months   the guilt! Looking through my photos, I m going to review places where I ve been, in reverse order. First up is Cornerstone, and I have to say that I m proud of this photo. A basket of fries and pint of Death & Taxes, sitting on my table in the evening light, took on the gravity and artistry of a masterwork by Vermeer or Degas. Anyhoo, after a solitary start with my beer and fries, it ended up being a big group   a post-lockdown work reunion   and I think everyone was pretty happy with their night. I like Cornerstone because it s one of those bars where you re more likely to mix with more people (within your own group or randos) rather than somewhere like Jupiter where people tend to not leave their seats. Not that I don t love Jupiter   the two places are similar in some ways but Cornerstone adds a level of chaos (but in a good way!). Good selection of beer and food, spacious and pretty   what more do you want? I m also giving the Cornerstone 3.5 out of 5  Green Stars  for social and environmental impact, based on this: Large emphasis on local draft beer, which is so much better than packaged beer from afar. On this visit, the staff ran out of clean glasses and switched to plastic cups. Generally that doesn t happen but hopefully it won t become a trend. The food menu caters well for vegetarians and fairly well for vegans. No info is provided on social and environmental impact (e.g., food sourcing, staff benefits, etc.) According to Glassdoor, a server/bartender earns around $16/hr plus around $10/hr in tips.

My friend recommended Cornerstone. I called ahead to get an idea of the vibe and spoke to a gentleman named Mendoza. He told us he would take care of us and he did. We showed up right before the time we were told it would get crowded. We had a table outside near the fire pits, in ear shot of the DJ. It was awesome. The food was great, drinks were yummy and strong ( for me but Im a cheap date My husband said they were perfect). Delicious German beer that my husband loved. Staff came around often to check on guests. As the night went on the crowds got bigger. All wearing masks. Im glad we stayed outside, inside was a bit too crowded for me as the night went on. But it made me happy to see people dancing inside. I was worried this was another club like atmosphere full of 20-30somethings and we would look out of place, but not at all. People of all ages were present ( we are in our 40s). The DJ played music from 90s Era to present.. Bar tenders were attentive. It was all around great business. Cant wait to go back. We were told live music will begin again soon. Thanks to Mendoza and the entire staff for giving my husband and I the first real date night we have had since the Pandemic started.",

At that point I asked Steven if he could take something off of the bill because I wasnt satisfied with the fries, and he got an attitude with me, then laughed at me. I told him that I have a disability and that its not right to laugh at people with disabilities, and he said it wasnt his problem.",

When I fell against the the table, a security guard was right there to escort me out, saying he had multiple complaints, which was a lie! No one I had been in contact with had complained about me; not one. When my ankle turned, as oft times it does, and I fell against their wobbly table, which had been a problem all night, as none their tables are, security was right there, a minute later, to accuse me of being drunk and insisted on escorting me out, making me feel like the bad guy. If people were educated about invisible disabilities, this would never have happened. If the security guard had smelled anyone elses breath, he would have smelled the same. Instead, he treated me like a drunk, deciding my disabilities were a lie. I DID NOT LIE! He never offered me ice for my ankle, until I asked. I should have asked for the manager. The notice with the ticket said to let the venue know if you had a condition that needed seating; however, there was NO ONE to speak with. My husband and I were lucky to find a table to sit at, for when I couldnt stand. Because of CORNESTONEs lack of understanding and lack of care for its customers conditions, I missed the end of a concert I had been looking forward to for more than a decade.",

The most disappointing was the nachos. Its not even a basket full, its a few chips on top of a plate. Probably only like 15 tortilla chips on there.

Very generous portion sizes, and all very delicious. The grilled bread is a great side, pairs well with everything and has enough flavor and texture to stand on its own. The condiments that come with the sausages and board were varied and fantastic, added a lot of fun to the meal. They offer 3 tasters per person for drinks of which my party agreed that SLO Brew Cali-Squeeze (Blood Orange Hefeweizen), Moonlight Black to Reality (Czech Dark Lager... very dark!), and Mission Trail Aqua Dulce (cider... not too sweet) were the favorites. Our server was very very kind and accommodating even though he was just about to clock out. He made really great, descriptive suggestions and was very knowledgeable on what they had available. Made sure we had all the tasters, drinks, and food we needed before seeing us off for the night. Could not ask for more considerate and cheerful service. One note is that this place can be very popular with students so we had our IDs checked and partway through the night we were informed that a party of college students was coming in so we had to put on wristbands to order more drinks past a certain time. It was no hassle and the employees were efficient in notifying us and getting wristbands for us. There are restrooms available with multiple stalls which was great especially after the group event had started.

The sound system is great, the music hall is clean, the beer selection is fantastic, and the bands they bring through are solid. Cornerstones been a huge shot in the arm for Bay Area emo and pop punk, which previously was limited to essentially Bottom of the Hill and Slims. Ill keep seeing shows here as long as they keep booking them, and I hope word gets out that Cornerstone is worth the trip from SF. Berkeley is a bit isolated from the rest of that concert scene and late-night BART to the area is a pain but its easily one of the best venues in the region.",

However, Justin is great and quite exceptional.  Last night was my first time going to see music in the back on a busy Saturday. If seeing show, I highly suggest going when the music venue doors open and going upstairs to the balcony to get a bar stools. Also, there are great views of the stage up there.  Otherwise, its just an open floor plan for standing on the ground floor. There a few chairs against the wall on the ground floor too. If you are seeing the show,  get your drinks at the bar inside the music venue. There are less people and you need a plastic cup once inside the music venue anyway. We didnt know that and waited forever at the main bar. Before we could go into the music venue we had to wait to transfer our drinks to a plastic cup, right there at the door. It was awkward. But all in all, a fabulous venue for music, food, drinks and fun.",

One things for sure, the emergency exits are so visible that it can be distracting when viewing from the second floor. But then again, that might just be me. House speaker sounds aint that great but again, it might just be the fault of the sound engineer. It was however obvious that even the bands were having a hard time hearing themselves despite the looooong soundcheck by their tech crew. Lights were cool and overall aesthetic is pretty nice. Connected to the music venue is the brewhouse, so having craft beer in a music venue is definitely a plus. They have food as well, if youre hungry. Their food is topnotch. I can see myself coming here just for the food itself.",

We all get food and drinks. I asked to try a beer and I ended up not liking it at all. (Mind you I took a sip). When I told her I didnt like it she took it back no problem AND not telling me about their policy. I asked her can i get another beer and again  no problem. Then the bartender JOHN came up to me and gave me my new beer and rudely and awkwardly asked me why dont I like the beer, and whats wrong with it,  didnt you order this last time (never been here before) , just questioning why I didnt like it as if he was offended. He then told me he had to charge me for the first beer (even tho I sipped it once). Me and my friends are bartenders and have never seen this before. He said its their policy. Which is fine but dont interegate your   paying customers and go about it in a rude way. This policy is ridiculous, plus next time have the waitress have the balls to tell her own table the policy and everything could have been avoided. You guys should rethink how you go about telling people about your policy. Never will be back to this place! If I would give 0 stars I would.",

For now I will say this is a spacious, light and airy conversion of the previous dark pool hall into beer and food venue with attached music space. Theres even an outdoor patio with fire pits. Went here with a group of a about a dozen folks and we were able to reserve a couple of long communal tables. On a Tuesday night it was plenty quiet enough for conversation among us which is a pleasant change from bars that insist on making you shout. They had a good selection of craft beers and a full bar for the non-beer drinkers. Food that I tasted was good and a nice variety of smaller plates often being a twist on more traditional pub fare. For instance I had pork belly nachos - very tasty and good to share. There are some larger seating areas a big group could congregate although not as convenient if you wanted to eat anything that want finger food. The outdoor area does not have heat lamps so in the winter (which is most of summer here too) you will need to dress warm or huddle close to the fire.",

Slightly expensive with poor service; half the bartenders at any given time are on their break. Bouncers are incredibly rude and overly aggressive. If there werent other good bars in the area this could get 2 stars, but there are many places that are far better nearby so this isnt worth your time.",

I visited to try the food twice: once when they first opened the kitchen (which is when you would expect them to put their best foot forward), then again recently, because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. The music venue is cool. The recreational activities are fun. The liquor selection is nothing to write home about. The owner is only passionate about filling his pockets and getting chummy with college girls in the VIP section during shows. But hey, what do you expect from that super classy old guy who runs Pappys? There are too many good places in Berkeley to waste ones time helping this slob line his pockets.",

        "ReviewContent": "This place was very nice and open, with a wooden top bar vs a metal top bar with spaced barstools. The host was friendly and greeted us promptly and offered us menus. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender greeted us quickly and gave us food menus. She made our drinks while we waited for our food. She was incredibly nice and patient with my friends dairy allergy. The music was loud enough to hear but subtle enough to talk which was great. Our bill was pretty low even though she waved a drink off for using rum instead of tequila, which we didnt mind. The only reason I put 4 instead of 5 is because the food portion was a bit small. Normally we get anything and share fries and be stuffed but we ended up eating somewhere else after too. This place has big tables for larger groups and a wide selection of beer on tap and alcohol. I definitely recommend this place.",

        "ReviewContent": "The bar itself was very pleasant and friendly. However the staff for the music venue need to seriously rework their policies. I went to the Offspring show last night and was ejected for crowdsurfing onto the stage, along with several others who did the same thing. When I tried talking to a few of the staff at the door, they told me I was done and needed to leave. Firstly, its a punk show; crowdsurfing is going to happen whether you like it or not. If you dont want people reaching the stage, then put a barricade up. Second, if people do get onstage and you dont want them there, SAY SOMETHING. Give warnings and escort people back to the floor. Resorting immediately to ejection without willing to discuss what happened is ridiculous and unprofessional. There was also an incident where I was thrown out (attention to the word thrown) after falling on somebody and not being able to get back up, but that was more confusing than anything and less of a problem since I was able to blend with a group re-entering with no trouble. But still, that could be a lawsuit waiting to happen if someone seriously injures themselves being man-handled like that. Those tickets were not cheap, and having my night almost ended over something as trivial as crowdsurfing is absurd. I would have been willing to tone my actions down if I knew it was prohibited, but there was nothing that indicated it was, and no one was willing to talk to me about it after it happened. If this is how the staff at the venue are always going to be then I will take my business elsewhere.",

My friend of course had an open tab which required him to leave his ID behind the bar which just added to the confusion.",
