        "ReviewContent": "My now wife (Char) and hosted a camping weekend after our wedding ceremony at Venture Retreat Center. The space was perfect for what we were looking for. Its rustic and a bit rough around the edges, but it has all the creature comforts you would need in a glamping getaway (power, heated showers, a HOT TUB). Janelle was very easy to work with. Venture got hit pretty hard by a mud slide earlier in the year and Janelle was working hard to make sure that we had a good experience and had everything we needed. We catered one of our meals through Loma Mar (and loved it). Venture is a beautiful space, surrounded by a ton of beauty. We hosted a field trip to the beach with a geology talk/tide pool viewing, a crochet circle, karaoke. It was just a lovely space that helped us facilitate community. Janelle had set up a number of bell tents for our guests, which were super clean, and spacious. The yurt provided the perfect heated, powered activity room for our guests when it got cold. The large tent with bed + fridge, coffee, made for the perfect honeymoon suite. We are looking forward to their renovations and returning in the years to come.",

        "ReviewContent": "Weve used Venture Retreat as our wedding venue, and then again as a weekend getaway with a small group of friends - fantastic experience both times. Venture is magical, whimsical space and the energy can be felt as soon as you arrive. If youre looking for a glamorous, luxurious retreat space, this may not be for you - but if you love feeling at home, a casual environment, and beautiful natural scenery in an absolutely serene woodsy sanctuary, this is your spot!

Everyone adored the venue. The management is so down to earth and not wedding industry-ish at all. Plenty of room for all the little events we wanted to have. My only regret is that I didnt book the place for the Thursday night before too bc once we got there we didnt want to leave.",

Not only is it full of natural beauty (the gardens, the old growth trees, the butterflies and bees flying around), but the staff and owner are very helpful, prepared, and responsive. Having our wedding at the Venture Center was definitely the easiest wedding planning decision we made. Thank you, Janelle!",

        "ReviewContent": "We held a 3-day work retreat at Venture, a great venue for our group. Since our last stay here in 2018 the center has had a significant upgrade, with a clean fresh makeover and lots of lovely touches. The surroundings are peaceful and tranquil, and we really appreciated all the amenities - an in-ground pool and large hot tub, fire pit, deck, and more. Theres a new admin assistant, Sarah, who is very helpful and responsive (in the past it was sometimes hard to reach anyone at the center.) And Janelle stayed in constant touch during our stay, answering all questions promptly and sending maintenance help when needed, even late at night. We were so glad to be meeting in person again, and Venture was the perfect place to do it. Highly recommended for a family or work gathering.",

The grounds are beautiful, the kitchen well-stocked (with three working refrigerators), the cabins and rooms were clean and had plenty of blankets/pillows, and the staff were attentive. I will certainly be holding events there in the future. Highly recommend!",

        "ReviewContent": "UNPROFESSIONAL AND OVERBOOKING ISSUES! POSSIBLE SCAM. We booked this place back in February of 2021 (paid in full) for a bachelorette trip in August. Patiently waiting in excitement for this trip. Drove 4 hours just to find out they overbooked us. They are quick to take someone else money $2k+ and to their excuse  they accidentally delete our booking  I find this very unprofessional and disappointing especially throughout the whole process WE KEPT IN CONTACT! I don t understand!!! They requested for us to book throughout their site instead of Airbnb because they prefer not booking through 3rd party. ALSO they request for us to pay through Zelle ... ??????? SCAM!! Although our trip didn t go according to how we initially wanted we made it work and I m glad things turned out the way it did. Please please think THRICE before booking this place.",
