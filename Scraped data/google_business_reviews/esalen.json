I have worked as a traditional medicine woman and much of what is taught here just screams fake and new age garbage to me. Overall, lack of accessibility, diversity, and superficiality gives this a one star for me. Plus, one of their workshops was based on eugenics and discriminated against autistic people. Like really?

        "ReviewContent": "I have heard of Esalen for many years and was really looking forward to going when I signed up for a craniosacral workshop through Upledger. Quite frankly I had one of the worst experiences of my life. First of all my dingy little room was not worth the $2000 I paid. At all. Ive stayed at better inns and beds/breakfasts for less. Second, I witnessed children pushing laundry carts which to me seems like child labor? Not ok. Also as soon as I was arrived I was literally screamed at by a staff member for crossing a bridge on car that HAD NO SIGNS. When I explained that it was my first time, I was lost, he continued to yell and scream, handling the situation completely inappropriately. Also the class I took is founded on theories of Eugenics? Especially as it pertains to those with Autism. I found this to be unprofessional at best and disturbing at worst. There was language in this course in regards to fixing or curing those with Autism. At the very least this is a dated ignorant viewpoint but it also very disturbing and dangerous. Individuals with autism are people, not science experiments, and are whole and complete as they are. Any language around fixing or curing autism is a red flag at best. I am hugely disappointed the institution would allow, support and endorse a course like this?? I will be pursuing options to get my money back this was frankly one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Overhyped.",

        "ReviewContent": "Basically my wife had scheduled a surprise herbal massage and wellness treatment for our anniversary. For years I have tried to schedule a visit but could never find an open availability or COVID shutdown cancelled any plans. Upon arrival we were denied entrance because apparently we could pay for services but not have a day pass. Apparently the website was not clear or allowed a purchase for a couples event. The massage was only 1.5 hours but the $400 couples session required another $400 for an additional Day pass for me if as they put it was a favor since we traveled all the way. $800 for only 1.5 hour couples massage just didn t seem appropriate or helpful. The woman at the security entrance was nice but could not explain why we were sold anything scheduled after 4pm given we were not staying on the premises. The whole experience was not professional or well managed. For years I wanted to experience the wellness and historical significance of Esalen. We were told that because of our trouble and this special circumstance they would make a special concession and refund my wife s anniversary gift as I was not interested in paying the additional $400 for an extra day pass for only 1.5 hours. No concern or option to reschedule for another day. As we sat in our car for over 15  to 20 minutes while the security person and management would call and try to understand their website and scheduling problem we watched as 3 or 4 old dented dilapidated cars exited the property. We watched as people walked to our entrance guard and interrupted repeatedly for towels and told they could have 2 towels only if they returned their towels or left them somewhere in  the system ? At that point I just wanted to leave. I am sad for my Wife who was very disappointed and left with her special anniversary surprise an absolute debacle. I was happy save the day with an excellent 4+ hour anniversary dinner at Post Ranch Inn. It is a shame Esalen could not honor our scheduled 1.5 couples massage and fix the issue with their reservation system. FYI bring your own towels if you do get the opportunity to experience this place. At this point I don t recommend the trouble or experience of going. My expectations have been severely diminished. Good Luck.",

        "ReviewContent": "I used to frequent Esalen during the late 60s and 70s,  yes, the Murphy days. Moved out of CA only to return to Big Sur decades later on a cross country road trip. My plans included a pre booked two day retreat at the Institute, I wanted to come back so bad. Unfortunately, this time I was completely disappointed. Right off the bat and based on the prices charged, there is nothing about being a non-profit organization. Okay, I can live with that, but lets make it clear and dont mislead. Reception wasnt precisely warm or inviting, but rather rude and robot-ized. Bad start. I also noticed quite young staff with little or no true hands-on credentials, portraying an ambience of fake friendliness and rehearsed speech, only comparable to a car dealership. And that really bothered me. There is also a very strong sense of disregard (I will omit using the term discrimination) towards golden age folks, especially those of us who originallly contributed to the accolades this place currently enjoys. To add more insult to injury, vax is required, quite a baffling contrast to the natural healing concept the Institution strongly preaches, not to mention the mushroom ceremony. During my 2 day stay, I was never tranquil, much less in peace with myself or with the place. Instead, I was totally in disbelief and frustrated. Sure, the facilities and scenery remain spectacular, but unfortunately Esalens main core and unique magic are long gone. In summary, todays Esalen rides more on name and past glory than true fulfillment. It seems their priorities now focus on profits than actual healing. Quite sad to see a wonderful place taking a wrong turn.",

Esalen helped me achieve this in many ways. The grounds are truly jaw dropping and gorgeous. The baths were magical with the natural heated spring water. The massage offering was wonderful and much needed. The other guests were all open and friendly and the views from my premium room were incredible. I arrived expecting a retreat center so I wasnt surprised to see the sparsely appointed room and tiny shower. I also expected a cafeteria style dining hall rather than a sit down restaurant. All good! Im sure some expect a more hotel like experience- this is not that. I was on a solo/ self-guided retreat alongside ten other folks. All of us there for various reasons. I appreciated the light programmatic options and that there was zero pressure to attend or not attend. During the week there was a massage training workshop and a womens retreat and those folks would pop in and out of the shared programming as their schedules allowed. I certainly left with a couple of new friendships and a much clearer head on my shoulders. JJ, one of the teachers, was warm, good humored and wise. I enjoyed my time with him and certainly left with new insights about life from him. On a more practical note: I also appreciated the free Tesla and EV chargers available for guests. Super helpful and pretty easy to access despite a full campus of Tesla driving guests. Also- Im glad I brought layers of clothing as they recommended. The weather was perfect - low 70s during the day but cool and damp at night being right on the water. This is why there are hoodies! A few negatives: They need to work on their cleaning- my room was littered with the last guests hair- an easy thing to remedy if the crew is trained and given the right tools. Im vegetarian and only one lunch or dinner the whole week didnt feature Tofu as the main option.  I am glad I brought snacks. Despite their website saying no kids under 16, three of the five days I was on campus there were kids running around. Not quietly in the corner- Im talking racing through the dining commons and bath house being loud and energetic. A huge reason I chose Esalen was to find tranquility so it was really disappointing to see that there are children running around on a frequent basis- even at the baths! When another solo-traveller brought this up to the Esalen team during the orientation, we were assured that it was an off day due to the Memorial Day Holiday and kids are never around.  Apparently he was too optimistic. I hope that in the future Esalen will work on diversity and inclusion. Theres a whole world of people who would benefit from this experience besides white women in leggings. It will require direct outreach to communities that may not resemble the staff or leaders at this organization. I hope they will be brave and figure out this key component to make Esalen stronger and the world a better place.",

My massage done by Corrine was heavenly. Im adding an addendum as of 11/21/2021... Something new and also very unwelcome and very much lacking the spirit of Esalen as it was. Turns out that Ive been spammed mercilessly by the seminar leader of the seminar I took during my last visit. There were three or four demands that I fill out long surveys and then endless advertisements to attend his next seminar in December. This is very very unwelcome... frankly, Michael Murphy must be rolling in his grave with this kind of stuff going on.",

Esalen is also rightly famous for its stunning natural hot spring baths, poised on the edge of a cliff above the Pacific surf, and its superb massage offerings--some of the best in the world.

Three waters converge there: the ocean, a mountain river and underground hot springs. We would say a spa, but this is in no way a spa; they call themselves Esalen Institute. It was founded by American psychologists Murphy and Price, followers of Aldous Huxley and his Human Development Movement. I have known Michael Murphy for a long time; he is a close friend of mine. People gather at Esalen to participate in seminars, psychological trainings, discussions about philosophy, mediative practices, and bioenergy. All outdoors, under the sun, in hot springs. Everyone is naked - both men and women. In short, an absolutely magical atmosphere. And then one day I went out there for a run in the morning and didn t notice how I ran 14 kilometers! Endorphins, so to speak. I didnt run, I flew. But anyway, first of all, I love game sports, and I like to play tennis seriously.",

I was worried that I would be able to see the ocean from the tubs, but they do a great job lighting up the ocean so that you can watch the waves crash on the rocks down below. Clothing is optional. Most people seemed to naked. There is something magical about being so calm in the hot springs water and listening to the chaos of the ocean below. Totally worth the middle of the night drive.",

        "ReviewContent": "For such a revered, healing-centered entity, there is a glaring disconnect between Esalens stated mission and history, and the attitude of the staff we encountered there. Another reviewer commented on their experience of the staff here as: extremely rude; seemed not to care one bit about what had happened. Accurately describes the experience I had as a night bather at Esalen just a couple of weeks ago. Bear in mind that the night bathing takes place from 1 - 3 am. We (including my partner and her cousin) showed up early, as we were camping not far from Esalen. When it was time to walk down, we asked the gentleman leading us down the hill where we could get towels. He said they prefer not to give out towels, but that we could ask at the entrance kiosk. Hmm. Once we got down to the kiosk, we asked the woman there, named Tony I believe, if we could have towels. She refused, responding with a pedantic and dismissive, we dont give towels to night bathers, in a tone that indicated we were somehow both undeserving and foolish for even asking. As if she was doing us a favor. As if it were already charity to let us use the facility, and not $35 per person, and that giving us a towel was just going above and beyond. Yes, you read that right: An establishment that charges $35 a person for two hours for the express purpose of *being in water* refused paying customers towels. I suppose we could have just left at that point, but we had paid our money, waited around to walk down, and gotten our hopes up...so, we decided to brave it without towels. What else were we supposed to do? After making a reservation online, by the way, this is *verbatim* the text regarding towels on Esalens website: Please support Esalens sustainable practices and if possible bring your own towel and consider towel usage on the planet, thank you. Note the words, IF POSSIBLE. I have attached a photo and circled this statement on their towel policy from their website. One would infer from this that Esalen has towels for those who forgot to bring one, or in our case, for those who came from camping and dont necessarily have all of the amenities of someone staying at a hotel or coming from a home. The next phase of our experience is truly mind-blowing. To our absolute shock and dismay, we discovered a couple had brought AN INFANT along with them. Tony was all smiles and sunshine with them, though, as we waited to walk down to the baths. It gets worse. There are two areas of tubs: one marked, Silent Room (an actual room) and another Quiet Room (which is outdoors). After changing, we made our way into the Silent Room. Guess whos in there? The couple and their crying infant. In the Silent Room. At 1 am. WITH A CRYING INFANT. This meant everyone else (probably around 20 - 25 people) were forced to crowd into the Quiet Room while the couple and their infant held the so-called Silent Room hostage. When we were done (and we made sure to get out by 3 am since they were adamant that we get off the property, in their words, promptly by then) we put on our clothes, and walked back up the hill dripping wet. Ever put dry clothes on after a shower without toweling off? Lovely. Im still scratching my head wondering what we did to deserve such awful treatment. God forbid we ask for a towel for an experience that revolves around water and that we paid $35 each for. To add insult to injury, we were celebrating a birthday, and though we had never been to Esalen, were excited and talked the place up to our visiting guest. Perhaps it goes without saying that we will never return.",

I was told the Director would call me to figure something out, but was never called back. The woman taking the reservations is extremely rude, seemed not to care one bit about what had happened. I looked in to staying off-site, but you still have to pay almost $600 in facility fees even if you stay off-site, so I had to cancel my trip to Esalen and the training course I was registered in (I was coming from Canada).Will never register for a course here again or visit the site.

My heart was opened, my mind was challenged and my life was blown wide open. I have never been the same since and it is wonderful.  It is a laid back, no cell phone slice of heaven. The food is the best, fresh and healthy right out of the garden. The most interesting people hang out here. The bodyworkers on staff are some of the most talented and diverse I have ever experienced. I will be there next weekend for my 10th and not last visit.",
