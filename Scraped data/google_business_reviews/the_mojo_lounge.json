Unfortunately, the staffs behavior ruined our night. Shockingly, the staff treated us badly because of our race. They made rude comments about our skin color and called us brown people. They stopped us from playing our game intentionally,  When we asked why they were acting this way, they didn t even giving us an proper answer. They even took our drinks away from our hands forcefully. They are asking us to leave the place using very offensive words which is very unfair. We want to tell other immigrants and people of color to be careful about this bar and think twice before going to this place . Lets spread the word and fight against racial discrimination. We requesting  bar owner to check the CCTV footage and take action against the staff who treated us this way. Id give Mojo Lounge a rating of -5 stars if I could. Giving it 1 star only because theres no option for lower. I have noticed many other negative reviews about Mojo Lounge, indicating its not just our incident seems like other people also faced the same that i can see based on their reviews.",

The place was full of musicians and music lovers. As a musician myself, not of any great talent, but nonetheless able to put together a guitar strum and sing a little song, I was interested in trying the place out. What I discovered there was a Mecca of amateur guitar songwriting talent. I was warmly welcomed and encouraged to try my hand there. There were even guitars available for me to use. In the end, I declined because I didnt really have anything ready. Now I regret that decision. Nonetheless, the beer was great, the people were lovely, and the experience was overwhelmingly enjoyable. Next time I go there, on a Sunday night, rest assured Ill be playing! If you choose to go to the Mojo Lounge, choose to do so on a Sunday night. Parking: Some of the back spots are tight to maneuver.",

Dive bar with super-friendly bartender; he was attentive to everyone and very aware of who approached his side and in what order. Professional with no attitude. Drinks are reasonable price! Awesome. Door guard, Wes was super friendly and respectful to everyone! Checked IDs, and told us to have a great nite! He was talkative, approachable and down to earth. Shared more info about future Bolly nights. Your door person can make or break your night. I invited my Bollywood students, around 15 to meet me. In addition, I ran into my kickboxing students as well! Willing to try it out again one more time for the 28th only because  Wes promised a fun, positive attitude & friendly atmosphere. We will return!",

And has regular line bands playing in the nights with a small dame floor if you feel like having fun dancing for the beats of the live music. Good place to hang out with friends, have fun and meet new people. And the prices of the drinks are not expensive either.",

Edit: I decided to give the place another go with some friends and the experience was better than before. The food was enjoyable and the atmosphere was fun. No issues with loud partygoers, though that may change if youre visiting the place well into the night.",

The problems I have is that some of the IPAs they have they dont serve you a full pint. Its like 8oz or something, but they still charge you full price. Also, if you come on the weekends they have live bands and the music is WAY too loud. You absolutely can not hold a conversation. If they fixed that Id definitely start coming on the weekends.",
