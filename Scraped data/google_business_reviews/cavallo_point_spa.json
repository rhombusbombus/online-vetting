        "ReviewContent": "I had complementary access to the mens spa since I was staying at the Cavallo Point Lodge for a couple of nights ($$$). When I checked in at the spa desk, everything seemed fine and I was shown the mens locker room entrance. But when I finally settled and got myself ready (after being frustrated with their non-functional lockers), I noticed that there was a sign on the door of the sauna that it was actually closed for repairs. No mention of this at all when I was at the front desk by staff nor on the front door of the locker room before I took the 10-15 minutes or so getting myself prepped. I get that things break every so often, but I found it bizarre that the staff would omit telling me that the thing I was specifically there for and wanted to use was non-functional before I even got past the meet and greet. After getting dressed and being very annoyed, I walked out and told the front desk about the closure. The gentleman at the desk then told me that its been broken for months and they have no idea when it would be fixed. Great. Thanks for the heads up. So if youre male, dont bother with the spa / sauna here. Despite hearing really good things about this place previously, I had a really disappointing visit and can not recommend this place with its current staff and amenities.",

        "ReviewContent": "I loved my massage. She was a great therapist. I was given a voucher for my Birthday and when I checked in I asked how much the massage was. Deep tissue was $240, I had a $250 voucher, so I said  that s great I have $10 left to spend in the shop! I was immediately reminded that gratuity was not included. After my message I went to settle up and I was told that they add 20% gratuity and included by $10 on my card so the bill was $48 on top of $240 massage! I was told they could change the tip amount manually if I wished. It did not sit right with me. Everywhere else allows you to enter your tip on the card machine. I felt ashamed to ask to leave less but had to as I am out of work at the moment and had a voucher. She had to cancel the transaction and do it again which made me feel like an inconvenience. Customers should NOT be made to feel guilty over gratuities and it was mentioned to me at check in. A 15-18.% gratuity should have been an option like everywhere else and made easy without feeling you have to leave  a 20% gratuity, all in all almost $300 for a 1  hour massage is just way  too expensive.",

        "ReviewContent": "We got 90 minutes massages. Our massage therapists were great and the massage was very relaxing. With taxes and a tip the staff had fixed, the massage cost an absurd $400 per person. This felt criminal considering how subpar the facilities were. The locker rooms were crowded and did not have enough showers. Considering how much nice massage spots in the area cost, this was overpriced by over $200 per massage. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Cavallo Point Spa.",

        "ReviewContent": "My experience at this spa was difficult to articulate. The massage I received was a blend of different techniques, including Thai massage, Swedish, and Lomi Lomi. However, as a licensed massage practitioner, I found the combination of modalities in the 55-minute session to be overwhelming. Perhaps the 90-minute version would offer a better experience. While the practitioner was skilled, the flow of the massage felt disjointed. Additionally, the facilities were not well-maintained, with a band-aid in the outdoor hot tub, dust bunnies, and cobwebs in the lobby, and mediocre staff. Overall, the experience did not justify the high price, and I wouldnt consider returning unless the cost was significantly reduced.",

        "ReviewContent": "The shop at the entrance and the waiting room are nice (although not super cozy). The complimentary hot herbal tea is tasty too. But the more important things are really not great. The locker/bathroom/jacuzzi area feels more like a public swimming pool/gym than a high end spa. The showers in particular were terrible. Massage was subpar. Too much talking, sound of the air purifier was louder than the music,  firm  pressure is too mild and no attention given to uncovered tension areas. It was maybe just bad luck, but the facilities are not nice enough to encourage to come back and give it another try.",

I was still finding clumps of hair falling out when I took a shower afterwards. The whole experience was super painful and my scalp now feels like it s on fire (not in a good way).  What s worse is that my masseuse never even asked me how I felt during the treatment. After 20mins of pain I had to just tell her to stop the massage. The way this masseuse handled my body was like she was roughhousing a slab of meat. There s definitely no quality control at this spa and it s embarrassing.",

        "ReviewContent": "I went to Cavallo spa to celebrate a birthday. It was absolutely stunning and felt like you were in a forest, not 10min outside of SF.  They have private hot tubs for the mens and womens locker room and a co-ed heated pool. I got the original message and it was worth every penny. They have free parking. Only complaint would be that the spa address is not the actual location on their property (atleast according to maps) so our group got a little lost. Its located about 2 blocks away from the actual hotel lobby. Overall highly recommend and I will be returning.",

Womens Jacuzzi was perfection with both temperature and jets. Lots of spa water and cucumber washcloths which were a refreshing relief. My massage was a good old fashioned elbow centric Swedish. I just assumed they were 50  hours but my gf s came out 10-15 minutes later so I clarified, and I was indeed shorted 10 minutes. Ok all and all but doesn t leave a patron with a  good taste .

Her massage was good, but mine felt clumsy, rough, uncoordinated, and not very relaxing. The total for the couples massage was $370, which seems quite overpriced when Ive gotten better massages for far less. And when I wanted to tip my massage therapist less than my wifes, the clerk at the front desk seemed to turn sour and unfriendly on me. We also had access to the heated pool, hot tub, and other spa areas. The pool was in a pretty setting, but there were leaves, dead bugs, and a sheen of oil floating on top. The hot tub was very small and the glass tiling around it had unsightly mold growing under it. The locker room was very nice, though, with good skin care regimens available as well as a nice steam room. Overall, though, this place was not worth the price. At all.",

        "ReviewContent": "Really wanted to like this place!  Ive been to a lot of spas, but was super excited to try this one.  There are some really good points, but the negatives are too much for me to return.  Overall it felt like a high volume place, where people cycle in and out on que. Pros:  Staff is very friend, massage was good and masseuse very communicative.  Overall location is great and the seating area is very large and open.  As per all spas, they serve flavored water and hot tea.  The steam room was good, but again, small - maybe 4 people could fit without being crowded - see below....... Cons:  Crowded!!!  All the massages begin/end at the same time, so the locker room is filled with the next group, or those that just finished.  And its a small locker room, so about 8 ladies are all changing next to each other.  Only 2 showers.  Outdoor jacuzzi is small and can only hold 4 people comfortably.  The outdoor pool is also small with a lot of loungers surrounding the pool.  Maybe 6 people could be there; 8 would be crowded.  No reading material in the seating area - very odd for a spa. At the end of your massage, you exit your room, where all the masseuses are outside their room, waiting with a glass of water in their hand for their client to exit. This felt too commercial, high volume and not relaxing.  The area is beautiful, but too many people.",
