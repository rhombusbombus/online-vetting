The teachers, staff and retreatants made my experience unforgettable. This was a beautiful gift to myself and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Spirit Rock is a large property with vast hiking trails. Three hiking opportunities also made my time here even more special.",

Proceed with caution and listen to the dharma talks before you apply.... Also Im laughing at one of the other reviewers that said staff were rude to POC beings and would like to clarify some of the staff are rude to all beings and a true Dharma teaching and letting go and going to compassion... explore the monastic centers and other smaller centers. Might be a good experience for a first-time retreating however it is a big Institution 90 retreatments and they made the huge mistake of having double rooms meaning youre sleeping in a room with a stranger Im still laughing....metta",

As a person of color, I found all staff white, stand-offish and downright rude. I once went to the director because I had feinted before breakfast and she blew me off she did not even offer to set up an appointment to see a nurse. I would strongly recommend that if are a person of color or an ally you not bother going to this retreat site. It is a white enclave that claims to practice tantric Buddhism but instead acts completely like  appropriators  of an Asian-derived tradition who then go out and discriminate, ironically, against Asian American attendees.",

This Center is divine, orderly, and bursting with with radiant compassion. I especially recommend the quiet pagoda (apologies, I forget the name!) near the Meditation Center. This simple and humble wooden  gratitude  center contains a prayer wheel and walls filled with portraits of renown leaders, heroes, and devotees from so many loving traditions. Of particular interest to me are the handwritten dedications and offerings from people who guide my thoughts and actions so often they feel like (affordable) gurus and therapists who live in different rooms  inside  my head. The silence, peace, and compassion in the pagoda was so profound I felt firsthand what I can only term as the opposite of the Stendhal syndrome! My heartbeat slowed, my thoughts ceased, and even *I* had nothing left to say! I have no words that can convey the honor and grace of setting foot in a place of such deep restfulness and humility! My only thought upon reflection is    These are all simply human beings, just like me!   Right? If I could recommend a place of pilgrimage to anyone in the world, this place would have to make the shortest of the shortlists.",

It used to be a beautiful place of refuge many years ago where you could learn the Dhamma of the Buddha and practice meditation - one of the spiritual jewels of the Bay Area.  Unfortunately, now it is becoming inauthentic and obsessed with the ego promotion of teachers.  Their embrace of McMindfulness (Google this) by exploiting the Dhamma for financial gain is a big turn off, and has kept me away from Spirit Rock in recent years.  Wake up folks!  Buddhism is NOT a play thing for your own sense and ego gratification, it is a serious, egoless practice to help us liberate ourselves from suffering in samsara.",

        "ReviewContent": "I really wanted to go to one of their retreats. However, they make it mandatory to be fully vaccinated with AT LEAST 1 booster shot. Im tired of being bullied/coerced by organizations and government into getting this vaccine, when vaccines are not for everyone; even dangerous to a small population. Tired of these inclusive groups being so accepting on the caveat that you share their beliefs, ideals and opinions about what is right for YOUR individual being; i alone am in-tune with my body, i know what it needs, nobody else can/should make that choice for me. Im sure they are Pro-Choice and yet they dont want to give people the freedom to choose whether or not they wish to take a recently developed drug, before longitudinal studies can be conducted. There is plenty of data showing that the vaccine is not the ONLY way to build immunity to this very real virus. Some of us have very valid reasons to decline this drug. Still, those of us who do decline, arent forcing/coercing others to follow suit; do what you will with YOUR person. They are; LGBQT+ allies, BIPOC allies, Pro-Choice allies, etc. I praise them for accepting and empowering these communities and individuals, this is all good and wonderful; aligned with spirit as it should be.. They are accepting of everyone. Everyone that shares the same world view and disposition as they do. If you dont agree with that position, then you arent welcome to their facilities. Spirit Chains, psilocybin should be the next substance on your list of mandatory drugs for entry. Sincerely,  an Individual",

If you want to up-level your personal best, go to a silent meditation retreat here at Spirit Rock Meditation Center or find one near you. I left this retreat a kinder, more compassionate, more patient human being with more love for myself than ever before. I actually feel different in my own skin, which is quite amazing and as I look through my eyes I feel that Im looking through a different pair of lenses. I consider this place my Spiritual Home and I cant wait to go back. The simple daily rhythms could actually be difficult at times, but I never felt better. My body, spirit, heart/mind were nourished and filled up in a beautiful way. The combination of sitting, walking, working, eating on repeat, and going back to the absolute basics had me feeling alive and deeply connected to myself and the beautiful Coastal Miwok lands I was so honored to roam everyday. The phenomenal vegan/veg cuisine was probably the best gourmet food Ive ever tasted in my life!!! I am so grateful to my company for paying for this and allowing me this professional development time to upgrade myself. Cant wait to do this again this new year! Thank you Rockwood Leadership Institute for this gift!!! p.s. I dont have any pictures of the gorgeous food (we ate the rainbow) cuz we had no cell phones during the retreat. If you really want to upgrade your life, ditch your cell phone (schedule time away from it) talk less and listen more Xoxo #meditation #spiritrockmeditationcenter IG: rumaten8r1nk",

During the silent walking meditation period, there were so many people and we werent allowed to go to the main building area, so even though we were walking outside, people were too close to one another and had to spread out to parking area which wasnt very serene! I was really hoping that I could enjoy a serene and quiet space while attending the retreat but it was too crowded and restricted. The retreat itself was nice, but maybe it could be a little smaller and more intimate?  Also, the fact that we werent allowed to move around the ground in silent meditation felt too constricted.  It seems like a nice, spacious place but I felt too confined to one area. It would be really nice if one could just visit the spiritual place without so much confinement. I am used to visiting temples in Asia where everyone is welcome at any time because no matter how many people are visiting, it is always very quiet. I wish Spirit Rock could make itself available to people who seek a quiet place any time, even if they are not paying participant to any of their retreats.",
