As for the space Clean rooms. Small and simple. The atmosphere, fresh air, lush redwoods- all feel healthy and cared for with love. I liked the silence all around most parts of the day. Nice hiking trails along redwoods. The food is simple, clean, vegetarian and vegan. Tasty and creative. Wild turkeys and deer visit the grounds as they are used to people and not being disturbed. I am already looking to go back again",

Those who are religiously inclined will find the temple nice albeit a bit crowded on Saturdays. Overall very clean and well-maintained property. However - I was very disappointed with the activities I was planning to do. The Saturday afternoon Yoga class was replaced with something else (not updated on the website), Sunday Yoga class was removed (it was there when we made the reservation). Furthermore, food could be improved. Vegan food can be made tasty, can be kept warm for the duration of the dining hours. The server should be around for the dining hour. The tea bar could have a bit more fruits or other snack options. I would have wanted to come again if some of the basic needs were met.",

Unlike most of the bay area temples that are designed inside a simple hall, this temple is authentic in the design of a Hindu temple. It is specially dedicated to Hanuman ji and shiv ji. The surrounding area is blissful and serene. The drive to this place is also quite beautiful. Worth coming here for darshan and just spending some time in peace among the mountains.  There is a small shop that serves samosa and tea also. The place offers a retreat center and yoga center and overnight stay but I didnt experience those.",
