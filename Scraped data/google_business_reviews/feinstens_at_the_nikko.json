Great seats for the show and the cocktails were good.  Theres validated parking for up to 5 hours in the garage down the block.  You can walk to several restaurants and bars in the area before the show!",

Theres a parking structure right across the street and with validation from the hotel I think it came out to about $15. This location is absolutely beautiful! Yes, its inside of a hotel so you definitely need to go through the right entrance, and my friend walked me to the exact spot that we needed to come in through, maybe its the actual interest of the hotel but I dont know. All in all it is absolutely beautiful as a space! Very close knit, but still comfortable. They have a QR code for you to order drinks and a lovely cheesecake. Since I was the DD I decided not to drink and because we were going out to eat right afterwards. I didnt do any of the cheesecake, but our two other friends who accompanied us did get both a drink and a cheesecake and they said everything was absolutely lovely. I cant wait to come here for another show!",

Thanks to iconic Michael in the booth, the sound is always flawless. And the lighting is stellar. All other concert venues are forever ruined because no one sounds as good as they do in Feinsteins. The venue is so intimate that you walk away knowing how your favorite singer smells. You might even get a hit with nasty look from Seth Rudetsky, or nicked by an errant sequin from one of Broadway Barbaras fantastically high kicks. Never heard of the person performing? Not to fear: legendary tastemaker Randy Taradash doesnt let anyone on that stage unless theyre a brilliant performer. You might not know who youre seeing on a given day, but you can bet they will knock your socks off in the best way possible.",

They went upstairs to their restaurant kitchen to make me this drink (the coffee machine was not at the bar) . That was great service.

There isnt a bad seat in the house, very intimate and small so you can see and hear everything quite clearly from anywhere in the house.  The food is decent, for a while they didnt have some variety but I think it has gotten better.  Lots of great artists with really fun shows they put on.  Often times there will be a step and repeat after the show and you can meet the artists which is always fun.  The bathroom is located in the hotel lobby and they do unlock it during showtimes, but sometimes if you get there really early they will not have unlocked it yet.  The hosts are always great and quick to seat you.  Service is great and they do their best to bring the food out before the show starts so that it is not disrupting anyone.",

        "ReviewContent": "Great cozy venue to see your favorite Broadway star! Recently took my 16 year old daughter here for her birthday to see Adam Pascal & Anthony Rapp. To keep this review from getting to be too long, I will list the things I would want to know if I was considering buying tickets to an event. Facts: Feinstein s is located in Hotel Nikko in SF and is owned by singer Michael Feinstein. The venue holds roughly 120 people and is set up in a cabaret style. It is very cozy and I doubt there is a bad seat in the house. I    bought tickets 8 months prior to the event online. I found the event on Goldstar, but opted to upgrade to better seats and bought through ticket fly. Ticket prices vary per event but there are three sections to chose from. The back and far sides being the most economical, then the middle, and front. The seating is set up with small round tables that seat 2, down front and the center, with bigger tables on the sides and bars with stools around the edges of the middle section and back. You can chose your specific seats when purchasing online, but what you are really choosing is your price tier or section. That is because when you check in with the maitre d, you are then assigned a seat. The earlier you arrive, the better your seats. Doors open 90 minutes before the show, and it is definitely worth getting there around this time, or earlier if it is a hot artist. If you are disabled or have a large party you want to seat together they recommend calling their maitre d days and at the very least hours before doors open. You will find this number on their website under FAQ. There is a 20 dollar per person food/drink requirement, regardless of where you bought your tickets. This is easy to spend buy purchasing a few drinks or a light meal, or both! My daughter had their burger and a diet soda, I had a cup of tomato soup, and a thin Margarita Pizza and one alcoholic beverage and our bill was roughly 90 dollars. They do automatically tack on an 18% gratuity. All shows run roughly 60 minutes and there is no intermission. Parking is available either at the hotel via valet (they will validate you for 1 free hour) or on the corner of Mason & OFarrell there is a garage that will run you around 20 dollars, and I hear there is a cheaper garage farther down Mason, just past H & M. The Hotel in near Union Square so you can also take Bart to Powell and from there it is only a couple of blocks away. You must enter through the front of the hotel located at 222 Mason Street, San Francisco, California 94102.  If you are driving and planning to use their valet set your GPS to 180 Ellis Street to arrive at the driveway. Overall the club has a classy upscale feel to it. Dress would be date night, cocktail or business attire. No need for formal wear, but you dont want to show up in jeans either. Pros: You are so close to the artist that you feel like they are putting on a private show for you. Strawberry Fields alcoholic beverage is one of the best Ive ever had My daughter says their Kobe beef burgers are amazing. Contrary to other reviews Ive read the staff was very friendly. While the seating was definitely compact it was comfortable. After the show most of the artists will come out and take pictures with the guest. This is done in an organized manner with a line set up directly outside the door of the venue. Acoustics are great for one instrument and vocals, any more than that might be overwhelming. Minors are allowed in the venue, however I would recommend it for age 13 and up (or mature 10 to 12 year olds who love Broadway) Cons: With the tickets drinks and food and cost to park this can be a pricey night out. At 60 minutes the show seems a little short for the price you pay for the tickets. Tip: Ladies bring a small purse only as space is very limited. However their is a coat check need be. Make sure you visit their website for more info. Overall we had a great time, and my daughter left so giddy that the hotel guests probably thought she had been drinking.",
