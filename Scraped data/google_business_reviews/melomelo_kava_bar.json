We were surprised the place was packed, and everyone (including the servers), were so sweet and kind. The atmosphere was lush. Full of beautiful decor, a huge thriving plant wall, large windows, and numerous matching couches to sit soft on. They also have traditional bar seating. Their menu is great! Lots of options. You can order bucha on tap, or a flight to sample. They have a variety of kava strains, in which you can order it plain or choose a variety of kava mocktails. You can also order a variety of teas (green, black, yerba). I would 10/10 recommend this place! :)",

For those of you who don t know, kava is a sacred plant to many people, used in ceremonies with the chiefs to dispel arguments. I enjoy kava because it connects me to the root of my existence, of all of our existences  it connects me to the ocean. I miss swimming in the ocean, kava running through my blood. If I could advise anything, go to Hawaii, get kava drunk, and swim in the biggest waves you can brave. It s a life changing experience. I hope everyone who comes here can learn a little bit about the people of the ocean. Along those lines, it s best practice among many to dip your finger into the kava 3 times, and each time flick the kava droplet over each shoulder, and then in front of you. As far as I ve been told it s a way of honoring of those by your side, seen and unseen, and those in front of you, seen and unseen. Then, drink the whole shell (if it s not too cold).

It s cool drinking this root out of a coconut shell. it out of the My tongue was numb and I started to feel relaxed, happy, social and wanted to be nicer to people.
