        "ReviewContent": "Wonderful place, great energy, kind people, great offerings! My only reason for not giving 5 stars was being on the receiving end of a business policy with which I strongly disagree and hope will change. I was 10-15 min late to the 9am yoga class and wasnt able to get in the building. I waited outside for about 10-15 min and was about to leave when an employee walked by outside and noticed me and let me in. This was only half the battle and I also needed to get the attention of the people inside the yoga class via an open window to get in the next door. Once let in I was initially met with some friction, and was told that the doors lock 10 minutes after the start of yoga class out of respect for the teacher, and was told adamantly that thats the businesses policy. Now I certainly agree that students should make every effort to arrive on time. However, this is the real world in the SF Bay Area. People can be making a tremendous effort to get there, waking up at 7:30am, driving from 45 min away from the peninsula or Silicon Valley (as I did), people can get stuck in traffic, have trouble finding a parking spot. In my opinion turning such people away and leaving them locked outside for not arriving on time is cold and unfriendly, and not an approach that should be adopted by a healing center, whose goal is hopefully to spread love in the world. IMO doors should be open and customers/patrons should be welcomed with open arms. If certain people habitually arrive late each week, they can be talked to about it separately. I think this kind of balance and open mindedness is important in finding creative solutions to problems. Solutions that are uncreative and inflexible are usually rooted in some kind of fear, and should be what any kind of healing or spiritual center worth its salt should seek to transcend. I hope that in the future the policies of this center will be kind, accepting, and welcoming to all members, regardless of some occasionally poor punctuality ;)",

You can just sit anywhere there is space with anyone else and it s so cute and beautiful- great for making some new friends and meeting new people. They also have yoga available so that s awesome! I got the cacao and another turmeric chai and it was so calming. I think they add a bunch of herbs to it to give you that calming, relaxing effect. I definitely felt that. Would definitely go again, and get more chai here. Do check them out!!",

        "ReviewContent": "Mainly, Im very happy  that something like this exists! I attended an intimacy event with Victoria and it supported growth in my marriage - and thats huge. On the negative side, the Jasmine tea was the most Ive paid at $13 for a pot of tea, took 10 minutes to arrive and was not as good as any of the tea I have at home from three organic brands. Parking was a challenge. The door person for the event first refused to take cash, then could not read the card automatically and had to enter it in, then said her machine could not process our credit card and finally asked us to buy the ticket (with the same card) on event-brite and asked us to step out of the way from holding up the line. If you dont want to hold up the line its simple: accept peoples money, starting with cash. Stepping back, I think most relationships fail because of this protocol, expressed in various forms along these lines: Person A) I am not equipped to connect with you in a way that would be easy and graceful for you. Nor do I plan to fix that. If you want to relate to me you have to solve my incompetencies or leave. Person B) Why should I have to solve your problems... Im leaving. I do think its mildly paradoxical that a center to facilitate relationships and community is the least capable of accepting energy in the form of money of any business Ive encountered in many months, particularly in a context where most community enterprises fail due to lack of money and money competence. When I went to pay for my tea something similar happened: My first card did not read when I tapped it (it works everywhere else). They said that happens often so I tried another card, which did work, making it hard to pay for tea and very hard to pay for an event. I think it is far more important that centers for community exist than how well they accept money. I also think that community is a phenomena that succeeds or fails based on competency. The easiest way to measure the competency of flow objectively is around money. All communities in our culture require some amount of money to be sustainable. So money is important after all for what it tells. I would not expect the social competency of a group to be higher than their competency for managing money, which is 100 times easier than managing psyches.",

Im sorry that you had such a negative first experience with us. Ill speak with our volunteers about conduct behind the teabar; our card reader for Mindbody unfortunately doesnt work, which is likely why our volunteer recommended to make the purchase online. Ill update the wording in MBO to make it more clear the pass lasts for only a month. In the meantime, Ive extended your 3 class pass so it will now expire November 8th. Hopefully this is enough time so you can take a couple more classes :) Best always, Heather Teahouse Coordinator\", \"OwnerResponseDate\": \"2023-05-07 02:41:03.217935\", \"ReviewLikes\": 0, \"TotalReviews\": 2.0, \"LocalGuide\": 0.0}"

Out of nowhere, a rat just ran up inside my shirt, ran all over me, and bit me until I pulled it out. I was wriggling around for half a minute with a wild rat inside my shirt. I had to go to the emergency room right away. Multiple people saw this happen (including the venue organizer), and yet the concert was not stopped. No one else was informed that there was a wild rat running around. The person from the venue said they had 8 rat traps in place and couldnt understand how this had happened. Maybe hosting an event with over 50 people sitting on the floor wasnt the greatest idea if you have a known rat problem? No one bothered to call up later and check on me (despite having taken my friends number). The one silver lining was that the person at the venue offered me a first aid kit right away. I cannot believe something like this is taken so lightly. Having a wild rat running around which attacked someone is a huge health hazard to the audience. I cannot believe the event was organized in the first place, and even worse, continued despite the venue clearly knowing about the rat problem beforehand.",

Then walk up to the desk and order the tea you like. When I came here, I had a cold so I ordered the ginseng detox, recommended by one of the workers, and it cleared my sinuses right up. There are plenty of coxy little spots for you to cuddle up and read a book, or have an intimate chat with one another. The lighting is low and really makes the mood comfortable. I think its well worth it. If I lived here, I would definitely buy one. The workers that are here volunteer their time, they arent paid. The focus of this place is to create a community, make connections, heal, and transform yourself. I really wish we had a place like this where I lived. Everyone in here was so kind.

Well good luck getting on the list, everyone was standing on each other to get on the list (worst vibe ever).I finally got on one of the lists and they took me off, with out telling me.

I was super curious so I took the detour down the long walkway into what is now one of my most favorite tea spots in this city. You walk in and immediate feel a sense of calm and relaxation. The tea lounge is beautiful and worldly with a great combination of people from all walks of life. The business person taking a break from their busy day, to the writer who looks centered and focused on every written word. The travelers who just met but seem to share a special connection, embarking on a possible friendship. Everyone from all walks of life should stop in and take a moment for themselves. Grab a cup of tea and be mindful. You wont regret it.",

Its a chill atmosphere, warm, as our host put it, and this place offers wifi in additional to 5G (I believe) -- for free! I also find it easier to work in than some other places (at least in one of the rooms) with music playing and Im a person who likes to work in quiet spaces; though I do still wish the music was softer, if not nonexistent. They also have these AWESOME cushions on which you can sit and they are REALLY comfortable, offer great support, and are probably good for posture. Im actually going to look into getting one for myself. Lastly, they have a separate room that can host classes which I find unique, great for individual and community betterment, and cool. *Disclaimer: I was offered a free pot of tea in exchange for a review.",
