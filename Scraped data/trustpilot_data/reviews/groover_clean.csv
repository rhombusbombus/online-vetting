6582e411172d268dc239c7c2,5,Inexpensive and nice platform to promote music,"I'm both an artist and a curator and Groover. It was the first platform that I used to promote my music on Spotify since the German copyright collective GEMA has a collaboration with them.What I really like about the platform is how inexpensive it is. Some other companies charge you multiple hundred Euros but on Groover you can select very precisely which curators you want to send your track and if the price (usually 2-4€) is worth it for you. You need to invest some hours to check each playlist and if it's a good fit for your track but it pays off because you keep your advertising costs relatively low and have a higher acceptance rate. Of course, most curators will delete your track after a couple of weeks from their playlist (as on all platforms) but on a fresh release, the streams from the playlists can potentially help to get enough momentum to get featured on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly. It's kind of a ""putting oil on fire""-effect. In a few cases, I got lucky and my track didn't even get deleted from the playlists. A thing to mention is the super-friendly support. One or two curators have accepted my track in the past but then didn't add it to their playlists for weeks (probably because they forgot). I reached out to the support and got a full refund.As a curator, I really like Groover to discover new music for my playlist. You have 7 days to listen to a track and make your decision. After making your decision you get some money for your time and effort. The sorting system works really well. It's quite rare that I receive a track that completely doesn't match my playlist genre.

It’s refreshing to engage with a platform where the coverage feels genuinely about the music, not just the money.

65714c9404995ab72379f787,1,Groover.com Playlist Curators: A Musical Scam,"NEW ADDITION TO PREVIOUS REVIEW""I have been disappointed with my experience on Groover and feel the need to add further details to my negative review. I reiterate my unfavorable judgment on the platform, which has proven useless in providing the desired visibility. The curators seem more interested in their compensation than actual expertise in the industry, dispensing advice without a solid foundation.Speaking of the staff, I had contact with what I believe to be the manager, who, after some unconvincing explanations to justify the issues encountered, claimed they are working to improve the situation (which I found rather ironic). Subsequently, he proposed to talk to the staff to find curators who might consider my track for their playlists, as those I had chosen were deemed too ""demanding.""After a few days, a staff member contacted me to inform that, after careful listening, they had compiled a list of curators to whom I could submit my track. I was surprised to find that most of these proposed curators had no affinity with the genre of my music. I wonder, if those considered ""demanding"" rejected it, what will those who promised to include it but haven't done so, possibly just to earn a few more coins, do?This incident has led me to reflect on the fact that if curators show a lack of seriousness, the staff is no different. I advise staying away from Groover; I am aware that this warning may not be heeded by everyone, as there will always be inexperienced users ready to fall into the trap. However, if I can save even just one person from the experience I went through, I will consider my goal achieved.""PREVIOUS REVIEWMy experience with the so-called ""playlist curators"" on Groover.com has been an absolute disaster and a perfect example of how some unscrupulous individuals are just looking to make a quick buck without providing any real value to artists.First and foremost, it's evident that many of these curators update their playlists so infrequently that it seems like they're putting in the bare minimum effort. Receiving feedback from them is like searching for a needle in a haystack, and when it does come, it's so generic and random that you wonder if they've truly listened to your music.The lack of professionalism becomes apparent when you consider that they might completely overlook high-quality tracks that, for instance, have been featured on shows by well-known artists like Armin van Buuren. It's clear that they have no real expertise in assessing musical quality, and it seems like their sole objective is to make some easy money at the expense of artists.Personally, I got the impression that many of these curators are little more than digital scammers, certainly not music experts. I strongly advise against spending a single penny with them. There are better and more reputable alternatives out there that deserve your time and money.In conclusion, if you're looking for a platform that values your work and connects you with competent and passionate playlist curators, Groover.com is certainly not the right choice.

6557b1498af162c55d489198,3,"Not a bad service, worth a try","I’ve used Groover a few times this year. I’ve had mixed results and mixed feelings. Erica has helped me write song pitches and an artist biography and she’s been very nice. I’ve gotten a few playlist placements and feedback from some sources that has made an impact and been very good for me to read and hear. A lot of rejections from curators , which isn’t surprising, as I only recently started distributing my music and trying promotion services. Most rejections contain decently useful feedback. Some of the acceptances I’ve gotten had little measurable or noticeable impact. That was frustrating. To pay money, get a bunch of rejections, and then have a few acceptances be almost useless because someone put me on a TikTok or Instagram story for maybe a day (with no links or audio of my stuff, so what was the point of that?). I have gotten a few acceptances and playlist placements that have gotten me a couple hundred streams and people kept my songs available which was good. It does take time to go through all the curators but they have a useful set up and filters. It just depends on what you prefer: would you like to go through curators and contact them yourself and get feedback, or would you rather pay another service who does the pitching for you? Overall, it’s not a bad service but it’s very difficult to get your songs on playlists or social media placements or in radio that make actual significant impact. Is it worth the money? Eh. Just be careful. You can spend hundreds of dollars and just get yourself a few more social media followers and a couple hundred streams.

64da41be1bc0ed3ad351431e,3,Cool platform but low success.,"I've run multiple campaigns on Groover for music promotion. You exchange real money for a weird fictional currency called Grooviz, which makes no sense. I guess it's supposed to make it easier to throw money away? You use those to pitch your song to different ""professionals"" many of whom are playlisters. I've had various degrees of success getting either listed or rejected by the playlisters. Many of them are extremely niche and will reject your music for all matter of obscure reasons. Many of them say they accept specific genres of music, but they actually do not. I would say half of them don't even know what those genres are, even though the platform tries to make it clear. Make sure to listen to their playlists very carefully because if your music is not almost identical to what they've accepted in the past, it is highly likely to be rejected. The criticism can be rather harsh too and sometimes they can get rude about it, as though you paying them to listen to your music is an inconvenience to them. As for getting accepted onto a playlist... I've been playlisted on about 127 of them now from Groover. The conversion rate for plays and followers is minimal. Our average return from this was about 10-50 plays per playlist per year with a few outliers. It works out to about 7-10 plays per dollar spent, which is a terrible ROI.

646cabc8363a169836bf5f4a,1,Dont waste your money on Groover,"Just had a campaign with Groover as a new artist, spent 100 euros for 52 pitches to so called various ""playlist curators"" around the world. While getting a reply from most of them I can't really tell how many are fake and how many real, many feedback mesages sounded so similar in wording leading me to believe those are actually Groover own bots, a lot of them liked the song but chose not to add it to their playlists sometimes for very silly reasons, some saying song is good but production is not, others saying production is excellent but the song is not, hilarious. Overall I can only blame myself for starting this campaign with groover, mostly for trying to see how real and good they are. I have been added only to 2 or 3 playlists - very small playlists, resulting in 0 streams on Spotify. The fact that Groover works with such small playlist curators speaks a lot about how serious Groover is. They are only interested to get your money and there is no way to find out how big the curator playlist is when you are chosing curators from their list, eventually you will find out if you are added to one or few and then you are checking them individually on your Spotify app. You will get blinded by a huge list of 2k curators, labels etc for all music genres without a clue how big they are and if the size of a particular one is worth your 2 euros/per pitch fee. Total Ripp off.So if you are a new artist like me, do not waste your money with Groover, is not worth it. I now understand that if you are a decent artist the only way to succeed is the Label way, where you pitch to a major label and get eventually signed then the label will take care of your advertising campaign, otherwise your song(s) will lie hidden on Spotify without nobody decovering it. Or go Groover way if you want to waste your money to some real and some fake curators, the real ones will be mostly curators of small playlists which wont help even if they add your song to their insignificantly small playlists.I guess the number of feedback Groover has on Trustpilot speaks volumes about how popular and old in the game Groover is. Groover main  interest is only to share your fee with so called curators in their list, they have no regards whatsoever for you as an artist or your music, they will only try to paint the fake image of themselves as a great way to promote your music when the reality is very different.",2023-05-23T14:04:24.000Z,"May 22, 2023",Adrian Avel,6,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/646cabc8363a169836bf5f4a,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60fef81dfe8ed50018318159,Dont waste your money on Groover,dont waste your money on groover,"Just had a campaign with Groover as a new artist, spent 100 euros for 52 pitches to so called various ""playlist curators"" around the world.

There is no one on earth that is a listener of music more than a musician. So frankly I'm not impressed by the position of a ""curator"" - listening to dozens of un-known tracks it's what I do on daily basis. Without being paid for it - just to keep my ears open to the world. Music is a necessity - just like ordinary food - it's food for the soul. Not asking for paid streaming at all. Asking for fair pricing. Since those who listen are being paid - it makes them a workers for money. Not for music. They are not being punished with each track - they are being paid. So from this poistion of - just like journalist writing a review - they might think they are above it all (not all of them surely). We work for music. And our work is music. In order that we profit from our music - we must cut all of those leeches that are trying to make money on our expense. There used to be a lot of them - Photographers, Graphic designers, Managers, Lawyers,  Recording Studio owners, Club and stage owners, DJs, Labels, and many more job holders - that wouldn't have any job (that's including you) if there were no musicians. The new industry is all about putting the music makers in the right place. We don't need most of those job holders any more.Just make sure that you are in the right side of history and not belong to the past...I can feel read and understand  that you honor musicians. But I must make that remark again - it's not about the competitation with 100K others tracks. Since we are working in music we already made our own path.All I said it  must be cost effective. Replying to Groover reply:Sorry man - paying for someone to listen to your track should be cost effective. By making them ""experts"" you lower the musician to the place of being - not expert. All they have to do is pick whatever they like. Enough for your system feedbacks spam on our band email. You didn't pick our song - I don't care about why. It's totally ok. But it's not ok to sell a story of a promoting site that is doing nothing but spam. You can offer a pack of 50 listeners for 20$We have no problem spending 2000$ on your site if we know it's doing something with a value.And having the time to delete feedbacks from Trustpilot and spend your own time on poetic arrogant replying won't change the fact the what you do is simply - exploitation of naive  musicians for your own needs - well nothing new here. This is how the old music industry worked and still working toady. You invented nothing new but continue the old tradition. Sorry manhood - This must co cost effective for us all. Otherwise - it's unjust and you are selling a fake story. I'm sure it's great for some people - but having you deleting all the bad reviews here - we'll never know the truth.

I think because they have so many curators now and a lot of them have pretty small playlists on Spotify.","groover is the only platform ive used for promotion of my songs (mainly on spotify) it all works well. the feedback of my songs are often a bit odd sometimes, but that maybe because there are a fair few non english  speaker curators. i can't say i'm over exited about groover, as even when many curators accepts a song and shares it, i can't say i notice much of a positive impact on my plays. i think because they have so many curators now and a lot of them have pretty small playlists on spotify."

A good reputation is difficult to achieve and seconds away from being destroyed, so far so good for Groover","as the saying goes ""nothing is perfect"" groover provides a platform for musicians and their representatives to present the music to a range of possible outlets (curators, influencers etc) and the platform itself is fantastic. it achieves very well indeed the idea of channelling musical art to possible market outlets. where it can be difficult is if the musicians do not categorise their music properly or the curators etc do not properly communicate the music they are looking for. my attitude is nothing is perfect and you take the good with the bad (overall) groover along with the alternatives is achieving a valuable service to independent music artists. in fact it is one of the better platforms, for instance i have given up on submit hub due to their failure to achieve a database that is accurate, in other words the artist send their music to curators who are really not interested or who are down right dishonest and collect the money for reviews that i'm believe they have copied and pasted. this is the impression i have had anyway.... groover are, so far, achieving in a difficult space that is relatively new and evolving....for me  i am delighted with their achievement but would at the same time caution them to avoid letting the same problems that have infected others develop in their service delivery. keep it up and watch for insincere listings on the one side and questionable content quality on the other. a good reputation is difficult to achieve and seconds away from being destroyed, so far so good for groover"

If you're charging more then 1-3 dollars a submission, and it's the EXACT SAME concept and curators as the cheaper service, then why charge so heavily for submissions? And yes, music is always subjective, but if someone spends 70 dollars on submitting music, and literally one person approves the song, and their acceptence rate is 100%, then theres probably something wrong with this system. All of the genres I picked belonged to my song, and yet people kept saying ""Good song, not for my playlist"". The site says spend more and send to more curators for the best results, but if I spend 70 bucks and got zero acceptence, would 30 bucks make that noticable of a difference for me? But yeah, 1/5 for this one, solely on the system, submission costs, and what I got out of it for spending 70 dollars. 70 dollars could've gotten me literally 70 submissions on Submithub, and they average 19% acceptance.",2021-10-16T00:56:16.000Z,"October 16, 2021",Raj,3,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/616a233075069a4da486aaa7,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5fc8c63d89262c001b2eade5,Overpriced Submithub,overpriced submithub,"Honestly the site looks nice, but spending 2 euros/five bucks per submission is ridiculous.
