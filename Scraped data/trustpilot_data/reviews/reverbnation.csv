6255ae042b3c3c43cfd0b7a4,reverbnation,2022-04-12 16:51:16,"User of 3 years: I used the site for about 3 years and have pretty good perspective.  Obviously, I'm not rating it well for some strong reasons, so I'll start with those.   First - many better music distribution options (CD Baby, Distrokid, etc) that have a 1 time setup fee and then perpetually collect royalties.  Reverbnation charges more, charges yearly, and takes a bigger cut.  And - if you don't use reverberation for distribution, you have NO WAY of collecting royalties for plays on their site...no matter how many.   Second - the whole ""charts"" is a sham, and its a way for them to sell you promotion for plays that rank your chart.   Third - you are primarily marketing to other musicians and bands, which is just kinda flawed entirely.   Fourth - the yearly fees for use are not in line with other options.   Fifth - opportunities - regardless of having many songs ""curated"" by the site, I've only been sent through to maybe a couple ""opportunities"" (which many of those opportunities are available free with just a little searching).     There are SOME positives.  Their AD sets seem to actually publish to decent sites, but I don't think are as cost effective as other marketing options.  The ADs seem to be ""rigged"" to where they throttle the amount of ADs displaying your songs to achieve a certain amount of exposure and pull back AD count if you getting too many plays, I've seen this.   They seem to allow 10%-20% views to plays ratios, but if you start exceeding that (and I have), they throttle back the amount of ads.   It's a strange thing.

I submit regularly to opportunities & was never accepted by anyone offering anything. On several occasions, I paid for the crowd reviews. My songs would get great comments except for 2 or 3 who would give me a 1/10 or some other abysmal review with comments that didn't even apply to the song or were clearly wrong ( poor off-beat piano playing - for a song with no piano, terrible recording quality - for a song recorded in a real studio by a pro with an ""A-list"" resume).

I guess because Reverbnation didn't get paid instantly they just pull all of your tracks.Half my tracks were missing from my page as well or de-activated because I had a Premium membership too which didn't renew because I hadn't logged in to put my new card details in. So beware of that if you upload in Lossless formats like .Wav and you have a Premium account these tracks will disappear if you do not pay up.Finally I ordered a couple of Crowd Reviews, on one track I was rewarded 4/10. It was baffling to read with some people saying that the Vocals and Singer were 'Excellent' and then I got this comment from someone ''The only redeeming thing about this song is the music which is lovely. The person ""singing"" has a voice that will give anyone a headache, like nails on a chalkboard.''Now if you ask me that is just plain abusive and that wasn't even the worst comment that I received in this Crowd Review. I understand that my voice isn't the best at the moment, just started vocal training again as my school has been closed for nearly 2 years in the pandemic.

I got some free credit and ran a 'video' campaign recently of a song promoting a youtube video I had made of a brand new song. The feedback from the promotion said that it had gotten '231' video plays. On you tube they had not moved. Even now the song only has 158 views. I appreciate that youtube and reverb nation obviously use different criteria for a 'play'. But what use is a 1 second burst of a video? Should they be counting that as the only data to indicate a successful campaign? I am going to stop using it. It seems a lot like vanity publishing. Many other avenues with a bit more integrity.

I dunno how many times I've had to look back at sales and thumb through 1 of however many hundreds of 10 result tabs to reconstruct a spreadsheet I should be able to download instantly. There are plenty of examples of bad support or no support (IE just closing my open tickets with little or no explanation. Currently one of our most regarded and reputable artists was taken down due to suspicious streaming. This was a flag sent by stores and there is no explanation other than, you agreed in TOS not to do this, end of story. There is no way this was carried out by the artist and all revenue is frozen. This was relating to streaming revenue only and they are withholding all revenue which they have no answer for when opening support tickets asking why.The other huge issue is that I am not able to withdraw certain artists royalties. This time we uploaded the wrong w-8ben information at the start of 2020 and re uploaded the corrected form once WE noticed the issue. Some of our artists tax information was corrected and some wasnt. I opened a ticket and support advised I update the w-8ben form we've already updated multiple times, ticket closed. This has been ongoing since the beginning of the year and we've received zero support.To sum up, do not under any circumstances use reverbnation unless you are into constant headaches. This company was the best deal ""back in the day"". They obviously have done nothing to evolve since. Go with distrokid, its free and it works. Oh and one more thing.

With the number of bad reviews that appear, there has to be something to them,  if not now, at one time. Maybe some folks are still having issues.I haven't encountered one site that offers you much help or support with your musical endeavors if you aren't a member. They're a sector of the service industry. Its a business, and if they aren't making money off of paid ads like social media, they have to make it somewhere. I paid for the basic subscription, 20 bucks. I have not had them charge my credit card for any services I did not ask for. That is important. Trust is a big deal.I've had other services that wanted much more money that to do the same thing I getting from Reverb. And they RN isn’t the only place I'm promoting myself, so some of the work is up to the artist.I did not pay Reverb Nation to play or stream any of my music. I do that myself. They haven't given me any issue about it. They have not said to me verbally or in writing that if I paid them  ""just xxxx.xx dollars, We'll do xxxxx for you"". I have gotten no hard sells. If they have made issues with people, then they need to fix them.I'm having my own site built and it will be my hub, but you have to spread yourself around to get known. So I find this sites and some similar to it useful. You need to have a game plan, know what it is you want out of a site and then do a little reading and decide if the site can deliver. So far, I have not had a negative experience on Reverb Nation. I'm big on giving the thumbs up or down, which ever a business earns based on what they do or don't provide. My time with Reverb Nation has been good. If they started giving me the run around, I would not hesitate to give them the lowest rating possible.So far so good.

We had to sent up the paypal payment etc so payment would be made if we carried on using the promotion tool after the freebie ran out, fair enough.We cancelled the the freebie as it was about to expire as you do but were charged £15. We though okay, we may have just missed the cancellation time so let it go and made sure the promotion tool was definitely deactivated on the account.Anyway, the following month we were charged another £15, no warning (also the charge that shows up doesn't actually say what it is payment for...just Reverbnation).At this point we cancelled the Paypal payment and contacted the bank (with the way fraud and internet banking fraud is today, you have just got to be careful).Reverbnation support was also contacted and it came to light that the payments taken were actually for using there premium account which we were not aware of. When getting the free promotion, it turns out we couldn't have that without being on the premium account which charges.Obviously we misunderstood and the initial response we had was actually okay advising us how to deactivate this and they would refund the last payment.

Solely to raise awareness about these activities.1. From the moment I had become a member, ReverbNation urged me to try to promote my music by using their tools and features. Naturally they only highlight the 3 day free trial and hide the small letters and conditions. A lot of companies do this, but still, there are limits to these shady ways of promoting. Let me explain:2. At first I was cautious about using my credit card, but what the heck. What’s the worst that can happen? It’s a LEGAL platform and surely they’ll have the decency to ASK ME if I would like to continue with a paying premium plan and clearly mention how much I would be paying. One would think that, right?3. Well, they don’t! After the 3 day trial (I DID NOT GET ANY NOTIFICATIONS about payments) Reverberation started using my credit card details to take 70 DOLLARS EACH WEEK for something I presumably had signed up for. Fortunately I saw this when I received my bill from my MasterCard. Unfortunately, by then, ReverbNation had already taken 450 DOLLARS (!!) of my bank account without my permission or without even giving me the option to continue or cancel, which is usually standard procedure with online payments. Even your laptop asks you if you are sure you want to continue or cancel every time you click on something (I mean, come on!)4. When I addressed customer support with this misunderstanding, I was expecting some “support” (hence the name “customer support”) in this matter and hopefully some refunding, because I didn’t even use these so called services I paid for. But no, over 3 times I received a standard reply referring to some small letters in a multi-paged agreement/disclaimer. Sorry, I’m lying, I did get a refund offer of 19,95 eur (of 450 dollars) for some reason.5. Well there you go people. That’s what’s wrong in today’s society. Soul -and heartless companies that thrive on the backs of hard working people. Providing a dishonest service that highlights the “join us! it's free!”, under cover of legal loopholes to ensure they get their money, with or without your permission.
