65b98307a33f33e6370dcf08,1,SCAM ARTISTS. AVOID!!!,"FEBRUARY 7, 2024 UPDATE: The merchant even lies in his response by making up quotes and falsely ascribing them to me. How pathetic. I hope this review will keep other artists from falling for the merchant’s elaborate scam. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Dont make the mistake that I made by trusting these crooks. Don’t be fooled by the usual fake reviews from employees and friends and family of the business owner. This “company”’s social media promotion service is a SCAM. If that’s your thing, you can get the same fake followers and bots from other similar companies for a FRACTION of what these people charge. I had to rewrite almost entirely the blog article that their so-called journalist wrote after interviewing me. Her writing was at or below high school level. I had a surge in INACTIVE TikTok followers over a few hours on one day and ZERO after that. Likewise, the one song that I hired the company to promote got thousands of views on YouTube overnight, all at once, but none of the other videos on my YouTube channel received one single additional view, and I gained ZERO new YouTube follower during the fake campaign that the “company” ran for me. Marc Carlton and Therese Dominique O. Lopez are both SCAM ARTISTS and will soon face legal consequences for defrauding musical artists looking for authentic exposure and promotion.

63c8349d4d0773066a3c254c,1,If I could give zero stars,"If I could give zero stars, or negative stars, I certainly would. ""Scammers"" are the first word I would use to describe Starlight PR. They took credit for every bit of self-promotion I did on the back-end, in an attempt to rescue my release from falling victim to their almost completely useless $4,200 promotion package. First of all, they assigned a junior writer to craft my press release, who absolutely botched it... the writer failed to form complete sentences, and the majority of the bio/press release was entirely incoherent. I had to rewrite it as best I could, seeing as how Starlight failed to take any responsibility for the abhorrent quality when I notified them. Being on a tight release schedule, this was immensely stressful, and overall detrimental to the release of my record. After I spent ten hours rewriting the press release to give it some semblance of coherence, I sent it back to Starlight with a sharp admonishment, and in response, they began a nasty email thread, arguing with me about how great their employees are and how wonderful their work is. At this point, I felt trapped, as I had entrusted Starlight with my first release, and had already passed their refund deadline with no other promotion strategies in place. In our initial phone consultation, Shealin had repeatedly assured me that Starlight PR was properly equipped, and maintained the appropriate industry connections, to promote my solo instrumental acoustic guitar album. In reality, they copy/pasted the garbage press release (which I had spent so much time and energy attempting to salvage, but which in the end was like polishing a piece of trash) into ten different RAP MUSIC ""blogs"" and ""magazines"", the vast majority of which were front companies with no readership or social media following. After learning that their ""ten to fifteen reviews in top blogs and magazines (like SMASH Mag and Pigeons & Planes)"" actually meant them copy/pasting my press release into exactly ten fake websites which did not even rank in a google search, I furiously emailed them, to which they responded again by arguing that their services and employees are ""actually VERY good"". I received ZERO organic streams, ZERO real social media follows, and almost no overall results from this $4,200 promotional campaign. The small amount of streams and TikTok follows which they generated were clearly from fake accounts, and resulted not only in ZERO engagement, but negatively affected my social media presence by cluttering it up with bots. The writers whom they hired to review my album wrote about it in such a way that indicated they had not even listened to it, and the playlists that Starlight secured for my songs included ""70s, 80s, 90s Smash Hits"" and a Portuguese ""Guardians of the Galaxy Soundtrack Playlist"". Oh, and out of the several podcast and radio interviews which they secured, the majority of them were largely centered around rap music, which was completely inappropriate for my album, and the majority of the interviewers clearly had never listened to the music, let alone prepared for the interviews, and were unable to represent the music effectively to their minuscule audiences. On a positive note however, a couple of the radio interviews and articles were relatively well done. Publicist Kurt Beyers wrote a decent article for SMASH Mag, and an iHeart Radio syndicated show that actually seemed professionally run was a pleasant surprise. But all in all, the promotional campaign was entirely ineffective for generating new followers, streams, or any kind of engagement with the music.95% garbage, 5% half-decent, 100% not worth a quarter of what was charged.

The Spotify/YT campaign is obviously botted: I suddenly had hundreds of people follow me in a single day and none thereafter and then Spotify then slashed all those botted followings from me, as well as removed my radio from my page because of the botted streams, so in the end I had zero value for my money.

6188dee775069a4da49c5c6c,1,$3200 ZERO STREAMS!!!!!,"I thought I'd try the $3000 package with $200 extra for the ""Twitter/Instagram Takeover"". It's been 3 months now. I HAVE ZERO STREAMS!! I've done 6 interviews. I've been placed in 4-5 look-alike blog sites (I'm almost sure ALL of these ""blog sites"" are owned & operated by SCAMLIGHT PR...I mean Starlight PR) I've made it into TWO ONLINE publications ""MTV Next"" & ""Hip Hop Weekly."" It took OVER 2 MONTHS for their publicist ""Jenna"" to revise & send in my interview to ""Hip Hop Weekly""!! This completely DEFEATED the reason WHY I hired this 🤡 🤡 🤡 company in the first place!! I wanted to promote my EP which was supposed to be released at the SAME TIME that ALL of this $3200 PR was going on like the ONLINE PUBLICATIONS!! The HIP HOP WEEKLY article should've BEEN published at the time of my EP release!! NOT 2 MONTHS LATER!!!! Out of the six interviews I did two were for ONLINE magazines. The third was for five identical hokey looking blog sites. The other three interviews went like this. One interview was for a podcast called: ""Bandwagon Radio"" (I spoke to the owner he said it was a brand new podcast like 30 days old. He said they have ""about 50 listneners"") The second ""Radio interview"" was done through a North Carolina hip hop station that I'm pretty sure the DJ kept screwing with me? His voice would sound really far away? Whenever I confronted him it was like he would pick the phone back up & his voice would get closer? Then he would put the phone or mic down & his voice would get further away. So this is what I paid $3200 for? To be treated like 🗑? My last interview was another call in to an online radio station. The guy put me on the spot & asked me to rap or recite poetry? It would've been nice to have known these things prior to the interview! Maybe my ""account manager"" ""Chris"" should've mentioned that I might be asked to perform or recite poetry on this last interview. Luckily, I had some poetry to recite. Fast forward to now. It's been OVER 3 months. I still have NOT received even ONE STREAM!! This entire campaign is nothing but ONE BIG FRAUD! I should've known right from the start whenever my very first interview scheduled for a Saturday evening at 9pm with ""Jenna"" was abruptly canceled at 8:47pm the day of the interview via an email from Chris. I should've just canceled this whole 💩 package. All these people do is LIE! LIE! LIE! Chris actually offered to interview me because he knew I was getting skeptical. But look I didn't pay $3200 to get interviewed by my ""account manager"". Nor did I spend $3200 to NOT receive ONE STREAM in THREE PLUS MONTHS! Whenever I finally did my first interview for the blog sites. I began asking the ""publicist"" questions. I asked ""how did you get a job working for this company?"" He goes on to say he's actually a ""close friend of Chris""? I should've figured this was all just one BIG SCAM SHOW! I had enough with this FAKE promo company! I asked a awhile back which would've been 3 months into my $3200 campaign ""what's going on with the Twitter/Instagram Takeover?"" Chris now has a MAJOR attitude with each email he chooses to respond to. He tells me ""this is a process. We could do it whenever you want"". I understand this is a ""process"". But I mean C'MON! $3200 & 3 months later after 6 interviews, 2 online publications, 3 completely worthless podcast/radio interviews & now a Twitter/Instagram Takeover? What good would this even be? So I provided my Instagram account info. I noticed about 15-20 new followers which lasted for less than 24hrs! I still have NEVER received ANY of the following PROMISES: 1) Source Magazine feature! 2) REAL organic results! 3) ANY streams to my music! 4) Twitter Takeover...At this point I'm cutting my loses & filing a dispute with my bank for $3200! If you took the time to read my whole review then DO NOT make the same mistakes as me! This company aka SCAMLIGHT PR is NOTHING but a LEGIT SCAM!! The positive reviews are obviously ALL FAKE!

Because of Spotify play-listing my release were flagged and taken down and now I’m not able to collect royalties from all the work I’ve put into promoting my catalogue. I’m extremely devastated because I purchased the full on 6 week campaign for my new song and now it’s not even available on platforms nor can I monetize on it. The Twitter take over feels like was also a waste of time. They ask questions from their own related accounts for an hour and then that’s it .There is no point for that .
