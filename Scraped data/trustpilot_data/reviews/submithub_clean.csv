This brought them up to two from one star in my opinion. If you are an artist with a big budget who is trying to find out where you fit in the industry, I think the service could be valuable. For the cost, I think you’re better off promoting your own playlists through social media marketing. The platform does not consist of the players you need to get your music out to the listeners. Even if you do make it on their playlists, you’re going to spend more money on “credits” than you would have spent on social media marketing through sponsored ads (with far more engagement on social media ads). You have a very low chance of being added to their curators playlists. Most of the artists on their playlists are mainstream, commercially successful acts. You have much more pull through your leverage of social media marketing. Unless you are seeking feedback from mid-level curators who can help you refine your sound to better target your audience, SubmitHub doesn’t offer anything that you cannot do for yourself with a little research and determination.

First of all, tbh it's not a promotion website.

You can hit some jackpot, but it's not really guaranteed (nothing is actually). But the fact that some of them just write up offensively lousy feedback to get the credits you're paying, really really is a big cringe factor. Like, dude, your commentary is not worth 3-4 credits especially when you only hardly listen to 1 minute of a 4 min long track. Helloooo, I can see which parts you have listened to or which parts you have skipped through the platform (I really like this feature btw). On the other hand though, you get some decent and conscientious ones that refund you when you don't like your song or simply don't have enough space in their lists to promote it (I gave it 2 stars only for those ones' sake).

650cca76229e419fb2988b59,1,Feedback hurts us all.,"The problem I see here isn't necessarily Submit Hubs fault but the end product kinda sucks nonetheless. Submit Hub, in my opinion tries to postion itself as the go to place for independent artist which is great, but the problem is the curators are not looking for the independent artist sound, thus leading many users feeling mislead. The playlisters want the proven formula and most things that are not that will probably not get accepted. Unfortunately, this discourages artists to be more creative and encourages a more conforming attitude towards music. I only write this as I truly believe this is more detrimental to the industry than a artist not getting any views at all. Feedback is great to help you improve, the problem here is you have to be very skeptical about the curators providing the feedback. All you got to do is check out some of the music the these curators put out themselves and you'd be shocked at the people telling you to change things. Last thing I'll add, is its seems everyone is in a echo chamber. Submit Hub itself, the users and the curators have all seem to have forgotten that people are paying for a service, the idea behind all of this is to streamline the process for the artist to get the music heard, not everyone makes good music understandably, and the market is very oversaturated, again not Submit Hubs fault but all this together makes many question what is the point of the website?

64c92fc19f9604539f5ffe79,2,Can't spend standard credits because curators have reached their daily limits & 'Hot Or Not' is Not So Hot!!,"I thought I'd give Submit Hub a try  - I really like the way it's set up and I found it very easy to quickly get to submitting a track to curators. I thought I'd try the standard credits first and then maybe move over to premium credits. My disappointment and frustration came when trying to use my allotted standard credits I found that I was only getting 1, 2 or 3 curators in my search and they weren't that accurate a match for my genre selection. When I clicked the 'show hidden' box I got much better results but the majority were hidden because they had 'reached their daily limit for new submissions'.

63faa3b3378f541418ed5fb5,2,Promote via other means.,"Here is my experience. I produce prog music and have a following of a sorts, prior to using Submithub. On SubmitHub, for a time I tested submitting my band's prog music to ""curators"" who cite prog as a genrr they like. The interface gives very little control or incite into these users. More on that later. So you submit your song to these people who apparently enjoy or specialise in your genre. Having submitted multiple songs in the prog genre, and spending a fair chunk of money as a test, the type of feedback you receive clearly shows a lack of match. For example, as a prog artist showing tracks to prog curators, I have received such feedback:""The track is too long"". ""The song is too alternative for our playlists"". ""The intro was a bit long for my liking"". ""The structure is not concrete enough, and missing a more traditional chorus"". ""The song is not mainstream enough"". ""The song is too guitar based""""The song is too edgy""Etc. So if you're reading this and write music that falls into prog (or anything other than pop or mainstream), then you know that such comments come from someone who does not listen to alternative music, and you will suffer this same problem. A look at the top performing tracks shows a preference for hip hop and cheese pop. This is fine, but the website pushes the ability to share your track with other genres, and those curators that capture your attention falsely label their interest, IMO. The issue I think, as an artist submitting music on SubmitHub, is multiple:1 - the curators are not explicit enough with their labeling in preferred genre. Or, if they are, they are completely wrong and uneducated about it. Which is a whole other problem. And shows more about the type of people that sign up as a curator. 2 - curators are clearly not music experts. They will cite non-existent production problems. And in every one of these cases, they cite erroneous feedback about production issues that relate not to technical production/mixing, but personal preference to the song or choice of instrument, out of context with the song and irrelevant to the production, and every time you'll have feedback from some other curator on the site suggesting the opposite. ""Vox too quiet / vox too loud / guitar unecesary / needs more guitar / mix too obvious / production too safe / muddy mix / etc"".  Granted, everyone has different feedback. 3 - most of the curators are not musicians or producers themselves. This on the outset is what we musicians want anyway - for a natural audience to hear our music and judge it, with unbiased ears. However, when such a lamen is paid to give a two-line piece of feedback, it becomes an unnatural and pointless exercise - like a bricklayer giving their paid-for feedback on the Mona Lisa and focussing on a moot point of the song. This wouldn't be a problem if the bricklayer had a huge audience to share their opinion to, but most of the curators all have no audience (we're talking Spotify playlists, bandcamps, small indie radios, blogspot style blogs"". 4- you can see how much of your song they listened to. Some listen for 1 minute and will tell you the song lacked structure, drive, power or whatever word they decide to use. Seriously. In short, it's a quick and fun way to get your song 20 or so listens for $20. But don't expect to get any meaningful feedback. The listeners are not experts. They are not established musicians. They are most likely people wanting to earn a quick buck and spend a minute deciding the song isn't for them. Because it isn't pop or hip hop. I've had some songs ""curated"" on the platform from some curators that really enjoyed my stuff. But don't get excited. Some blogspot blogger isn't going to get you famous. This is all it is. An armchair enthusiast looking to make a quick buck. You're far better off promoting your music and building your fanbase. Your art is unique to you and some will like your music and others will not.

""the song is too guitar based""""the song is too edgy""etc. so if you're reading this and write music that falls into prog (or anything other than pop or mainstream), then you know that such comments come from someone who does not listen to alternative music, and you will suffer this same problem. a look at the top performing tracks shows a preference for hip hop and cheese pop. this is fine, but the website pushes the ability to share your track with other genres, and those curators that capture your attention falsely label their interest, imo. the issue i think, as an artist submitting music on submithub, is multiple1 - the curators are not explicit enough with their labeling in preferred genre. or, if they are, they are completely wrong and uneducated about it. which is a whole other problem. and shows more about the type of people that sign up as a curator. 2 - curators are clearly not music experts. they will cite non-existent production problems. and in every one of these cases, they cite erroneous feedback about production issues that relate not to technical production/mixing, but personal preference to the song or choice of instrument, out of context with the song and irrelevant to the production, and every time you'll have feedback from some other curator on the site suggesting the opposite. ""vox too quiet / vox too loud / guitar unecesary / needs more guitar / mix too obvious / production too safe / muddy mix / etc"".  granted, everyone has different feedback. 3 - most of the curators are not musicians or producers themselves. this on the outset is what we musicians want anyway - for a natural audience to hear our music and judge it, with unbiased ears. however, when such a lamen is paid to give a two-line piece of feedback, it becomes an unnatural and pointless exercise - like a bricklayer giving their paid-for feedback on the mona lisa and focussing on a moot point of the song. this wouldn't be a problem if the bricklayer had a huge audience to share their opinion to, but most of the curators all have no audience (we're talking spotify playlists, bandcamps, small indie radios, blogspot style blogs"". 4- you can see how much of your song they listened to. some listen for 1 minute and will tell you the song lacked structure, drive, power or whatever word they decide to use. seriously. in short, it's a quick and fun way to get your song 20 or so listens for $20. but don't expect to get any meaningful feedback. the listeners are not experts. they are not established musicians. they are most likely people wanting to earn a quick buck and spend a minute deciding the song isn't for them. because it isn't pop or hip hop. i've had some songs ""curated"" on the platform from some curators that really enjoyed my stuff. but don't get excited. some blogspot blogger isn't going to get you famous. this is all it is. an armchair enthusiast looking to make a quick buck. you're far better off promoting your music and building your fanbase. your art is unique to you and some will like your music and others will not. but the judgers on submithub are nowhere near arbiters of artistic truth.  save your money."

63e811f29b64b1bdaf548711,4,big fan of submit hub,"big fan of submit hub. i run a small label which is basically a second job on topof my time consuming full time job and submit hub makes it easy and convenient for me to give exposure to my artists, without having to cold call hundreds of reviewers and playlisters. i mostly use the submit to curators, submit to influencers, and hot or not features the most. Hot or Not is a great feature that allows artists to artists review and exposure. i love that people using it have the option of adding songs they like into spotify, which results in some genuine fans even though the impact is small. i think also the 6 credits for 50 plays is the best deal on the site. part of me wonders if plays from this feature get counted towards a play on spotify. i don’t think it does but it could be cool if it did. feed back can range, from positive to negative, authentic or phoned in, but it’s nice to be able to see the persons average score given, as well as their most recent reviews. i use the data collected through the genre ratings to figure out which genres to pitch to when it comes to curators, which i think helps to get the most bang for my buck. pitching to curators is also really great. i think i might get better results if i wrote each curator individually but i don’t have time or patience for it. i think for at least the genres i frequent in, which is generally not commercially oriented, the playlists and reviews can be smaller. i think cumulatively they add up to higher buzz and play count but i’m not getting thousands of plays on my best playlists or anything (maybe once i did). the playlists do help to algorithmically set genre specifications for the songs and i notice they will sometimes get picked up in an algorithmic playlist here and there, again nothing big, but i think most frequently on artist radios (where spotify plays auto generated playlists based on the album, artist, or song). I also use another site similar to submithub, where you only pay if you get accepted into playlists. i think that’s a pretty cool feature that i wish submithub at least partially adapted. i do feel like there should be more regulation on the curators in what they can charge based on what they provide. i’m happy to drop 3 credits blindly to a top playlister (say for example BIRP), knowing that in the chance they dig the track, i’ll get hundreds of plays. however there are some that are 3 credits and the playlists are like <5 listeners a month and i’m like why? i personally feel like if a reviewer or playlister doesn’t have an audience, or maybe they’re growing the playlist that applies to my genre, i should only have to pay if accepted. otherwise, i’m happy with my experience using this feature, and most of my artists clock more monthly listeners and have more exposure than most of their contemporaries of a similar tier, save for the ones on bigger labels then mine. ok the influencer submission is definitely the place where it could use the most work, which is understandable being it’s the newest feature. i will say it has improved greatly since starting, and it’s nice that you only pay if you get accepted. however, my biggest qualm lies with the quality of influencers. while their are a few cool ones here and there, by a large measure, most of the content shared with my songs are things that i’d be embarrassed to share. while it’s cool to get thousands of plays on a tiktok or ig reel with my song on it, it sorta doesn’t matter if the content is lame. while it’s true that having your song connected with influencers is a great way to make younger audiences, the coolest influencers large or small are simply not on submithub. if you had the time to do thoughtful content searching on you own to find creators actually making culture on these apps you’d be better off sliding into their DMs for a collab. they might charge a lot but at least it would be good content shown to people who actually might be interested in your music and people who see their content and be inspired to use your sound. as i said before, my focus as a label is not on commercially produced music so maybe others leaning into that might have a better experience. it’s just, i don’t want to see a get ready with me video featuring my song when the person making the video has zero rizz and no style and looks like they shop on asos and at target. not to be harsh but that makes my song look less cool. i think submithub to fix this could do more outreach and try to get cooler content creators on this site. aside from that, many creators have your song pulled way to the background with talking or sounds going over the vid, which again leaves the focus in the wrong place (sheer plays over genuine fans + and other creators using your sound). the youtube gamer boys are even worse, no gamer is looking up my song after playing COD, i’m sorry. i genuinely do like Submithub though! thanks",2023-02-12T00:08:50.000Z,"February 11, 2023",jb,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/63e811f29b64b1bdaf548711,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63e811d9e5f4470014b45e97,big fan of submit hub,big fan of submit hub,"big fan of submit hub. i run a small label which is basically a second job on topof my time consuming full time job and submit hub makes it easy and convenient for me to give exposure to my artists, without having to cold call hundreds of reviewers and playlisters. i mostly use the submit to curators, submit to influencers, and hot or not features the most.

At least, that is my experience.","one of the (very!) few real, trustworthy services out there. i have an experience with them as an artist as well as a curator, and of course, i can compare with other services out there. you need to be ready for rejection, especially if you don't give your time into the research and send it to all or to your rough guesses. many curators are picky, or their playlists niche or something specific-oriented. however, many playlisters are kind and thorough, and you get, often, real feedback and/or a feature. you don't pay for the feature, but for the review, the feedback, curators' time, so that should be your mindset. and with a good song and the right targeting, you can actually get playlisted.one important thing i love about it - the in-depth information you can get when truly digging in - about the curator/playlister, the playlist/website/youtube channel, their taste, and many other info about them (so if you're looking for in-depth feedback and they are labeled as ""people often rate their feedback below average"", you know it's not your guy - or gal).you can also rate the curator and their feedback, and so if someone was rude, you can rate them as such. and whoever thinks a poorly made, poorly produced, low quality song will be liked anywhere enough to truly playlist and give it hundreds of listeners should try to make their own playlist and promote it and see how well it ""works"". you do want your song to be pleasing the listener, or he will simply click on ""next"" - which is why curators very rarely go for low quality tracks.it is good to try other services, and you will come back to sh if you want to submit the right way and actually have a clue where, why, whom you're submitting. at least, that is my experience."

63d046484b01fb3f548bed44,4,My experience with Submithub,"I am singer/songwriter/musician and I am new here on Submithub, using services only for 3-4 weeks. The website is designed professionally, the navigation is easy. Support works efficiently and gives you feedback with the speed of light. I would like to thank Jason who provides me feedback in a competent way. I see advantages as well as disadvantages being in musicians' community here. First of all, I am glad to meet my colleagues from all over the world. Some reviewers provide you very detailed, exact information on the songs or compositions and are pretty much fair, but there are reviewers who can write you only one word ""bad"" and give you 1 point without explanation and that does not conform Submithub policy. I always try to provide other musicians detailed feedback and support them and motivate. As music community we need to be united and make this world to be the better place to live in. The drawback which I have noticed is that when you send your song to the curators they can reject it without any explanation. I've sent a song (Electro Pop / Deep House genre) which was recorded, mixed and mastered in professional studio and it was rejected by three curators of four without explanation, without even listening to those 30 seconds (I've sent it and few minutes later got a letter that song was rejected. I thought probably bot replied to me such quickly:)). I guess it could happen because I did not buy the credits and used standard plan or premium credits rewarded to me for my feedback to other artists. I suggest in such cases the Submithub team to work closer to curators and explain more the policy of a feedback to musicians. Because with such point of view of curators to their colleagues artists, your services could start to lose clients. I know well that music is very subjective matter and sometimes really good songs are out of playlists and vice versa in a playlist you can find really bad track, but it is probably the matter of taste of a curator who manages this playlist.

FIX IT.","if i could give it a negative review based on the bs response from my first comment i would. majority on the platform don’t upload songs from submithub. it doesn’t add up when they have a 2% acceptance rate yet they are uploading everyday. if you look at artists that are uploaded it’s either a huge artist or someone who has a whole damn team behind them with a huge budget. it’s all a money grab for these curators. and when you do get on a playlist or something i bet you get less than 100 streams and no new fans. people build up their bs channels to appeal to the eye just so they can get paid and recoup the money they spent that built up their bs playlist. the youtubers on here are way too picky. i have a guy whose worked with 50 cent, lady gaga, ne-yo, swedish house mafia and many more giving me insight on my mixes and doing my masters and yet timmy whose never made a song critics it like he’s won a grammy. submithub will say don’t trust people that guarantee streams which is true, but when this is for indie artists to combat that and it’s literally impossible to get placed on anything…when you have no connects and you’re trying to do it legitimately  what are indie artists supposed to do then? hope the company crashes and burns in the next 5 years. friends of mine who have managers, play live shows, and have released on labels say how crap submithub is. there should be a minimum of a 35% acceptance rate for all curators of every platform if they want to stay getting paid by submithub because this is ridiculous. they already have the mindset of denying a song when they have less than 10% acceptance rate so that alone shows you they are in it for the money and don’t care to discover new music. fix it."

6323aaa87f7a8621ee5cefb0,1,The trouble with SubmitHub..,"The trouble with SubmitHub... where to begin. The owner, Jason Grishkoff, takes advantage of artists by allowing their money to be wasted on curators who do not give the artist proper feedback or even give the submitted song a chance, which is what you are paying for. Stay away from this place.In addition, Jason attempted to bribe users leaving these reviews here by presenting them with a coupon code on the site at the same time as asking for this review. That should be against policy on here and I am not impressed.Edit: After speaking to another SubmitHub user who has done well on the site, it turns out that the company has policies about removing curators who participate in ""payola"". However, a recent conversation in one of the chatrooms on SubmitHub between Jason and this user appears to have turned up that dozens upon dozens of curators are participants on a competitor's website that IS payola, but Jason isn't doing anything about it despite knowing that these curators are on both sites. This is particularly shady to me so I am staying away and I recommend you do the same.Edit: Spoke with yet ANOTHER popular user on the site, who tells me that SubmitHub keeps curators around who don't even respond to submissions - paid or free - for excessive amounts of time, wasting the time of artists. Another red flag.Here's the bottom line, guys. Step back and look at the bigger picture, from a curator standpoint. OK. You're a curator. You already have an established audience, and you already have channels or means by which you bring in new music to your Spotify playlist. There's no shortage of new music out there, ok.Along comes submithub. And suddenly you can get paid just for rejecting music that you don't even have to listen to - all you need to do is write some generalized response about it not fitting your playlist, and no one is going to call you on it and there will be no consequences. You really don't have to accept just about anything. Maybe a token song every now and then to give submitting artists hope. But you can mute playback and let the song run in the background and just put in your general rejection text variations while you do other things. Easy money.I'm not saying that all curators do this. But a large number of them do. Why? Because on SubmitHub, it's a greater incentive to REJECT the song than to ACCEPT it for a curator. ACCEPTING means the work of adding the song, taking a risk on a new artist with your audience, and all the danger and work those things entail. Whereas, REJECT the song and all you have to do is write a little original snippet of text about it not fitting the playlist, and you don't even have to listen to it - and you earn the money either way. Think about it, guys. This is ripe for exploitation by curators and SubmitHub doesn't do anything about it, they expect you to pay either way.

You really don't have to accept just about anything. Maybe a token song every now and then to give submitting artists hope. But you can mute playback and let the song run in the background and just put in your general rejection text variations while you do other things. Easy money.I'm not saying that all curators do this. But a large number of them do. Why? Because on SubmitHub, it's a greater incentive to REJECT the song than to ACCEPT it for a curator. ACCEPTING means the work of adding the song, taking a risk on a new artist with your audience, and all the danger and work those things entail. Whereas, REJECT the song and all you have to do is write a little original snippet of text about it not fitting the playlist, and you don't even have to listen to it - and you earn the money either way. Think about it, guys. This is ripe for exploitation by curators and SubmitHub doesn't do anything about it, they expect you to pay either way. And that's the underlying dishonesty here.","the trouble with submithub... where to begin. the owner, jason grishkoff, takes advantage of artists by allowing their money to be wasted on curators who do not give the artist proper feedback or even give the submitted song a chance, which is what you are paying for. stay away from this place.in addition, jason attempted to bribe users leaving these reviews here by presenting them with a coupon code on the site at the same time as asking for this review. that should be against policy on here and i am not impressed.edit after speaking to another submithub user who has done well on the site, it turns out that the company has policies about removing curators who participate in ""payola"". however, a recent conversation in one of the chatrooms on submithub between jason and this user appears to have turned up that dozens upon dozens of curators are participants on a competitor's website that is payola, but jason isn't doing anything about it despite knowing that these curators are on both sites. this is particularly shady to me so i am staying away and i recommend you do the same.edit spoke with yet another popular user on the site, who tells me that submithub keeps curators around who don't even respond to submissions - paid or free - for excessive amounts of time, wasting the time of artists. another red flag.here's the bottom line, guys. step back and look at the bigger picture, from a curator standpoint. ok. you're a curator. you already have an established audience, and you already have channels or means by which you bring in new music to your spotify playlist. there's no shortage of new music out there, ok.along comes submithub. and suddenly you can get paid just for rejecting music that you don't even have to listen to - all you need to do is write some generalized response about it not fitting your playlist, and no one is going to call you on it and there will be no consequences. you really don't have to accept just about anything. maybe a token song every now and then to give submitting artists hope. but you can mute playback and let the song run in the background and just put in your general rejection text variations while you do other things. easy money.i'm not saying that all curators do this. but a large number of them do. why? because on submithub, it's a greater incentive to reject the song than to accept it for a curator. accepting means the work of adding the song, taking a risk on a new artist with your audience, and all the danger and work those things entail. whereas, reject the song and all you have to do is write a little original snippet of text about it not fitting the playlist, and you don't even have to listen to it - and you earn the money either way. think about it, guys. this is ripe for exploitation by curators and submithub doesn't do anything about it, they expect you to pay either way. and that's the underlying dishonesty here."

And I personally checked the frequencies and the peaks, the loudness level and all, and it's perfectly where it should be. Loud enough to be played in clubs but not too much to lose dynamics and create problems with Spotify (that re-adjusts all tracks at -14db of LUFS). So, if you want to be played at festivals as well on digital streamings, but don't want to create a different master for every occasion (which is a possibility), the ""PERFECT MASTER"" should output at -2db of True Peak/RMS and -8db LUFS of loudness. That's it.Aside from that, my tracks are also optimized and checked in mono in the mixing phase, to be sure that at clubs still having mono systems, the track sounds exactly the same as in stereo.So, I guess, Submit hub, you have to review your music curators, cause they totally don't know what they are talking about, technically.

62ea34b98000af4a88530ea2,1,This website seems to be a sneaky scam…,"This website seems to be a sneaky scam that exploits artists who are desperately in need of attention. At first, I didn't really get the full idea of this platform so I decided to use it to get to know better. I've spent almost $20 to submit songs and at that point I thought you'll get your money back when the curators reject to playlist your song. However, only 1 of 9 people accepted my song and 8 denied with some stupid reasons. Plus, all my credits are gone! for whatever words they leave as a comment for the song. I get they have followers on their playlist but there's no one who can judge your music based on their personal taste. Also, the system of the platform itself is not quite reasonable for a powerful curator to list your song for only a couple dollars, I do not know however, how much they receive but it can't be much considering the platform itself takes most of the money as well? If they don't have to return your money back and still gets whatever points in their pockets leaving comments, of course anyone'd do that instead of listing them. It's a common sense and I don't get why people still spend their hard earn money on this website to get a couple comments? Also, the system itself is not built for the curators to leave good comments because if they do, they'll lose their reason to not list the songs. I mean, think of it this way. You're an influencer with 100k followers, would you list some random person's post only for a couple dollars? No! So they milk out the system of this platform because the platform allows them to earn money even if they reject as long as they leave a couple words about your music. That way, they exert their influence on small aspiring musicians who are desperate for the attention for the music that are made with their hard work and blood. It's not only about money. It's about legacy for all the great musicians out there because! they not only take your money but the system itself is cutting ego of the artists. I'll never ever use this terrible platform nor I'd recommend to others. It would have been a fair system if they had a policy where the curators has to return their money back if they reject the songs even if they don't have to leave a comment. Also the commenting system should be up to the artists by being an option for them to choose not the curators. If they come up with the system, I'll reconsider it but I strongly doubt that. Why? Because it's the key feature they can only make money from. If you know what I mean. If you have money to spend on this website, just run ads on FB or IG or anywhere that's relevant. You'll see more results overtime I promise.=======To add on the recent reply from the owner of the website.Based on what you just added to me it just sounds like a big excuse and you miss a lot of points I made. If it was literally just to help both sides curators and the musicians and ok let's say that they don't care about money. What's the whole point of your website charging musicians only then? Not the curators. Based on your statement, it should work equally for both side because if they really MEANT to find a good song, musicians are also helping them to provide their good music. Do you think you can really say that they only come up with a pure and innocent intentions under your policy? Why your policy doesn't provide an option for the artist to choose whether or not they'd rather receive a comment instead of refunds when denied by the curators? Why the musicians are the only one that has to pay and be glad with whatever outcome that'll come forth? Your statement would have made more sense if there was no money involved and your policy wasn't to credit those curators where they can milk the system or abuse it as you'd say. And since the whole point of your platform existing is for musicians to have a chance to be playlisted and you're denying the whole fact stating that it's against the Spotify policy just sounds like a big contradiction because you know that the only reason they pay is to get playlisted. And the reason you can't get rid of the system is because you know that they won't pay if it was only for a freaking comment in the end. It's just a big hypocrisy I feel even stronger after getting your reply here. Yeah, you can write it off as oh, it's just how it is and it's our nature or whatever.

If you are not careful, this can negatively affect your self-worth as an artist, if you do not understand it is pretty much all BS. It is not until I advanced significantly as an artist and started submitting work by proven world-class engineers, just to be told ""mastering could be better, etc"" that I realized it was all nonsense.

Went for a while, and artists were extremely happy with my work. Then one day - BAM - they blocked me saying my playlists were bringing in only a couple listeners a month. I provided evidence directly from Spotify data to contradict that, showing that in fact they were bringing in hundreds.

They wouldn't listen and kept defending their ranking/monitoring system which is obviously flawed, instead of working with me to find the problem on their end and fix it. So you could spend years building up your operation just to be blocked one day by a provable glitch on their end, and they won't listen and all your hard work will go bye bye.This is when I completely lost trust in the platform. My experience as an artist began to make sense - their monitoring simply doesn't work.Anyway, I give two stars instead of one because I met a few cool artists as a curator that I added to my playlists, and we built lasting friendships.

62c6ac01853b02c06c99f182,5,"Recommended, Authenthic, but keep your expectations real","First of all, I definitely recommend SubmitHub, it is the real deal (i.e. it is not a scam, will not try to steal your money, and actually delivers a service), but you have to keep your expectations realistic. If you think you will reach world wide fame through this service you are wrong. I give it 5/5 stars because I have not found a better service. I have tried Musosoup, but I do not like their model of having first to pay for a campaign and then having to pay again once a curator approves your submission (yes you can choose not to pay again but then you will not get any meaningful coverage). I have tried dailyplaylists.com which is free, but they will send a lot of SPAM to you email. SubmitHub will let you send your song to an outlet for 1-3 credits and then it is up to the outlet if they want to share it or not. They will however, give you feedback if you want them to and you choose who gets your submission. SubmitHub lets you send your songs to curators (i.e. bloggers and playlisters), Influencers (Instagram) and Labels. I have mainly used it for curators.  I have found SubmitHub to be very helpful in trying to figure out what kind of genre my very different songs belong to since I create very different songs.

In my opinion a seasoned musician knows to send music to a particular ""stated"" genre. They know to have a quality product, plus they have extensive training in instruments, theory, etc. Properly submitted music gets turned away with comments on how great the song is and then they choose one comment to turn it away. The comment generally shows they have very limited training in music. I'd rather someone say ""I don't like it"" than try to upstage the knowledge of the person submitting the music or use a formula to ""be positive"" and then ""pick any excuse, even if not applicable"" to get your money and not have to place it on a playlist. In reality they may have a playlist with mixed genres, maybe they just don't like the song, maybe their openings are full, or maybe they just want the money. As they aren't musically trained the one criticism is usually off. And, if you do get on a playlist when the genre is not understood (because just any playlist will accept you) it is worse for the artist's algorithm. I'm not saying all submitted music is awesome, but no one is helped by someone they are relying on giving them misinformation. Sure, say ""it's boring, no dynamics"" for an example, but know what dynamics are. Boring does equal no dynamics if you are in the business for several genres. Saying no dynamics when it is full of dynamics clearly reads your criticism as BS and what was the real reason? Saying a guitar vocal doesn't fit your ""indie"" or ""acoustic"" playlist?? Genre's are so general now that blaming the genre unless it's EDM vs Meditation and why someone would submit that?..clearly there is confusion. Why don't you tell them they should look at EDM because you are Meditation playlist or vice versa? Don't misunderstand. Artists I know get on playlists so this is not about ""not getting chosen"" it's about seeing turndowns of better music over less, comments not fitting, the obvious not talked about.. like my playlist was full. If it is their excuse they don't get paid so it has to be yours.

62035e58bc5a51af69bc8680,1,Submithub is a blatant scam run by grifters,"Started using Submithub starting in 2018. I started out submitting to blogs and music websites and realized it is a waste of money upon looking at the content of said blogs and websites. The ""curators"" on Submithub are not useful or genuine in regards to getting exposure for your music or the artists you are promoting. All of the websites are simple wix.com or tumblrs thrown together with the sole intention of milking Submithub's credit system. You won't find Pitchfork, Fader, or GorillavsBear-tier blogs on this site, simply put.As mentioned before in literally all the negative reviews on here, the playlisters on the site are Fiverr-tier click farm scammers. Again, don't expect any exposure from these playlisters unless you get satisfaction from bot accounts falsely inflating your statistics.Finally, the Hot or Not section. Similar to Soundcloud in getting ""feedback"" from other artists. However, the anonymous nature of the site has created a system that favors negativity. You also have to pay $$$$ for the feedback with time and real money. Just use Soundcloud (which is free) for peer feedback.My biggest issue with the site is the site-owner. He's an incredibly smug and defensive grifter who is taking advantage of artists who have no idea how to market their music. He takes advantage of record labels and promoters too broke or out of the know to put real effort into advertising their artists. In the music industry, it's all about ""who you know"" and  Public Relations (PR). Employing a respectable PR firm is the best way to market your music and artists. It costs lots of money but it is better than wasting your money on this shovel-selling scam site.Update 02/15/2022:Please be aware that the site owner is now inflating Submithub review scores on this website by inviting users to leave feedback with 4 or 5 stars.

In the murky world of playlisting and submissions, I honestly think Submithub is a shining light. It puts the submitter in full control of the submission process and seems to make a genuine effort to weed out bad playlist actors. It works for some genres better than others and as a label that specializes in more leftfield, alternative music I wish that area was a bit better covered with more curators, but essentially it's a microcosm of the music scene and niche is, well niche!. Saying that  I've had some notable successes as well and if you look at other PR options you can't argue with the  cost of submitting your music.Obviously you have to have a thick skin as you're going to get loads of feedback about your music, but I've found that most (sadly not all, but that's to be expected) playlisters are generally thoughful with their responses, even if they don't like your music and as a label or artist the sooner you get your head around subjectivity and learn to do your thing no matter what people say, the better your life will be.The platform is also continually adding new features with an emphasis on providing transparency and useability and when I've had cause to contact the site their responses have always been quick and helpful.The site is a bit daunting when you first start using it because if you dig a bit deeper there is a hell of a lot of information (so much more than other sites) on there to help submitters e.g. what a curator specializes in, their different playlists, how popular their playlists are, how many plays you can expect, the %chance of acceptance, really it goes on and on.

Look in the mirror for that.","i think a lot of the bad reviews are people that are sore that their songs aren't being shared. as with any music submission site, it's well known that the ratio of rejections is high. it's just part of the business. i have found success on many levels both small and large on submithub. i've worked very hard to submit to opportunities that were an actual good fit for my music, and when i get a response that isn't helpful or isn't professional i just hide that entity so i don't see them anymore. submithub is only as good as the curators, labels, and influencers that are on the site. but in my experience my rejections have been respectful if not helpful. and i've made some really good connections. there is a myth out there that everything is rejected, rejected, rejected. but the fact of the matter is, if you have good content and actually know how to market it then you will find some level of success on submithub. what the complainers should do, is collect the feedback they receiving, and actually use it to improve their work in the future. there are certainly some bad eggs out there that give lousy feedback, or that share you to super small playlists. the solution is simple, don't work with them anymore, leave them bad feedback, and report them if appropriate. make sure you pay attention to their ratings before you submit to them. it's pretty straight forward. submithub only connects you to opportunities, it doesn't write good material for you. look in the mirror for that."

60aff15ff9f4870a94af1744,2,SubmitHub is broken,"I think SubmitHub is broken. At least, it is for certain genres (probably most of them based on what I see). I’ve been using it consistently for 6 months, spent about $1,000 in total. I make Deep House / Progressive House music. It’s not a very obscure genre, my tracks aren’t experimental in the least bit. I’ve released 13 tracks for which I’ve used SubmitHub for each. While I won’t pretend like my music is always executed perfectly, most of my tracks are well done, especially my more recent ones. When submitting, I use Deep House and Progressive House as genre filters for curators. I’ve been submitting only curators which submit to Spotify. Somehow I can’t seem to get anyone to share my tracks. I get the odd comment that says I could have done better on this, or that, but the vast majority of them come back as one of two things:1) I like your track, it’s really well executed, but it doesn’t fit my playlist style, or;2) The track is well done, but the melody just didn’t catch me enough to put it in my playlist.There’s also the occasional “I really like your track, and although it doesn’t fit my main playlist, I have this new playlist with 7 followers that I’ll add you to”. I've seen a pattern developing this way. When you go into the curators main playlist, you see lots of followers, but then the tracks/songs are mostly from mainstream artists (who clearly didn't get on the list by way of SubmitHub). By putting you on a lesser playlist, which will never get any traffic, the curator's score for amount of shares will still go up, making it seem like they share to big playlists... I should say that I have approximately 50K views on YouTube for these same tracks, and 40K plays on Soundcloud, so there’s definitely an audience for it, who like my music, so I have to rule out the possibility that I’m not getting success with SubmitHub because I suck lol.That why the only conclusion I can really get to, is that:A – SubmitHub doesn’t have enough curators who cover playlists of enough genres. Even in Deep House, which is pretty mainstream right now, once you get past the first 5 or 6 biggest curators, the other curators down the list will only really expose you to 30-50 streams per playlist.orB – Most curators are now simply just taking submissions and declining them using the same reason, that your track doesn’t fit their style. It’s an easy excuse to use given curators need to have creative control over their lists, but it doesn’t help artists at all, nor will it help SubmitHub when artists, such as myself, decide to call it quits with the service, because of how stacked it is against you. To be fair to SH, I don’t think the problem is solely with their service. I think with so many new music producers out on the market nowadays due to the pandemic, they’re flooded with requests, and can only share a fraction of those on their playlist to avoid diluting it so much that it’s pointless. That’s why it seems to be a problem with more playlist pitching services now. You would just expect a bit more from SH because they seemed to have a good system once.For anyone reading this wondering what they should do instead, I would say focus on growing your followers, not your streams. Use social media, reach out to people who follow similar artists as you on IG and such. Avoid spending money on Spotify playlisting as well.

I found this bizarre considering how each of them ended their messages to me.They went on to either tell me that they didn't feature the genres that I had submitted to them, despite claiming so in their biogs or they would move the goal-posts and give me a very long winded, yet open ended, difficult to comprehend, magical mystery set of attributes that they are looking for when selecting music.In other words I was being fobbed off.Many of the curators responded to my submissions within just a few seconds which leads me to believe that they were replying to me with pre-written text just so they could get rid of me and clear their inbox.I also suspect some of these curators are using the SubmitHub platform to project an image of Elitism that enables them to shoot down quality artists that pay good money to send them music. No doubt this gives them a kick.There are better platforms out there.
