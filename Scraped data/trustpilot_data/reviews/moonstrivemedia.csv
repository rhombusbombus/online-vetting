650026675a11ee08bd70304c,moonstrivemedia,2023-09-17 21:47:05.000,"A little disappointed: I was a little disappointed in Moonstrive's performance, but perhaps this is just the nature of playlisting as a means of promotion. On the face of it, you could be mistaken for seeing their promise of placing you on playlists with 100,000 listeners in an overly optimistic light, and see their guarantee of 1000-15,000 streams and expect yourself to be coming towards the top of this rather wide minimum guarantee. In our 4 week placement we got 3300 streams from being placed on 4 playlists with a total of 141926 followers. These playlists gave us only 2.33% streams to listener ratio, so they're not super-active lists, although this is all within the lower end of what they promise to achieve on their site if you read the offer closely. I found that the largest playlist was the most disappointing, only 352 streams from a playlist with over 100,000 followers (that's 0.33% of followers listening, and without this list they would have fallen way below their 100,000 followers promise). The playlist itself was the Soundtrack for a computer game which was mostly composed by the band Daughter. I have to question whether this is a good playlist to place anyone on - if I'm listening to a soundtrack playlist I'm not going to be interested in songs that were not on that soundtrack.I guess this kind of placement, and looking at the artists on the other three lists, suggests Moonstrive weren't quite sure what to do with our genre. So these 3000 streams will come from a wide range of people, and be quite unlikely to gain us any further organic streams. We didn't grow our followers at all, and I ultimately regret using the service. Moonstrive imply that they're highly targeted for any genre and that they are likely to improve other stats because their playlists are not bots and 'help to trigger the Spotify algorithm'. This simply was not the case in my experience but it did teach me to avoid playlist promotions in future. Unless they are highly targeted to very genre specific lists with active listeners seeking new music it's all a bit pointless, unless you just want vanity streams to make your profile look good. If that's what you're after you could go much cheaper and get bot listeners from another service as it will do you just as much good (based on my experience and music in the indie rock/alternative genre).",3,Trustpilot,"{'ExperienceDate': 'September 12, 2023', 'AuthorName': 'Adam Kidd', 'AuthorCountry': 'GB', 'AuthorReviews': 7, 'ProfileLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/59c0fd010000ff000acaf0b4', 'ReviewLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/650026675a11ee08bd70304c'}"

Ended up on 4 playlists, each with a broad but still appropriate genre fit. Our song was a noisey alt rock / post punk song and was put on the playlists ""Biker Music Rock Songs,"" Notion Vibes,"" ""AC/DC - Best Rock Songs"" and ""American Pie Playlist."" I purchased the 100k Playlist Followers package, and after 4 weeks the song accumulated 1,789 streams from those 4 specific playlists, which is pretty solid for the price. There seemed to be a radio bump for the track during this time, but I've been using a few different promo services over the past month, so it's hard to tell if this bump was from the Moonstrive playlists or not - regardless, I am sure they helped! The team was also incredibly speedy, accepted our track and had us added to the playlists within 24 hours.

I'm new to this world of music promotion, so wanted to try small campaigns with several companies to see how it went. A couple companies didn't provide good results at all, a couple seemed to be using bots and another looked legit but only had streams in South America, which isn't my target audience. Going forward, I will mostly use social media for promotion, combining my posts with advertising, but will continue using Moonstrive to help my Spotify numbers grow and reach more people. I've gone from 0 streams, 0 followers to 140k streams and 400 followers in six months. At the end of the Moonstrive campaign, when my song is removed from playlists, the streams numbers drop significantly as you would expect, but I still see listens everyday that I believe come from listeners of the playlists I used to be on that saved my songs or added to their own playlists. I've used Moonstrive to find playlists for 3 songs and each experience was good. The playlists my songs were put on didn't seem the best to me at first (for example ""Rock and Roll Classics""), but the results are better then any other company and I'm confident the listeners are real (spent a lot of time looking at each playlist my songs were place on to see the history). It's hard to know for sure, but my Instagram followers have increased quite a bit too and I wonder if that is coming from folks that found me on a playlist.I've learned it's a bad idea to spend a whole promotion budget on a playlisting service, but it can help a bit and is worth it if you have the money to spend. I think of it as covert advertisement - my songs aren't advertisements per se, but when someone is listening to great songs and then my song is played, that is my chance to win over a fan. It's not going to happen every time of course, but my song wouldn't have reached the ears of that music fan at all if I hadn't done the promotion. One thing I don't love is that they are not based in the USA, so when I pay them my bank charges an International Service fee (1%). Maybe it's just my bank, I'm not sure...

Some playlists that they added my song on did not fit the genre but they were very communicative to help sort it out.They don't make big or false promises which is important for an indie artist but they do their best which to be honest I feel will only get better as they gain more playlists that fit a number of genres.I plan on using their service continuously and hopefully they continue to get better.",5,Trustpilot,"{'ExperienceDate': 'April 07, 2023', 'AuthorName': 'Lagentina', 'AuthorCountry': 'HK', 'AuthorReviews': 1, 'ProfileLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/642fdd4e2271270013cd03e0', 'ReviewLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/642fdd6f52d9a569207fb5e2'}"

You show these people getting streams but then when you look that profile on Spotify you only see 100 listeners from all those streams. Understanding that only 1% to 2% of people May return to listen to you again to your music but you make is seem that people will get famous overnight which to me is discouraging me from using you again. 5000 streams on YouTube May get me 30 likes which results in return listeners.  3000 streams in a month May get you 20-100 return listeners every so often. Honestly you spend more than you get for the long haul but advertising cost is about the same if not more which is exactly what you are. My main complaint is that I don’t think your playlist choices are always the best and honestly repetitive for songs that are totally different. I think you should allow the customer to choose the playlists that they think they would do best on. After all it is their song. Also it only helps a little to have people playing your songs in other countries as I can’t go and play for them. So maybe let people also choose where they want there songs to stream if that’s even possible. Understand I root for the underdog because I am one and you may crush more dreams than help if your advertising claims these “great” results. It takes more than a  1,000,000 dollars to make a person famous for a major label. Look it up. So a couple hundred or thousand will only take you so far.

63fbd1e6b44ecdb678e0d027,moonstrivemedia,2023-02-26 23:40:54.000,"Highly Recommended - An Excellent Tool for Growth: I am very satisfied with the service provided by Moonstrive Media. My band has promoted two songs with them and will soon be starting our third. Our music is mostly hard rock and blues and we are from the United States. The song we are currently promoting is getting 500-800 daily streams, dozens of independent playlist adds from other curators, and a handful of saves each day. Our Spotify page had about 60 followers starting out and now we have nearly 200 after promoting two songs. Some days we get a bunch of new followers, other days we don't get any. The best part of this experience is all of our older songs are getting streams too, meaning that these listeners are taking the time to dive into our older content (does that sound like something a bot would do?). The streams are coming in from over 90 countries and spread out pretty well among them. Our top performers are the United States and Germany. I have used one other playlist service before and pretty much all of the streams only came from one country, which wasn't really ideal. I find Moonstrive to be fairly priced and has changed our entire outlook on utilizing Spotify to promote our music. Our first song we promoted with them continues to still get a decent amount of daily streams, saves, and playlist adds even though the campaign ended two weeks ago. I think that the diversity in countries that the streams come from, the continuing success of songs even after your campaign ends, and our other songs getting streams because listeners are diving into our older content are what make Moonstrive so great and safe to use. The results we are getting are also translating into other areas of success as well. Since promoting these songs, we have had independent playlist curators reach out to us for interviews, blogs do write ups of our songs, and our social media following increases a bit each week. We also run Facebook ads for the first two weeks of a song coming out, but Moonstrive is the main promotion tool we use for the next few weeks. I would feel comfortable crediting Moonstrive for the results that we see on social media and in other areas. Think of this as an investment in not only streams, but overall growth that spreads across other areas where you might have a presence. I also really like that Moonstrive can get your campaign running quickly depending on if you get it to them early in the day on a business day. We released a song on a Friday, I submitted the song to Moonstrive early that morning and they had it playlisted by lunchtime. This is really helpful for making sure you have a good launch on release day. The only complaints I would have are very minor. I would like to see the amount of listeners that convert into followers be higher, but I also understand that this completely depends on how good your song is and that Moonstrive can't force anyone to do anything. They can only put the content in front of the potential audience and then it is up to that listener to decide if they are a fan or not. I think the playlists that our songs are placed on by Moonstrive make sense for the most part, but occasionally there can be an odd placement. For instance, our last song was more of a chill indie-pop song and it was placed on a Biker Music playlist. We have plenty of songs that bikers would like, it just wasn't that one. Still, we got great results and I can tell that the staff at Moonstrive actually listen to the song before deciding where to place it and they are accurate in their placements the majority of the time. I look forward to running many more campaigns with Moonstrive. Not only for our new music this year, but also our older songs that never really got any attention when they first came out. It's never too late to promote a song. At the end of the day, it all depends on the quality of your song, but Moonstrive is the most effective tool I've used to get that song in front of people who might become real fans. They do what they say they do, they get it playlisted quickly on release day, are fairly priced, and the song still gets some daily streams even after the promotion ends. Moonstrive is a solid investment and a permanent staple in our advertising strategy for the foreseeable future.",4,Trustpilot,"{'ExperienceDate': 'February 26, 2023', 'AuthorName': 'Riley', 'AuthorCountry': 'US', 'AuthorReviews': 1, 'ProfileLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63fbd1d1d3bd6f00120113c2', 'ReviewLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/63fbd1e6b44ecdb678e0d027'}"

Their service is fast and effective and they have been able to get the songs I have sent them placed on various curators' playlists appropriate to the genre of music. In a marketplace riddled with bot and click farm generated playlists all claiming to be ""organic"" Moonstrive Media appear to be the genuine thing in placing songs on playlists with actual real listeners. A check on Spotify for Artists shows listeners are spread over a wide selection of cities and areas as opposed to a few mid population towns while the playlist streams also seem to trigger the Spotify algorithm to generate more plays on Spotify Radio. The streams/ listener/ saves ratio also appears to be about right for real listeners. So if you want to go the way of playlist placements to promote your music I would recommend. Obviously streaming/listener numbers vary according to how people react to your songs but I have been happy with the responses I have got compared to other comparable services.",5,Trustpilot,"{'ExperienceDate': 'November 13, 2022', 'AuthorName': 'chris lewington', 'AuthorCountry': 'GB', 'AuthorReviews': 11, 'ProfileLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5bf68f2d5483f4b8a95761d2', 'ReviewLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/63713da0252cba2c02d7935c'}"

I have done more than 5 orders, which I would not have done if all was bad.Positives:- Some small playlists seems to be a very good performing. E.g. one classic rock 30k playlist was giving me the same number of steams as another 700k one I got a placement through a different promoter. After the tracks is dropped there were still plays from saves so the streams seems genuine.- Staff usually responds very quickly and willing to accommodate requests (until you post a non 5* review that is).Negatives:- There does not seems any classification of playlists by genre or mood. So my classic rock track almost ended up in a ""50 shades of grey"" playlist. I ended up going through all their playlists selecting the most appropriate ones, which is doing their job. By default most tracks tend to end up in an Asian OST playlist, which is not usually a suitable music genre. For promotion to have a long term effects, the track should be be pitched to a suitable genre playlist, not just any large playlist. So the company should try harder to identify the most suitable playlists. The need to approach them to switch playlists for more suitable ones is stressful and time consuming.- The 20% discount offered for an ""honest"" trustpilot review does not seem to apply to non-positive reviews like this. So the positive reviews written could be just to get the 20% discount.
