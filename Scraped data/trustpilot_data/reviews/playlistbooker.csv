It took a VERY long time, but got on the algorithmic playlists and the streams were steady. However, last week Spotify issued a strike on my account (through my distributor) and let me know these were bots and if I don't stop they will pull down all my music! Completely wasted my money and jeopardized everything I've been building on Spotify. It is not worth it, stay far away! I had wrongly assumed they would use Meta ads to trigger the algorithm playlists, but it sounds like they just use botted accounts to do it. The website promises they don't use bots and I foolishly trusted them. Lesson learned and at least Spotify didn't pull down my music and instead gave me a stern warning.",1,Trustpilot,"{'ExperienceDate': 'December 01, 2023', 'AuthorName': 'Tony Venuto', 'AuthorCountry': 'US', 'AuthorReviews': 2, 'ProfileLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64a87ca22188510012f61da4', 'ReviewLink': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6571e4f220d978adb231a0a9'}"
