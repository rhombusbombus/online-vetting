After that, it was an easy decision to subscribe. The content is great and informative. The strategies he suggests aren't always easy, but they are effective, which IMO is how you know it's legit! I've tried other music marketing courses, and they just weren't as good. I've been doing the DK-MBA courses for about 10 months, and it's really crazy to look at where I was then vs. now.

I actually joined Damian's academy on behalf of my daughter, Kallea, who is still young, so I run all her social media accounts etc. Having already released her debut single previously to joining DK-MBA and having paid £500+ for advertising (which I'm not sure was spent in the right places) I decided that joining the academy would help me learn what I needed to know so I could help her in her career going forwards.DK-MBA has so many useful courses, which you can go through at your own pace. These have taught me so much; from the best way to release music, to Facebook advertising, to understanding Spotify/playlisting, to live sessions run by Damian himself - there is just so much value given out by Damian and his team.There is a Facebook group full of other independent artists, where you can ask questions and people are also able to give advice on things that have worked for them. Damian is in the group himself and gives out personal feedback/advice there too.For far less than the cost of advertising her debut single, I've figured out how do run my own marketing campaigns and build momentum and excitement in releasing music.The release of Kallea's second single (after joining DK-MBA) went so much better than the first and I saved myself an absolute fortune, having learned all the tricks of the trade from Damian.

There isnt a single useless thing in there, plus he keeps on adding every single week and often multiple times a week via his private live sessions. He takes the time to answer you personally very often and I really feel like he care deeply about all artist careers, which is why he provides free information on youtube and insta also.
