I can proudly say once you invest at least 150$ in this app to get the free month plan, you are almost guaranteed to get more than a 1,000 plays on your songs through campaign. I know this because I've done this very specific thing and gotten 1,000 plus plays in one day with repost exchange by soundcloud. The best thing about it is, it's all real people on this app that actually engage in your songs. If your just making music, or want more plays repost exchange is one millionnnnn percent the way to go. I went from being someone who only got 100 plays on my song in a month (Max) to making at least 2,000 plays in 10 days! If that's not a sign to join repost exchange, idk what is.

63679f77b84cc27618e3a3e6,5,The most organic way to reach new audiences on the internet,"If you have come to realize how much good music is out there, you'll accept that it actually requires some effort to be seen. If you're rich, you can try to see if you can just buy the success and a have a good ROI.Of course the most organic way to reach new audiences is always to play your music in real life. If you want to hide in the studio a bit more, like me, the internet is an opportunity. Leaving aside the video platforms, where you can reach new audiences with great visuals, repostexchange is the most and only organic platform that I know, to help you reach new audiences.They basically enable you to tap into the audience of other artists, by making them repost/comment/like your work for credits, which you can earn by reposting/commenting others. Or, if you're impatient, lazy or want some more fire, you can buy credits.But what I love most about it, is that it actually also works without being money involved in every step. It comes very close to simply connecting with other artists and helping each other on the way.They have a very good and sharp system to detect fake followers (trust me, I had to feel it, when I bought some followers from some scammer site, that where sold as organic ones — don't do it, you'll get banned from reposting immediately!)Of course, such a great software takes resources to run, maintain and develop, so it makes sense for them to offer some well priced plans that give you some advantages. And they really do. It's not just the usual ""we limit the full range of features so that you can basically not really use our platform without paying"", but it's rather that you get better exposure over others, which is kind of fair. And you can also buy followers there actually, which are.. well as organic as it can get, when you buy followers. But I guess half of them won't follow you because they genuinly like you music, though. (You'll see why)The best way to gain new followers is to just ask for reposts directly from other members and accept repost requests. Naturally creators looking for someone to repost, will check out what you create to see if your audience might fit, and some will follow you. And of course, if someone reposts your music because they genuinly like it, they will in many cases also give you a follow to hear more.  That's what I mean by organic. If you have an artist plan (few bucks per month), everybody who reposts your track, will also be asked to follow you on other platforms like Spotify, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.The power of the platform is, that it gives you one practical, very simple to use interface to do all that. So it takes down the barriers of effort to do all that. Imagine you would have to write people an email, ask for reposts, comments, etc.. This would take so much more time.",2022-11-06T13:50:16.000Z,"November 06, 2022",Sven Sebastian Horner,3,DE,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/63679f77b84cc27618e3a3e6,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63679a7e7c8e03001325402c

62f9e23c4c35e69ec52d22f5,4,"The idea is an excellent service, couple of flaws though","The idea is a good one, get musicians and composers from around the world to upload their tracks onto SoundCloud and from there, RepostExchange can make things happen for you in several ways.The first thing to know is that it takes time to listen to other people's tracks and decide if you like them or not. If you do, you repost them and earn some credit, with which you can fund your own exposure campaigns. It also permits you to hear what level your own music is at in terms of professional composition and production, and often can begin conversations with other artists. It's all quite modulable so that you can focus on music types that resonate with yours, through RepostExchange and SoundCloud, and this is the best bit in my opinion, you can write directly to the page owner/musician/producer. I have found that there are people out there that are willing to communicate and even participate in various projects. So that, is very cool. RepostExchange gets my music out there and heard by other musicians. There is also the 'fast' way to do things, and this is the commercial aspect of RepostExchange, you can pay to get your track promoted by their service, to get heard more, to gain more followers. However, I am finding that this service has a few flaws and tends to bring in followers who were just after extra credits rather than being generally interested. As per usual, short cuts are not always best. But using Repost in connection with SoundCloud is a way to get music heard by musicians and other industry bods, and that is invaluable.",2022-08-15T08:05:48.000Z,"August 15, 2022",Mr Mathias Laubli,10,CH,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62f9e23c4c35e69ec52d22f5,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5416b13f00006400018a872a

Too much take and you likely wont see the results you want.Edit: You may end up with a high number of reposts compared to likes. This is because users are rewarded for reposts. So naturally there are users who will only repost without following, liking or commenting. If you go to the RepostExchange front page, you can see the number of reposts, likes and comments generated through their service. Reposts at the time of checking is about double the number of follows and likes combined. This in turn makes it easy to spot users of the service while browsing tracks on Soundcloud. Repost exchange users will generally have 3 characteristics to their tracks: A high number of reposts, zero one-word or emoji only comments and the people who are commenting also come from RPE so they are other artists, not fans.

6276aa7e166eb7ecbf400fac,5,EXPENSIVE BUT VALUABLE!,"I really like this platform for SoundCloud! It's a bit pricey but REAL people get to listen to your music. They might not always give you ""positive"" comments but they do comment & repost your music! So if your content is good & worthy of listening to then you'll receive lots of positive comments like I have experienced. You have to download their app & buy ""credits"". These credits range from $20-$120. You also can become a monthly member for even extra money which adds additional advantages. There's different levels of memberships. I've actually joined the ""Promoter"" one which costs like $100 a month! However with that highest level they give you free ""boosts"" to boost your music campaigns & free credits too! The way it works is you have to have a SoundCloud account & music on Soundcloud. You'll then run ""campaigns"" which other users will vote on your music & repost it or comment. The other users get credits to interact with you. So you're actually interacting with REAL PEOPLE & this service is 100% ORGANIC! You're not going to end up with 50k-100k SoundCloud streams from running one or two or even three $100 campaigns. The most I've been able to build a song up with just using this platform so far is around 20k organic SoundCloud streams. This costed me like $200 to do! So if you have the extra money & SoundCloud is important to you then I would suggest to try this service out. But again it's not cheap. In my opinion it's worth the interaction & feedback you'll get for your music. Now of course you could spend way less than me & for like $20 you get some reposts & comments on your work. But if you're trying to really push yourself out there then it's like anything else you'll need to invest some serious cashflow 💸 💰  Will you ever see that return of investment? Probably not especially off of SoundCloud.

60b63c77f9f4870a94b2dfcf,5,Really good promotional tool,"My Soundcloud page (SSMusic) has grown a fair amount since using this service. It can be costly to buy points to promote your music, or you can grind and earn points through reposting and commenting on other users music, I choose to share others music if it interests me and pay out for the points. Regardless how you go about it, what you get from this site is genuine artists like yourself promoting each others music and it is awesome! Not like some dodgey sites that get paid for them to use bots (which is total dis-honesty).I only have a couple of little gripes. First being that it can be costly to use the service if you are on a free account, this being because advanced options are hidden behind a monthly subscription (on top of money paid for points), without those options your points can drop rapidly by users with huge followers costing loads of points, but with a sad fact they spam repost so you don`t get exposure through them due to how much reposting they do. Pay the subscription to be able to set filters, trust me it will save you money in the long run!Secondly, you earn points from reposting, commenting and following other artists, this is fine, but unless you have a huge following on Soundcloud, you don`t get much. You will need to purchase points if you promote your music fairly often. I have found that I get requests from some artists which is fine, strangely though some of the tracks are awful yet somehow have thousands of views, yet some seriously great tracks struggle. This however can`t be a fault of Repostexchange though and thankfully you can choose what you repost and what you don`t.Overall I am happy I found this site and hope to keep using it for some time, just please keep the prices fair.",2021-06-01T13:56:07.000Z,"June 01, 2021",SimpleSimon,5,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60b63c77f9f4870a94b2dfcf,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5528152a0000ff0001b77caa

6071a89ef85d750870542f4f,5,Unique service with great impact,"I always reject requests from SoundCloud promotors who offer paid promotion. Playlist curators don’t like profiles with fake likes, comments and followers so they are most likely to ignore you of your profile looks fake. Repost exchange is the only promotion service exception i could find. The followers, likes and comments are real!  If yo put a little time into listening to other people’s music you can grow your profile really fast and get a lot of shares and feedback on your music. After engaging with Repost Exchange for a while my most recent tracks really came alive and there is a lot of traffic going on on my account now as of before there wasn’t really happening much. It is a good and fun way to interact with fellow producers and to get your music under the attention of labels and promotors. As a producer in these modern times you have to do a lot of disciplines alone so it is important to get feedback on your productions and Repost Exchange also provides in that.

606f173af85d750870500e98,5,"Gain traction, gain friends","Hi world.I'm Evan from Rock Island. soundcloud/rockisland580I didn't start using RepostExchange until November 2020.I've been on SoundCloud since 2018. In the year 2018, I received a total of 319 plays. In 2019, I received a total of 3,300. A substantial increase that was driven by my YouTube channel. 3,300 total plays though is nothing to hang one's hat on. In 2020, I received a total of 29,878. What's incredible to me is that I gained most of these plays in the month of December. Every month prior to November, I never made it above 200 plays per month. I found RE at the tail end of November, 2020. 11/20 I received 2,197 plays 12/20 I received 11,007 playsWhat an incredible feeling it's been to promote my songs and receive real plays back. And so many!RepostExchange is a service where artists exchange their music with other artists. The music is exchanged with each artists followers. Artists create campaigns for their song using a ticket system. When another artists chooses to repost the song being campaigned, they receive tickets for doing so. These other artists can then use the tickets they've received for reposting to build their own campaigns. It's a really neat cycle. My opinion on RepostExchange is that it is the coolest music promotion tool I've found. It can be done entirely for free or you can do a monthly subscription. The paid plans have their benefits - the level that one would subscribe to is dependent on how serious one wants to take promoting their music (or potentially someone else's). I do the Network Plan so I can promote 3 songs at once and use the 'Featured' tool.The things that Repost lacks are few for me. I think the biggest thing I've realized about it is that you are mostly sharing music with other artists, and there are a lot of artists. But there are always more listeners than artists, and RE can be difficult to reach the actual audience of listeners. This is somewhat offset by the Repost Charts, but the Charts are not so prominent on SoundCloud's total website. I would definitely recommend RepostExchange to artists who are looking to grow their following and gain some feedback on their mixes or songs. I've networked with some other artists too to gain feedback, play xbox, and discuss music as well. It's definitely worth trying out!",2021-04-08T14:46:18.000Z,"April 08, 2021",Evan of Rock Island,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/606f173af85d750870500e98,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/606f172cc61786001b81f433
6032bf58f85d750b989c5657,3,It's a 3.5/5 for me.,"It's a 3.5/5 for me.Not a bad website overall, but there needs to be updates regarding the procedure.You can't 100% know if people took their time to doing any of this and oftentimes the comments just seem fake (obviously the person is real, but they don't write meaningful comments, so maybe you should be allowed to accept a comment or reject it)The rating after hearing the song makes little sense as well because you'll have people repost your tracks and then give you a 5/10 rating.. like? not very encouraging or genuine, I'd much rather have the rating system before so you can have a general overview of this from people who also chose NOT to repost your music.Great website. Great idea. A little outdated and left behind in terms of giving a real natural interaction between artists. They're mostly just grinding their points for their own promotion.EDIT: Thank you for clarifying!
