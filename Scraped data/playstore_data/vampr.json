{"Content":{"0":"Hopefully 1 day!!!","1":"Perfect way to build your band","2":"No musicians in my area, only ads to pay to go pro. Also, you sharing my info, I've had 4 spam calls today alone.","3":"Conected with over 20 artist and collaborated \ud83e\udd70","4":"Perfect way to connect.","5":"The app is decent, for the most part it seems to be a place for artist to get their feet wet and find potential like minded people to collaborate with and show off a bit of their skills.","6":"Nice","7":"This is my favourite app by far, I've met so many amazing people to work with and jam with, friends in new cities who share a love for music, and new people to enjoy each other's music.It would get 5 stars if it weren't for the glitches but I still love it","8":"Nice for connecting with other artists","9":"Super!","10":"So far it's not asking to pay to message other musicians like some platforms.","11":"Incredibly buggy","12":"A very useful app to build a community","13":"Good app \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe","14":"Really cool app that does what it says on the tin. Have had a few matches already.","15":"My Day 1's!","16":"I haven't really used the app much yet, but from what I can tell, it seems pretty easy to navigate.","17":"Update it again! Great app, but it crashes a lot. Fix ASAP.","18":"while i do love the idea of the app, it can be quite frustrating when its filled with bugs, glitches. having to constantly restart the app sometimes does negate the overall experience. if the team can really trim the fat and improve these things, i would recommend it a lot more.","19":"Had a bad experience, can't complete the profile set up. It keeps telling me to open settings so that I can add a profile picture but it wont tell me which setting to open. Very disappointed, I wanted to use this app but it won't let me.","20":"I don't get proper notifications so I miss messages or connections, it's a good idea, but could be a lot better.","21":"So beautiful for every musician to have.","22":"Still seems early in its early stages.","23":"Nice","24":"It's a good app but it has its limitations","25":"great app to find good musicians","26":"\u0130t's hard to swipe left and location doesn't want to change","27":"just untrust worthy scammers only full of wimps spamming production. no professionalism or even scouting. really? no one is looking for a thing. its boring a waste of time really mobile apps are embarrassing Whats the obsession with Canada? i get way too many connection profiles there. Americans arent the music center internationally? Well they are yet none to be found lol. i think the paywall date tactics are an obvios sign something isnt right about the authenticity here. bye die hang or fall","28":"Meh...","29":"Fab","30":"As a developer I'll give you an advice: DO NOT FORCE the customer TO UPDATE the app without a previous warning. I entered on the app for an urgent matter and it didnt give me an option but to update it to continue using it. It is fine, but you have to send a warning in the previous use \"you need to update this app otherwise NEXT TIME it wont work\". Why? It sent me to the Play Store, nothing loaded, I tried to update it several times only to load forever. Third party bugs, yes, but caused by that","31":"I'm pretty impressed by how much is in this app. People sharing their content. Connecting with other musicians. Local talent just being a click away. Definitely the best app I've seen like this.","32":"Something is up with messaging","33":"The tinder setup and having to decide yes or no immediately just doesn't make sense at all when trying to find musicians.","34":"SoundCloud login does not work on Android","35":"Love the idea","36":"Downloaded the app, set up a profile and already managed to meet someone willing to jam. It's simple to use and enlightening how easy it is to find other musicians. Great app!","37":"Not much activity on here Gonna keep trying Thank you","38":"Amazing app. Love it.","39":"Won't let me post videos (vamps) very irritating \ud83d\udeae","40":"Meeting musicians is hard, this makes it easy.","41":"Seems ok but not enough people on it","42":"It's very nice and easy to collaborate with people.","43":"Cool concept and really helpful for indie music producers","44":"Great for communicating with artists","45":"The social musical connection aspect of this app is awesome, but the application itself has bugs. Specifically issues with file sharing, within personal messaging and occasional moments of instability while uploading\/editing info and general exploration of the user interface.","46":"Buggy, you have to do 10x the work to set up your profile and engage compared to most modern apps, but get about 1\/10th the results because finding musical collabs is hard and rare. The impending redesign better be simple and focus on minimizing the amount of taps and content uploads to get started. Devs: Just ask for a photo, target genre(s), a bio, a piece of audio \/ video content from each user and make considering others an autoplay \/ one-swipe experience. Ditch \"cards\/full profile\" split\ud83d\udc4e","47":"The app is straight broken it doesn't load past the opening page","48":"It's ok I just have to add more stuff to my profile","49":"So far so good","50":"The app was okay, but now the free version is pretty much an advertisement for the paid services most people don't really need.","51":"Resourceful app. Great for meeting artists around the world. Although there's no way to send images in conversations. This needs to be fixed","52":"Costumava funcionar, agora s\u00f3 carrega. Tentei reinstalar e agora sequer loga.","53":"The app feels poorly optimized. I am on a Samsung S23, and this app causes my phone to stutter. Also, urls often don't work when adding media to your profile, and the app gets stuck when trying to upload a video for a vamp.","54":"Set up a profile. It seems to know my location, but doesn't obey distance filters for finding connections. Also, after presenting a picture of a possible connection, it won't let me swipe left to ignore it. So I'm completely stuck. Uninstalling.","55":"App freezes on step 5 of 9 (selecting genres).","56":"Excellent platform to connect with artists and fans, my first single released already has 9,000 views. I'm excited to watch it grow with Vampr","57":"Only one notification type means you can't find tune notifications to get what you actually want at all. Also it does that thing where it sends you an email and says hey you've got a message and then makes you redownload the app to view it and respond.","58":"Great App!","59":"Would be quite useful for mus8cians in the future.","60":"This really helps me","61":"I'm new to all of this,older gal. It seems like musicians are quite happy and this app was recommended to me by multiple ppl.","62":"We need more interactions between real musicians.... Vampr fils this gap.","63":"ITS NOT LETTING ME POST A VAMP, IT FREEZES EVERYTIME I TRY, REGUARDLESS OF HOW SMALL THE FILE SIZE IS!!!! FIX ASAP","64":"Slow","65":"Musician Tinder. Its pretty sweet!","66":"Worst app ever You are wicked You just wasted my data","67":"Good, so far.","68":"Some glitchy but the app is being updated overtime, hope developers are working on issues","69":"It's cool and easy to use \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd","70":"Great connection app for artist and producers alike. Friendly and complimentary to those who really love their art form.","71":"Although I haven't had a successful jam session set up through this service yet, I still appreciate this app. Tend to miss receiving messages though. Maybe a \"messenger style\" update would make short work of that? Floating chat bubbles couldn't hurt! \ud83e\udd37 Or may e floating chat.... bass clefs! \ud83e\udd23 I am humourous.","72":"WARNING! SPAM AND MAYBE MALWARE! When I installed this the app also installed 5 game apps that I didn't authorize. In addition the app is not free as advertised. You can browse only and not contact anyone without paying.","73":"Great app to meet and work with different people around the world.","74":"Fun app","75":"Please developers look into this. I have to login again and again to check my notifications Every time I check or view my profile Vampire needs email id Afterwards it will show my credentials and notifications","76":"Awesome concept for a music related app. Used to be an awesome space to check out folks for collabs and ger some $$$. I just made plans to move my EP to Vampr distribution and my future releases, and app no longer works??? This is so frustrating. Fix this guys and ger the 5 stars you deserve.","77":"It's a rlly good app to connect with fellow music lovers, tho after the latest update the app stays stuck on the loading screen for me idk why","78":"Can't even open the app","79":"Awesome","80":"App is useless. Stays on the loading screen and never gets to the UI. It worked before. Not certain if it's an update that broke it but aside from that the UI is abysmal. A tinder tinged musician finding app that is at best a cute copy of tinder and at worst a limited, frustrating, cash grab for vampr pro. Endless notifications even after you've dismissed connections and constant requests to get your music mixed by people that have no shared interests. A great idea but poor in execution.","81":"I'm using a Redmi note 12 pro, system up to date but still the app just doesn't open, no matter how long I wait. T.T","82":"I can't get it to work. Just stays on the logo screen.","83":"This app doesn't work at all - it's just stucking on the logo picture. (I've already tried to open it with both VPN turned off\/on","84":"Good","85":"The whole system is predominantly based around \"vamps.\" Yet the upload system of vamps is terrible. When a video doesn't meet the right filmed characteristics such as it's frame, vampr doesn't have a system to correct the parameters to fit and transpose the video to the app software, nor does it detail why the video won't upload, it simply buffers and then does nothing.","86":"This app is terrible","87":"Great app, would be cool if you can add more genres (Shoegaze please!) + the free swipe limit is a little restrictive it should only count on right swipes like dating apps","88":"This app has honestly been very helpful for me. The ways of finding musicians is constantly changing and Vampr does a great job of extending their feelers for other like minded individuals. Thank you Vampr!","89":"Keeps having a problem opening app","90":"Man this app sucks, honestly you'd have more luck trying to find musicians on grindr. And it's clunky af plus theres the ridiculous restrictions imposed through not paying for premium. Save yourselves the effort cause it ain't worth it.","91":"Would've been great but it wouldn't upload my photo at all or let me skip the step to try later. No way of uploading it another way.","92":"it's not a terrible app but it's a little clunky and really vacant of players unless your in a big city. I had zero luck in and around Tulsa.","93":"Works well so far","94":"some bugs but overall a very good app for networking with audio\/visual artists and professionals. I love this app","95":"I have made many connections on here. Just what I was looking for.","96":"Meh the musicians on here are trash","97":"Networking Gold!","98":"Nice app","99":"For the past years the app has gradually become more & more buggy. Works... maybe 1 out of 4 times. Pages regularly don't load, & pop ups never cease... I've kept using it because the IDEA is great, being able to chat to artists around the world has been very revealing of the artist mindset. But I wouldn't recommend using this app to meet any serious bandmates. \ud83d\ude05 (although I've heard of it happening once or twice)","100":"Awesome app, having moved to a new country and looking to meet people got new projects it opens up lots of options. \ud83e\udd1f","101":"Dead Profiles Glitchy Interface Connecting is hard as sometimes messages don't load up","102":"Amazing concept","103":"I really like this app","104":"Excellent","105":"Yeah needs more musicians \u2076r","106":"Terrible app, it takes forever to load anything you click on, that makes it impossible to use it. The community is great so it's a pity you can't access the content. I desperately looked for a way to open it from the browser but this option doesn't exist. It's the app or nothing. So uninstalled it. Useless","107":"Good for finding musicians in or close to my area.","108":"Adorei. Facil de achar parceiros.","109":"It's good but it would be nice if it allowed you to upload your songs directly to it rather than just linking to a url.","110":"It's decent!","111":"great for artists and all creators","112":"Women BEWARE. This app forces you to use location and will display your exact city publicly on your profile !! This is a real safety issue, especially for women!! I got stalked by a creep who found my city on it \ud83d\ude33 it's a tiny place and he actually found me !! To those who created it, are you out of your mind ????","113":"Dope","114":"Best way to expand.","115":"Very great! Good for connecting with people","116":"The bad: This app feels like using a beta or even alpha release. I know SW development is not cheap and simple, but you gotta fix the voice messages issues. I aborted three msgs to a user then recorded a new one and sent it.. he recieved the 4 msgs concatenated into one. That was embarrasing for me. The good: I'm discovering the music scene in my city and it's pretty much livelier than I expected and might actually be heading towards making some cool music projects thanks to this app \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9a","117":"Good so far","118":"Excellent","119":"Really great app but very bad performance. Flutter is betten than React Native.","120":"Very good, Have met some wonderful singer through this app.","121":"Very cool place to meet people who doing music) very happy that I found it","122":"Just started using it more but a great place to network.","123":"Works well, like tinder for people trying to play music together \ud83e\udd18","124":"Great overall idea, but swiping?! \ud83d\ude48 Come on!","125":"Swiping is impossible.","126":"nice","127":"Needs more people","128":"Needs to adapt UI to Android Display settings. Just ignores them.","129":"inconvenient interface, too large search radius (25 km minimum)","130":"New","131":"Amazing app","132":"Great way to find more musicians to jam & collaborate with!","133":"Nice social network for musicians, djs and producers. Easy to use with a wide community active.","134":"Great for finding and talking to potential band members","135":"Really good and useful but very broken","136":"Idk yet","137":"I like the layout and hope it gets as big as LinkedIn, still trying to find my purple \u2714\ufe0f","138":"Waste of time the app is unusable without paying...","139":"I pay for this service, and it limits me to sending 100 connection requests a day. ...why?!? Unsubscribing until connection limit is removed.","140":"Best app to find bandmates and friends too","141":"I complained about the app sending me only connections from other countries. The staff here actually listened, they fixed the algorithm and apologized. I'm happy to announce I've found my new keyboard player thanks to this app. The interface is well built, it's nice to look at. This app can be a bit buggy, but it doesn't seem to affect usability. I want to thank the staff for their customer support which was outstanding.","142":"I actually reall like this app, it's really good for connecting with likeminded artists and composers. The one thing I don't like about this app is the limited amount of swipes you can have. While I understand they have to make their money somehow, it feels unnecessary and restricting.","143":"I love the concept and usefulness it provides in trying to connect musicians. However, the app itself is sometimes disastrous when it comes to lag and connectivity issues .","144":"Can't choose ska as a genre, so it's useless to me UPDATE: IN 2018, I made a note about there not being enough genres, and they told me that in the near future, you can add your own. It's 2023. I downloaded it, looking for a vocalist for my band, and it still is unchanged.also, my email was never answered. Deleting again. Won't return. Can't believe I'm forced to give the single star. That's not thier fault tho.","145":"Not bad ....I hate I have to pay though","146":"Works pretty well. The filters are also good. The UI lags a lot, and there are quite a lot of bugs. But I will let it slide for the functionality. As of now it gets stuck at random white pages a lot. I hope for improvements in further updates","147":"Its pretty cool","148":"Super app","149":"This is a great way to connect with local musicians! The more people that join, the better it will become.","150":"If you wanna meet bandmates and not get ripped off...","151":"I just signed up and after playing around with the app realized it's probably decent for original bands, but since I'm a cover band artist it's pretty useless.","152":"Tinder for musicians. Nice to have something to link with musicians with","153":"has a very small swipe limit. most of the people on the app haven't posted anything for years and probably don't even have it installed anymore. sends you notifications for things you can't access without giving them money. the audio\/video playback feature doesn't work half the time, and the app crashes frequently. it's also very slow and has countless UX issues. even if it had an active userbase, using this app is a test of your patience.","154":"It's good!","155":"It seems to work well","156":"So pretty good channel for upcoming artist and can monetize your brand","157":"App is buggy. Trying to ignore in incoming connection request and the app just spins and spins.","158":"It's very easy to edit your profile. That's a huge plus. It also customizes nicely \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd","159":"Wouldn't let me in the app","160":"Uganda feel the vibe","161":"Weird","162":"I can see others are complaining about the app but this works perfectly for me so far (maybe as my phone is a relatively new s22+) It's cool, works as advertised, and is a pretty neat way of connecting with other artists. Certainly makes you feel like a community is at your doorstep!","163":"Fun app with lots of people and musicians","164":"The app has great potential but it's super slow.a lot of bugs.fix those issues.this app can be the center of all upcoming artists","165":"The best app to have if you LOVE watching loading screens!","166":"Amazing App Nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d","167":"L'inetrface pourrait \u00eatre mieux mais c'est pratique pour trouver des musiciens","168":"Great experience","169":"Dope I'm making a lot of connections! @Imxrtal13 Everywhere!","170":"Brilliant app! Connected me (from South Africa) with work in USA, Sweden and UK. Love it","171":"Great app","172":"Why am I forced to go thru a tutorial everytime I open the app?","173":"est\u00e1 buena pero anda muy trabada sin razon","174":"Great app","175":"Decent app. Sometimes doesn't work quite as well as I'd like, and it sends a lot of notifications for things I could care less about, but it's a solid networking tool for musicians!","176":"Great social app for musicians! I've met some great and talented people all over the world","177":"App doesn't function. No matter how I adjusted the search preferences, I would only get profiles from NYC, which is states away from where I'm located and is not what I set my preferences too. I reached out to the support team, they said they fixed the issue, but I still ran into the same problem. I would not recommend this app.","178":"The app is great. But it crashes before I can even do anything and it doesn't stop crashing? Please fix this somehow","179":"There's no reason for a musician network app to look and feel like Tinder. If I'm not looking for a bassist right now, then I have to pass on them. Now I can't see their profile anymore. What happens if I need a bassist later?","180":"Great!","181":"Bug in latest version: The screen goes blank when view any profile.","182":"the cache is inflated and even the message cannot be sent SO TINY FONT - total eye test!!!","183":"Genius idea","184":"Absolutely phenomenal app! Well done to the creators!","185":"Good stuff","186":"This app is a great way to meet people and connect with musicians, but it's so poorly coded that I can't recommend it. This app is by far the laggiest one I have ever installed.","187":"Good concept but the app is very primitive and needs a lot of improvements like a loooot. Also the app is super slow and has a lot of bugs. I like it but it's a disappointment that it's still not improvement after all these updates...","188":"Great concept and very useful, decent execution, unintuitive UI, and generally confusing to use.","189":"It's super rare you will actually find people to actually collaborate together or help each other out with music","190":"Helpful application for musicians to connect with other musicians throughout the world. Very easy to find projects and collaborations.","191":"I believe the app is not that bad as some people describe. I believe Zuckereas will try to destroy everything he can't buy or he already bought. Rip WhatsApp, language change with no notification, rip Facebook, account removal because you are Russian. Marked heart - Watch on Netflix!","192":"It's vampr and what a app","193":"\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udfe1\ud83d\udfe2","194":"Good","195":"Doesn't work if you choose approximate location in the settings, something it is legally required to.","196":"Absolutely piece of trash app, don't waste your time","197":"Great concept made a few connects a few months back but now I have no idea how to upload or post. I'm basically stuck on the \"discover\" screen.","198":"It's fun looking at all them folks. I even jammed with some","199":"Great app. It has alot of room for improvement for sure. Socializing for musician in the traditional way will be gone pretty soon. This app will be big.","200":"To complicated","201":"Great platform for meeting up and coming creatives","202":"Good","203":"The idea behind the app is good, but pretty much everything about the app sucks. It won't let you post any video or audio clips, the marketing sucks, so hardly anybody even uses it, the notification system doesn't function well and I'll get notifications hours later than it was sent. Overall this app is pretty useless, even Bumble might be better even though it's not geared towards musicians.","204":"It's a good app but very slow and lag alot when in use notification are not visible even the notification is on.","205":"Great for finding new and hidden talent.","206":"Don't download this app. Look at the rest of the reviews and the responses. All the responses ask to send screenshot video of photos and to explain in detail what's happening, then say they've released updates that fix the bugs. The app is worse than ever. They have also added a new onboarding without telling anyone, so there's no sign in page, and when you select manual entry other than Facebook it takes you to a page that asks you to start entering your details again. Really bad. Avoid","207":"No users","208":"Great, place to connect with people, with the same interest for music. I recommend it!!!!! Download and share, this app","209":"Oklaa not bad","210":"You get to meet a lot of people","211":"My uploaded soundloud audio tracks keep getting deleted. I'm not even gonna bother now \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","212":"Cool","213":"Vamps are so broken, only accepts a few formats, uploading a video it just loops with a spinner and doesn't let you continue all options are gray.","214":"\ud83c\udd97\ud83d\udcaf","215":"Great app for getting connected with other creators locally and internationally, if you are starting from zero then this app will enable you to get started creating a network of like minded artists and producers. Ofcourse you need to have a active profile with examples of your work for the best results. It's a powerful app if used to It's potential.","216":"I can't upload my video or audio! Please fix the app!","217":"Dear #1 music networking platform, why i am not able signup with email??","218":"Great","219":"Verry usable app good for artist","220":"Great app for connecting and learning...","221":"A great and very helpful platform for beginers.\u2764\ufe0f","222":"App dont want to open","223":"Nice app","224":"Awesome","225":"Very cool site in my opinion.","226":"The app features is ok but it's too slow on my phone","227":"Productive. As a broke guitarist, This app has helped me jam with new people so I have no complaints.","228":"Good for collaboration","229":"0 out of 10 time wasting","230":"Good but can be added with more classic features","231":"Needs a desktop experience. Text can be quite small","232":"Honestly great app which would be much better if there were more people on it so just get it if youre interested","233":"No success yet, but I like the app","234":"App was great early on, there is definitely a problem with the most recent updates, lots of crashing, or straight crashing your phones UI only after the update. Otherwise the app is so so, would be better if it had more traffic. Sometimes the app makes partial suggestions that aren't close. Would be nice if there was an ability to select primary search to secondary search in separated categories. Has pros and cons, but even at an average rating, I would still recommend it to people.","235":"What type of UI is this? Pathetic. Hire good devs and design team. You are loosing users just because of this. Couldn't use app for few mins. \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79","236":"Good","237":"Made a profile and can't upload videos or even audio. I just get a spinning circle and a vamp uploading notification and it endlessly spins. The video is properly under 1min long and still. I don't understand why and it's something I'm giving up on When it comes to the UI the app is a bit cluttered and claustrophobic. It's not Smoove and doesn't really make it fun. So not the best experience unfortunately. This made me excited because it brings the musicians together locally. Update 6.26","238":"Muy buena app pero siento que debe de ser mejor optimizada.","239":"The future of music social media","240":"To few likes daily, but the concept is great","241":"this is really a good app to connect with others \ud83d\udc4f","242":"Vampr is awesome but please sometimes it take time to open can you please improve on that... thank you am smulee by the way \ud83d\ude02","243":"So far it's great!","244":"The app is great but the people on it don't use it properly. Maybe it's this new generation but either way, the app itself is amazing","245":"Yall had a great idea bit unfortunately with poor execution.but i believe it will improve.","246":"Some of the people i work with till this very day i connected with on this app","247":"Great app!! Led me to my current band and couldn't be happier! Had an issue with the chat, send along some troubleshooting, and it was fixed immediately!","248":"From 1 star to 3 \ud83e\udd14 Cancelled trial subscription due to app not working. Developer reported that app maintenance was being performed which caused my issue. I'm giving it another shot. Will upgrade after 3 months.","249":"I'm sorry guys, but your app doesn't work right at all. Deletes everything I put up, and it's covered in pop ups telling me to upgrade. I'm not going to pay for a service that doesn't work. I really love the idea though. I hope it works in the future.","250":"It's a good idea but the apps hasany bugs. For example I can't change my profile pictures because when I change them, when I restar the app they are the same as before, and also the app is very slow.","251":"Great way to meet new musicians to jam and collaborate with.","252":"Good app","253":"Man this APP LAG A LOT \ud83d\ude42","254":"Ok ok experience","255":"This totally great","256":"Nice social app. Connect to the world with vampr","257":"Works good","258":"Very useful networking app. You get a lot for free, and I like how flexible the filters are and the overall community of the website.","259":"I'm really disappointed with this app. It has a lot of potential, but it's horrendously optimized and the searching features are far from desirable. I hope they can add more talent to their development team because they desperately need it.","260":"Awesome experience","261":"Alerts are kinda spammy. Some functionality does not work","262":"It's super cool for finding people with similar interests around you. It's has really nice intuitive guides on how to put yourself out there the best you can as well, id say its worth it tbh","263":"Unusable on Android. Filling out any text : profile, messages, writing a hello freezes the app within 2 lines of typing. Browsing profiles causes the app to hang. Great idea but poor execution. No web interface to bypass the app problems. I want to bookmark a talent and not connect.

Very slow with loading anything.Good concept but not so great execution. Those 2 stars are for creating the niche for artists","271":"This is a great app, especially if you're looking for other musicians to jam with. There are a few things that would make it better for the overall user experience. There is not enough characters to right the feedback in this review but if someone at Vampr wants to have a conversation about this is be happy to discuss in further detail.","272":"Very good solution to collaborate witb people and build your portfolio, work together and succeed","273":"Amazing app, I've met lots of great musicians here and had business deals through this app. This is an amazing app for musicians, networking is really made easy here","274":"Was able to connect with afrobeats lovers","275":"Works good for free.

Because of that I don't mind.","281":"to the devs: fix the edit profile function when uploading pictures. We should be able to adjust and zoom in\/out of our photos before posting. Otherwise this app was a long time coming. Its amazing nobody thought of making this app sooner. Glad it's finally here.

Worth to try. But VERY VERY BUGGY. Unfortunately.","313":"Originally gave it 3 stars, but the app glitches, constant spam, and UI just make it not even worth downloading.","314":"My experience was very good so far. I wanted to keep my location anonymous, so they provided and changed it for me. The only thing is, there are not many genres, you have to make custom ones, and you can't search for custom genres. Examples are Phonk, Lo-Fi, Hardstyle... Also the app loading everytime you exit is a bit annoying.","315":"Naeen","316":"I can't upload my songs am a producer and singer","317":"Eaasssy","318":"After it has clear my data, still it did not work, telling me to try again","319":"It's useful","320":"Good interface, running smoothly but they should increase the number of swiping per day for the free user.","321":"Purchased a one-year pro membership in June. The other day I logged in to write a post on Vampr to advertise my services, only to find out that they had removed the 'social' and 'feed' functions entirely, rendering posting\/seeing other peoples posts impossible. All they want to do is shill their trash 'education' courses now apparently (which cost additional money). I am left feeling thoroughly disgusted by the app. Please just don't download it.","322":"It's pretty good","323":"So this app Was doing great. I found this really nice professional Phillipino kid who will move here to America to be in a band with me next year. However the app got totally stuck on stupid and froze on me while I was talking to him!!! What am I supposed to do about this, uninstall and re install?!!! This kid's depending on me to get him a job here!!! Luckily it worked enough for me to get his email address and an email from him. This sucks a lot Dude!!!!!","324":"Doesn't even load, goes back to blank login screen after I put in FB details,","325":"This app needs a more powerful search engine to be useful.","326":"Maybe I just haven't figured out how to use it yet but I can't seem to change what Instagram profile I want to connect my Vampr too. Once I put in my username for my main account, it links to my personal account instead of letting me go to Instagram to switch to my music account. It also doesn't match me with any local musicians. It keeps hooking me up with either people from out of state or other countries overseas..","327":"The app no function well","328":"\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01","329":"Great connections with fellow musicians","330":"I ll try","331":"Really am loving this, it's such a fun thrill.

ME! OUT! the blocking option doesn't work: the people you block are still able to text you and I've tried reporting and blocking a lot of times. The reporting option should have a section where I describe the problem. No matter what this guy doesn't stop harassing me. Please, do something.","343":"It was best app. Now it has become extremely slow. I feel like I'm using a dialup connection on windows 98! All the updates have made it extremely slow and unresponsive. It was better a few months back. What has gone wrong? Downdate the version to 2 months back. It was much better back then! And please do it soon or you lose users.","344":"Helpful","345":"Love the app. It's a great idea. But there are two issues that really bring down the app. When I upload a video to my profile the app completely crashes, and when I'm in the messenger it's incredibly slow that it makes it hard to send one message.","346":"Pretty cool app. Main gripe i have tho. You ask me for my favorite bands, so why dont i have a filter option to have people with similar Musical interests than me? Thatd be super helpful!","347":"Concept is genius. App glitches way too much, can't upload audio without crashing. And everytime I try to swipe left on someone it won't let me through until I swipe right","348":"Won't load past the fore logo.","349":"Scammers on the app","350":"ola tinder de m\u00fasicos de m","351":"The idea of musicians connecting is awesome! This app is not a good one for that. The font size for this app is horrible. You will struggle to read some basic things. Certain sections of this app I had to take screenshots to zoom in. You should never struggle to read things like age preference. Be careful using this app you may strain your eyes.","352":"Fun and new experience \ud83d\ude01","353":"Good","354":"I'm really enjoying connecting with other musicians","355":"Its an good app. I found my band here. Too many bugs that have to bee fixed.","356":"It's a nice app .I got connected with some friends.","357":"Pretty good met my current guitar player with it and chatted with some other people nice experience overall","358":"Horrible platform for musicians. It's like Tinder but for musicians. Accidentally skip over someone? Too bad. Get ready to pay real $$$ just to contact that person. This is a total waste of time and a slap in the face of musicians. You're better off looking on Craigslist.","359":"Very productive, inspiring and amazing","360":"Good","361":"Hii everyone I,m Here","362":"Cool app.","363":"Joyunl m","364":"Keeps crashing every time I try to upload a track.","365":"Good app initially but just doesn't seem to work anymore. I try to start up the app and it brings you to a loading screen with the logo and doesn't open, left it on in the background for 5 mins and it still didn't open. On the off chance that the app does start, it doesn't show the pictures on people's profiles half of the time.","366":"Nice","367":"Great App love it\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25","368":"Not bad so far","369":"Dope app for music distribution and many features, i barely remember all sorts of things that i can do with vampr. Im so pleased to have it as a distributor.","370":"Glitchy, always freezing and lagging :(","371":"I do like the app, but I wish you guys made a desktop version!","372":"The idea of the app is good however there is an extremely annoying aspect of the UX: when you are in a profile and want to minimise the app to get info from YouTube, Instagram, your emails, notes, etc, every time you come back to the app, IT RESTARTS, whereas it should keep state!! Finally, please follow another monetary model. It is stupid that you have a limit of profile reviews and that you cannot navigate a list of people you have dismissed to undo at will. You lose users because of it.","373":"Bug bugs and bugs","374":"Worked fine initially and I was able to view and swipe people near me. Only got 30 swipes per day without pro, which is not a lot but the developer needs to make money somehow. The reason for one start though is because as soon as I got a match I was completely unable to message with them. Every message I tried to send would fail and then if I hit retry enough times the app would just crash.","375":"Is Good to meet people that has good ideas and dreams for the music..thanks to vampr for creating this app","376":"I can't open the app. I have deleted it and redownload but it still doesn't work, i could only make my account but not use it.","377":"Its a really nice app for meeting people of same music goals","378":"Nice","379":"Non-user friendly. Can't upload any videos or audio to profile for some reason!

I will not advice you to download...... For singers only\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01","388":"Type font too small to read. Should allow more than a few swipes before asking for money. Most musicians aren't loaded with cash.","389":"My network","390":"You'll never love this app. If you don't have credit or debit card. What you wants you have to pay. If they free some things. They'll be like Facebook","391":"This was a long awaited need for independent artist","392":"Unable to send any messages","393":"Worst app","394":"Amazing.... Just Amazing\ud83d\udc9e","395":"Could not download it, I have tried downloading it like 7 times","396":"It's awesome","397":"Beautiful","398":"Slow , unresponsive app. Uninteresting and has limited options too.","399":"A little clunky but overall works great at introducing musicians to other musicians. Makes for a great Craigslist Musicians alternative. Edit: months later and this app is even more polished. I would definitely recommend this app if you're looking to meet musicians. Edit: 4 to 5 stars. Nothing clunky about this app anymore and I hope it continues to grow in popularity. I've already been able to meet multiple musicians through it.","400":"It's a mixed bag. Found a few quality contacts. The app is mostly the spam from soundcloud without the benefit of being able to post a lot of tracks. It has its place IMO but I'm not feeling it. Edit: Ended up deleting my account. The ratio of musicians looking to collaborate vs \"artists\" who are really just posting photos for likes and not producing music is not in favor of collaboration.","401":"This app is great and so helpful easy to use","402":"So great.","403":"A little slow to start off, but definitely some solid connections to be made on here if you remember to check your inbox after a few days","404":"Lots of bug after update my connection and chats and notifications are cleared now I have 0 followers and following, congratulations","405":"Can't find any interesting musical souls here!!!!","406":"Glad I joined. Within first month ive made music buds for life. Excited for the future","407":"Great!","408":"I LOVE this app. They have updated it soo well and made it a huge foundation for the networking I've had for my music. This really is the app to use when you want to have meaningful connections in the music field.","409":"Perfect","410":"Good","411":"Ossmm","412":"Just a rip off of tinder but the UI style doesn't suit the function. In fact its irritating immediately","413":"Unable to respond to any message, it is lost when I hit send button, it's been a week now","414":"I've been using this app for a long time and it's recently become completely unusable. My messages are not getting sent at all. If I exit the chat the message I just sent completely disappears. And more importantly the app doesn't even recognise when I open the chat, so my notifications show that I have multiple unread messages even when I've read them. There is something very wrong with the messaging system. I can see that others have this issue too so it's definitely not a problem on my end.","415":"It really a nice app where you can meet a lot of upcoming artist","416":"Its a good platform to connect with other artists","417":"Good lovely","418":"Messages send recieve bug is there.. i get a notification of new message but in app there is nothing..","419":"Good experience so far. The app runs well and got to connect with number of people. Based on other reviews I think they've made alot of improvements. Keep it up!","420":"Excellent","421":"This app is great","422":"Good method of meeting musicians","423":"It's just dumb. Old profiles. No one's serious.","424":"Keep Looking for people till the infinity.. taking too long? Yes.. Longer than anybody's life on this planet","425":"Limited usefulness. Can only choose a state as the location rather than a zip code. That's way too big of a search area. Only get 30 does per day with the free version. That's way too limiting to get a good idea of what's available, especially when you have and entire state as the search area. Probably going to delete this app and stick to using BandMix.","426":"Nice app for artists","427":"Wow, what a complete waste of time. It made me go through the whole creating of the profile just to at the very END reveal that they require all these insane permissions such as location and access to your YouTube account (including having the power to post publicly on your behalf!!!) in order to be able to use the app. And based on the other reviews, it certainly doesn't sound like it'll even be worth it (not to mention incredibly invasive).","428":"Very good","429":"Its like tinder but for musicians. Needs some improvements but in general very nice app! I recomend","430":"This appointment is fairly new so you people that are so critical you should give it some time you think Rome was built in a day ,for me it works great but then again I'm not that savy with technology","431":"Takes too long to open and keeps hanging . Not an user friendly app The issue still continues even after update !! Too many bugs in your app !!","432":"Has small glitches here and there. There's clear polish to be made, but the concept is perfect. I've made many connections now that I moved city. 100% recommend the app.","433":"Thanks vampr","434":"\"Send a demo file that you have stored on your phone or in the cloud\" Now that's what I was talking about.. Right now updating.. Will check in a while.. Peace bro!","435":"It's networking capabilities are dope AF! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfff","436":"Love it","437":"It seems good so far but a bit biggy for me. I'm sure it'll be fixed in time","438":"I think the idea is nice. But it's such a terrible implementation. The UI is terrible. I need to sooo many clicks to send a request. Half my messages don't get sent after matching. If you press back while a message is still being sent the message is lost.","439":"It has a great future's and has connected with other musician's in the world. It's a great app","440":"Oookkk","441":"Amazing experience","442":"It's a good app it does exactly what you expect it to the only problem is not enough people use it so it's hard to find people you can actually meet..it's hard but not impossible","443":"Wants to take control and manage my YouTube channel that's worth more than the app \ud83d\ude02 ill uninstall and remove from every where","444":"Cool gig","445":"This app has the worst interface I've ever seen. It recommended I finish my profile but when I try it just reloads the app to its default open screen. Keep trying to upload a picture. It gets as far as letting me pick a photo from my files, then I am back to scrolling through others profiles and it doesn't upload the pic. Trying to update or complete your profile in anyway like adding your socials or connecting to your insta feed or soundcloud has the same problem. Great idea poor execution","446":"Great","447":"Super cool","448":"Dreadful.","449":"Love it!! \u2764\ufe0f","450":"Absolutely pointless. The search filters don't allow you to exclude people that you aren't looking for and it doesn't adhere to the distance filter either, so you wind up wasting all your swipes. Also, why tf is it a swipe system to begin with?","451":"Great idea. But bulky, crashes a lot, small fonts, messaging is lagging ....","452":"Great app....","453":"I love the vampr app","454":"Nice App","455":"It's very useful app...i met new people, new talent and various artists...who wanna work together...Thanks...","456":"It's been a while I've been using this app and really sad to say it still has a ton of bugs. It's unresponsive half the time. I can't even see the messages I send. I think this app has been around quite a while to still have all these bugs and issues. Pathetic!","457":"It might be a good app but it's too dimly lit and I m not changing my display settings b\/c all my other apps are fine. Smh.","458":"Am unable to send message.","459":"Came to connect and find people to jam with; leaving frustrated and disappointed. Can't upload music or videos straight from your device or computer, and even if you could it costs money to do so. If you have an endless amount of cash, go for it. But if you don't, don't even bother with this app. Good luck connecting without any music to show off your talent. Only reason it gets 2 stars is because its a great concept and has a lot to offer - as long as you have money to burn.","460":"Can't log in \"Critical error\" when logging in now. Became a paperweight of an app.","461":"App is not opening stuck on log in screen...","462":"Nice app","463":"Is it available for indonesia? Its freeze on the first page.

Not a promising start. (I still haven't managed to sign up, so I give up)","473":"I can't even login to even give a decent review.","474":"Doesn't work. Screen fades out like your phone has low battery. Try to create account, entered email, no code received. How is this app in the Google system? Using S10+ Android, it's not old but not new either. Uninstalled.","475":"UI stuck at youtube login page","476":"Can't use Facebook integration and the app itself is hella buggy. Very hard to maneuver around. Wanna use the app as it's pretty popular, but I'm not sure how if it's this buggy.","477":"The Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn for all musicians and producer highly recommended to all musicians, Music lovers, producers, and people alike. You will find success in using this app. 10 \ud83c\udf1f easy.","478":"Very helpful for musicians and also learners.","479":"Probably a music rights scam! I saw an ad for this on facebook. Being a musician, I had hoped this might help me make connections. So I downloaded the app. Opened it soon after installing. And I can even make an account to log in! They advertise 50,000 song library... Whatever that means...so for a socal network that advertisies its song library, song rights scam!","480":"Great really helpful for connecting with other musicians","481":"Great idea great app","482":"This app is really cool for all the singers and producers but I am giving it only 4 because the app gets stuck a lot I hope you fix the problem","483":"Great App. Just needs to be marketed better.","484":"I love the diversity that hits you!!! I didn't even know that there were that many artists living nearby. I'm inspired all over again.","485":"Can't create account or log in without Facebook. No thanks.","486":"This app is stupid.... The app loged me out, when I try logging in back it tells me my account has been suspended ,even before I get a collaboration you all have to fix this app","487":"Best way to connect with Producers and Musicians","488":"The intention of the app is good. But i faced worst UX just using half an hour after installation. Too slow and shaky\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","489":"At least real People, Artist meet here, just that the a\"Big Shorts\" are maintaining there stance, somewhat aloof, no real connections. I think that defeats the purpose of this place, I thought here would have been the bridge we all is looking for.","490":"Seems cool so far and I have high hopes for meeting the future members of my band here. Longer Vamps would be nice, as I recorded one, but my guitar playing was cut off and it didn't record the last minute or so of my song.","491":"First time login process is too lengthy, registration process is too lengthy, those information should be after access the app. Not before that. I had to uninstall","492":"One major recurring UX problem has just not addressed. I've been using this app intermittently since 2017, being discoverable beyond the radius I'm searching within is bonkers. I get connection requests from 8,000 miles away for projects Im not interested in. EDIT: really don't appreciate the response from your team. When I'm ready to be discovered I'll put myself out there. I want to find local band members to make music with. Not Collab internationally.","493":"Nice app to connect musicians","494":"So far I'm enjoying it.

It was already bugging when I had to choose music genres and after uploading the profile pic it got completely stuck. So sad. I was really interested in the app. Update: works now, though the app seems a very slow at times. Please fix that!","501":"Paid for premium subscription, uploading tracks to streaming platforms is impossible cause you send stays forever in queues. App is exxagerated with funny paid content (like uploading pictures\/ tracks come on guys) not even viewed by others so growing on up is a lie!!! Also uploading your videos from YouTube channel is impossible cause app doesn't see the videos. \u00a360 for half year subscription? WASTE OF MONEY DONT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS APP, ITS A JOK3! HOPEFULLY EVERYONE SEE THIS","502":"Just another money grab app for people trying to find others with the same passion.","503":"This is good, buh I have to do more to get more out of the app... I Love it!\ud83c\udfaf","504":"I think is cool even though have not try it but to see good from this App","505":"Very very slow app ... And the limit to swipe is really stupid .We must pay to app to get the pro without knowing anything more about the app . The concept of the app is good but make the features in it just like the name .I was expecting very good but Iam really disappointed .","506":"Great app , everyone you meet in it is very supportive","507":"App is excellent for independent artists.","508":"Luv da idea and concept, except only the app couldn't last more than 10min, before crashing or freezing up. Please repair this bug I think this is such a wonderful new thing for artists were we can meet and collab.","509":"When I get to the \"favorite genre\" window I'm not shown any genres to select, so I just add them as custom genres, but then it doesn't let me proceed to the next window even though I have chosen 3 genres","510":"Lags alot","511":"Used to love this app and now it sucks cuz of limited swipes.","512":"User friendly highly recommend","513":"Awfully slow , please remove the hamburger menu ,it's annoying. At least give 5 swipe back for free!!","514":"This app is so lagged...\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27\ud83d\udc4e Almost killed my iphone \ud83e\udd27","515":"The name implies improv groove riffs","516":"Stuck loading on skill selection. Internet connection is fine","517":"Todo muy bien.. Pero de momento tiene algunos buggs","518":"Dope app and long overdue. Thanks.","519":"Great idea behind a poor app. Hopefully it'll become more stable with the upcoming updates.","520":"Great App","521":"Very good","522":"Amazing app \ud83d\udc4f","523":"The concept is pretty good and effective when it comes to connecting with other artists and industry people. But the apps got some flaws, which affect user's interest. This app needs to be more smooth in terms of processing the data and less bugs. Please improve it, otherwise it'll be very sad that this kinda good concept is getting wasting due to lack of quality.","524":"I don't normally review apps, but Vampr is just so buggy, slow and frustrating to use I had to leave this one star. I am moving overseas soon so upgraded to pro to begin making connections in the new city, but the city search filter just hangs so the upgrade was useless. Won't bother wasting my money with a paid account after the 7 day free trial.","525":"The user interface is good the app is user friendly and I'm already doing the needful with the app","526":"I'm just getting to know about the app I think it will be okay \ud83d\udc4d","527":"Really seems to not handle intermittent eifi disconnection... I am constantly trying to type to people and it just freezes... only way I can communicate is to type in another app, then copy paste into this one.","528":"Buggy","529":"Awesome app am enjoying it cus.am connected to many artist","530":"I log in the app... But it refuses to open in my phone... Just stick like image","531":"Good","532":"Nice one yall","533":"Great","534":"Great","535":"cant even enter it","536":"Awesome","537":"Great App","538":"Nice Design Interface...using the app feels easy and effortless!","539":"So I just downloaded the app and it's not letting me link my soundcloud tracks.. I'm looking forward to using this","540":"Great App \u2764\ud83d\udc4d","541":"Good \ud83d\udc4d","542":"Vampr gave me a wonderful connection av been looking for","543":"Good","544":"Good","545":"It's cool","546":"I think the limit u put on swipes is stupid. It is not a dating app. We are professionals trying to connect with other professionals and we should be able to maximise that. Some competitor will come,remove the limit and take all your customers. Instead I would suggest get rid of the limit but add ads to monetise it","547":"Nice \ud83d\udc4d","548":"A very slow snail of an app","549":"Those Vampr folks are some real sh#tas#es!!","550":"Cool","551":"Brilliant setup, it is abit slow at times but it really works","552":"useless","553":"It's good","554":"My small business was started just a few years ago. The key to a great business is a solid team. Vampr has been a low cost high value resource to find talent in my industry. Fast responses and real people.","555":"It's too slow please update it","556":"In-app experience is not smooth and not very solid but you can tell it's being improved quickly and it's appreciated, all the new features are cool","557":"The app doesn't open on my phone.It just pauses at the beginning","558":"Worst... Experience...","559":"Plz make it fast it's so so so slowwwwww","560":"Pleassse get better developers for your app! I love your concept, I've got placements because of your platform! But please! Do something about your app! Its full of bugs! It takes billion years to load and introduce dark mode! I reinstalled this app after sometime and now my profile is just isn't loading!","561":"A little slow on my phone but great app","562":"You should put some money in your application too It's not working everything is just blank And you guys are doing promotion No wonder why vampr isn't popular...","563":"Vnice","564":"Your App has a Bug which I detected as a Bug tester.","565":"A good app ... except having little to no response when you are tabbing on ... the following buttons ... Save ... check marks etc","566":"Cool app","567":"Am get one or two connect through vampr i think is a good app","568":"It Jams almost every five minutes. But overall it's a great app","569":"Not terrible, the discover section is a little bad at recognizing my genre and it seems to have a bias towards \"poupular music\". Thus as with every app if your not into pop, rap, or indie good luck finding what your looking for.","570":"I'd definitely recommend this app to connect with musicians worldwide... one tinny problem is that it's a bit slow... tahts it....","571":"I cant add my music","572":"Perfect and have found myself some musicians so far. Only problem is im never notified, hopefully that gets fixed?","573":"I love this idea and I love this app!!!","574":"I'm out here trying to find bandmates but people out here mass-following for clout like it was Instagram or something. Cool concept, bad execution.","575":"App Used To Be Good. Now It Is Just Bugging Out. It Disappoints Me Really Bad. App Sucks Now.","576":"There are more fake accounts than real ones. Which have been set up by the developers to keep you interested. Also 1 months subscription does not mean you will be paying that price for 1-month. They repeatedly charge you that price every month.","577":"Control of personal information is behind a paywall. Surprising that a startup like this would treat their users like that out the gate especially considering all the conversations around privacy these days. Disappointing, I wanted to like it, but the app maker shows that they don't care about would-be users with the desperate move of forcing privacy aware users to pay.","578":"its too damn slow for animation and swiping. my phone hangs almost because of new update. previos versions worked fine. please fix this by getting no animation feature or a lite version.","579":"Lovely","580":"it may not obvious to everyone that you have to press and hold the cloud icon to listen to the performer without entering their full profile","581":"One word. Love it. 4 stars only cuz there's always some room for improvement and updates. \ud83d\ude09","582":"There's always some bugs, freezing the app and people advertising their music schools constantly. So it's kinda annoying.","583":"Its a great app","584":"You have such a good service that you're offering but the myriad of UX issues suck the life out of the experience","585":"Great app and concept but the interface needs to be improved","586":"Super duper app\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764","587":"this app is very helpful, and honestly I've met a few people so far and they are very nice people. it has been almost five years since I've been on this app. I recently got back on it and it still has a weird yet comforting homey friendly vibes to it. would 100% recommend.","588":"Love it","589":"When leaving the app to get the login code, app turns blank and doesn't allow you to enter login code.","590":"Its Good","591":"I am enjoying it. Though i have juat started exploring the platform, at present it has started connecting me with other music lovers, artist, producer and engineers. Hopefully this will lead to a unique and positive ways.","592":"Great app just needs more users","593":"\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\udcaf","594":"Good for connecting with other musicians","595":"Nice app really meeting some good artists and producer's. I give it a four(4)","596":"Feeling it so much","597":"Cool stuff","598":"It works slow, and the interface needs some vision corrections.","599":"Good","600":"Excellent app,","601":"Lots of bug issues there. When we open the application, The screen turns to blank and couldn't access the page.","602":"Not a bad app. My first hour on the app i got some messages of other artists and labels wanting to collaborate or partner up. I'll give it 5 stars. Great job!","603":"its a really good app i think i like it a whole like i like it all the way but its a little hard to press the button","604":"Cool, just could be faster","605":"Best app for ever young thanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a","606":"Lovely app","607":"Awesome","608":"excellent app, I'm happy that it exist","609":"There was an issue where I wasn't able to sign up as there was only a \"login\" button and nothing else. They kindly fixed it and everything is good now!","610":"It's new and interesting ,another way of doing things","611":"Downloaded and couldn't get past the section to enter my skills. Screen just wouldn't load. If it's this buggy simply creating a profile I'm not going to bother with the app. I'll try again in 6 months maybe.","612":"Takes too much time to load","613":"So far so good, this is the way out","614":"travel & food related","615":"Nice app","616":"Amazing!!! Got to meet with SUPERRR TALENTED artists all over the world. This is crazyyyy.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f","617":"Love the costomer support team they helped me a lot \u2764\ufe0f really great app made lots of friends because of it \u2764\ufe0f and spread my music all over the world","618":"Excellent \ud83d\udc4c","619":"The app is not good","620":"You'll get nothing without paying, the app never loads properly even on extremely good Wi-Fi. It is quite laggy. And I think a better way to find musicians is still Facebook or Instagram. This app is kinda useless. I would've given 0 stars if that was possible. I regret installing this \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","621":"Good","622":"Issues with no photos loading at first even after reinstalling and restarting but at some point it started working again","623":"Good)","624":"5 stars (so they won't bury my review)! This is an advertising platform with half baked features that rarely work. Don't bother unless you need yet another app to collect your data and sell you garbage.","625":"Just joined now and so far so good, am having a sweet experience already, I'll recommend it for any music inclined person","626":"Great app, but too many bugs. It'd be nice if you guys fix it.","627":"The app looks really good and the concept is also that will help a lot of musicians, however a lot of ui bugs have made it very difficult to use. I cant remove pictures manualy. I have to press on the upload a new photo button, then it will ask me to remove the latest picture. The problem with that however is that when i do upload a photo the app turns it to a white blanc square...","628":"Every 2-3 days it says, need update stop updating new features first make it smooth to run","629":"I like to try it with my best.....thank you.. Very much.... For this....I like it.very much","630":"Thank you for this app. We can easily find someone to collab. But so many scams, fake accounts.","631":"it's ok, but the whole exact tinder model is a bit ridiculous for this type of app. should follow a model more like Tandem, as this is not a dating app, it's about making meaningful connections. my 2c","632":"Meeting new musicians, which is great","633":"No one uses this","634":"The swiping motion and profile searching need to be smoother to access","635":"So far so good, some performance improvement would be nice though, especially when swiping profiles. Otherwise awesome, keep up the good work ;)","636":"Like this app..but it's not opening today however I have uninstalled and installed several times","637":"This app is fabulous \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udd25\u270c\ufe0f","638":"Wao","639":"I like the app but I will advice that when new updates come out it shldnt be by force to update it","640":"It won't open:( and I can't see my new messages!","641":"Iv met a couple of people and this is indeed an amazing music app","642":"Pleasant! Connected with a bunch of interesting musicians it's a great app of u want feedbacks on your music","643":"cant sign up... stuck on OPEN setting location eveny location ON everytime and has been given permission","644":"I just love this app","645":"Good.. Buono..","646":"Good\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d","647":"V Good","648":"Its helping and also need to be have some changes","649":"Perfect! Helped me a lot!!! But stucks sometimes","650":"Good name","651":"great stuff","652":"Let's work together","653":"Currently can't access the app due to an 'update required' screen, although there is no update option on playstore?","654":"Advertised as \"Tinder for musicians\". Pretty much\ud83d\ude02 the whole swipe thing works very nicely and you can add a message when you swipe too. The coolest part is probably choosing bands you're into so it helps to get to know the person. 5 stars all the way, I joined my band thanks to this!","655":"Good","656":"Its ok... Good concept and all but the swipe limit is dumb","657":"pls fix the update loop, it's said I need to update the app to 5.20 so I did. The app keep update looping like forever now, can't even use the app at all.","658":"I am not able to update this thing on playstore ,so ? And i hope in this update you fixed the bugs like crashes , hang , and it operates a little slow Although this is a great app but kindly fix these issue mam it can vost you a lot of users.","659":"fun","660":"Networking tool. Perhaps you'll find the needle for your haystack?","661":"Needs to improve filters, and performance. But the concept is great!","662":"good","663":"Great app! I've met a few artists through here","664":"Im sorry i got nothing to say about this app. Because i couldnt even use it. I could not register. It asked for permission for my location and i allowed that but it didnt proceed further","665":"The app has so much potential, but I can never get the location to update. It seems like a lot of the other bugs and UI have been sorted, but location still is not updating properly. I've tried clearing cache and data and if I attempt to change location it doesn't update.","666":"Its ok, but doesnt register your preferemces at all!! shows me people totally incompatible mostly., not of my genres, not my age group, and not within any distance thats workable for me. So not much use so far.","667":"Easy to use and hear what other people have. Had a technical problem but it was fixed. 5 stars now.","668":"Connecting to people already","669":"Awesome","670":"This app doesn't have any reach in my area, only 1 other person in a city of 1.5M+ using it, even with a distance of 160km from me. Good concept, needs to gain traction. Currently useless for me. Also, limiting to only selecting 3 genres of music and 3 bands\/artist you like is ridiculous. Should at least be 5","671":"Best artist connector I've found to date.","672":"1 star as the location doesn't get updated at all.. it shows the current location correctly. But the find option shows people from one of the cities I visited a month ago. Tried reinstalling, clearing data... Nothing helps...","673":"It's a nice app.","674":"Still observing","675":"Good app for \u2764\ufe0f me","676":"The app refuse to load on my phone, i even try update it but nothing change, the app only shows the name withy the symbol as if it's an image but it will not open more than that","677":"Its slow but gets the job done","678":"Very useful in finding people to collab","679":"Great app really cool and I hope it cool be more fast","680":"App not working showing that this version have stability issues","681":"This is a great idea. But I dont like the idea of the app you will upgrade and pay so that you can have more scroll to find other musician. This could be better if you will make this app free and put some ads into it. Sorry but app deleted. I will re install it again if you will gonna make atleast 4.5 ratings.","682":"Last time I reviewed this app I was rather frustrated due to the inability to find any connections but now they have introduced a feature called Partial Matching, this feature have actually helped me find some genuine connections and now I love the app even more, but I still think the UI can be improved, I'd suggest you go for some minimal, modern look, simply get rid of those large curves, maybe it's just a matter of taste but you can atleast organise some stuff for sure... Keep it up guys!!!","683":"Only because I couldn't give 0 stars.","684":"Still loving the experience but celebreties are not online and never responding","685":"Beautiful app","686":"So buggy and laggy, fix it, also sooo slow","687":"My videos are unavailable from some time and vampr didn't respond for my message.","688":"Despite the fact that I allowed the location, the app displays the inscription: cannot connect location service. Accordingly, I cannot use the app :( I'm using Xiaomi Remi Note 7. Can anyone help me?","689":"This app used to be free why do you have to pay to get unlinited views if you cant pay you can't find anyone to play with","690":"I like it \u2665\ufe0f","691":"Only reason I deleted my account because I have to pay you guys to hide my age. Ridiculous and cheap.","692":"Excellent","693":"if you don't subscribe to the pro version, You can only post something and it's very limited. And for the price of their music distribution is expensive, you can even distribute your music for just under $20 per year on other platforms","694":"Cool","695":"Pretty good app so far","696":"Iys a good concept, but man! Stories and music takes forever to load, i end up just not listening to anything or watching anything","697":"It's so cool, and I don't even remember the last time I had issues","698":"The distance setting is not working. When I set it to 15km its showing profiles 80km away, when I set it to 7km its showing profiles 200km away. Also pretty glitchy and you have just around 10 swipes per day, regardless of right or left. Nicr idea but bad implementation.","699":"Its cool, pretty fast to find musicians to talk to! Surprised its so effortless, the messenger needs a bit of work it jumps around in messeges when you type or recieve new messeges, and i have to load earlier messeges? what for text is light weight? anywho i wish there was more music site integrations in case you upload on other sites than SoundCloud. But so far the experience has been awesome! BUT i wish there was a skip\/later button because sometimes i cant directly make up my mind imidiately","700":"Guys comeon its a cool idea get a better experienced developer","701":"Nice app","702":"So far I love the experience, I'll give it 5 soon \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd","703":"Doesn't even open","704":"Good app","705":"Tinder for musicians. 'nuff said","706":"Cool app","707":"I recommend this app. Let's connect @conleysupreme","708":"Instagram login never happens","709":"Really cool app, lots of very talented people active on there. I don't know of anything like it. I find it a bit expensive, hense the 4 stars. It's very usable, however there's so much scope for this app to grow such as, video call, a calender, schedule\/ planner, a document that invited participants could edit, file share, the necessary utilities for any collaboration project to really excel.","710":"Wonderful platform for independent artists!","711":"Requires file access and location services to use.","712":"So far looks interesting","713":"It is a great app I just wish it had a voicenote and video call option that would be great but either way my experience has been great I met incredible artists through the app","714":"Waste of time","715":"Great app just buggy and slow react","716":"Great app to connect with other musicians","717":"Its an amazing app need some upgrades","718":"its great and serves its purpose but only problem is im not being notified about anything anymore","719":"This is a brilliant and very Helpful app for growing musicians and those who are seeking band members..just one request though pls remove those profiles which aren't active anymore.","720":"Can do better","721":"Good app","722":"I love this app","723":"They had to over complicate this? Hate the stupid \"tinder\" style and design. You get to see like 15 musicians a day? Then ask us to update to pro? Do you know how much money independent musicians make? Do you know how much we pay for practice rooms and equipment to play for rubbish profits? Run adds to get your money! Don't squeeze money out of us!","724":"It's good but the tinder like limitations set it back from being an amazing app","725":"I would love to use this app but it dont seem to want to load after I enter my account code after creating my account..I'm uninstalling itll just take up space on my phone when I can't even use it...","726":"Good app","727":"The app is great and functioning! Only problem, it makes my phone heat, like A LOT and it uses a lot of battery. Not sure what's going on but this is the only app that does this. Maybe some optimization would be great?","728":"I've been using this app for about 5 days and have made a few connections already... finding like minded people in the sa M e space with similar goals is great... I just wish the premium was free.","729":"Subscription based app. Useless app. \ud83d\udc4e","730":"The app concept is pretty good but they have to really improve the UI experience","731":"To be honestly can't really rate this app the way they asking me these questions but in my phone didn't work I'm using samsung galaxy A 3 Core like for an example I want to post a video or a song it will ask which platform I want to use youtube or vimeo and I click youtube and after that it will show me to select a video but it doesn't show any video list or any video and that's the problem I have with this app please guys fix it quick because I really love the vision you have for us as artis","732":"I cant install this app","733":"Greta app for connecting with other musicians \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc","734":"Love it","735":"Right place to look for music contacts... Hope more people will use it","736":"Artists need such platform","737":"Absolutely aggressive garbage . The first this they do is ask for your personal info, which you fill in as part of the registration process, fair enough. The second thing, they make all that information available publicly, and if you want to hide it you need to pay\/subscribe. It amazes me that this kind of thing are still allowed. One star because it can't be zero.","738":"I am unable to access my account, I had some bugs there so thought of re-installing it but now, I can't login my account. It foes not go any further after entering the confirmation code...Its really frustrating cuz i had many ppl there whom I was talking to, plz plz plzz do something \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Please help me...","739":"This app is great but I just lost all my chats its showing that I have a message but I can't find it all chat log is cleared.","740":"Useless it is...","741":"The app isnt opening now. Almost two days not working properly.","742":"Very helpful for new and upcoming stars.","743":"Just one word to say, \"thnks\"","744":"Well this app is good so far... I was able to find and connect with other good musicians from diffrent places. It sure would be great if they could make this app available for pc users too...","745":"Superb application \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a","746":"The idea of the app is amazing.But the app, technically, is full of bugs.A lot...I have a hard time using it. Most of the buttons wont often work.Its sad. I mean the UI is fine and the idea behind the app is brilliant.Yet the functioning is dissappointing.I hope you get it ready cuz Id love to use it.","747":"Good app","748":"Great app. Meeting some cool creative people","749":"While typing connection request message It suddenly reject that person Fix this bug asap","750":"There's no one here...","751":"Its a very good app for meeting good musicians, the only thing I'm not a fan of is that you have to pay for a lot of features.","752":"Good idea, very buggy It's free, but there are paid premium features. There also seems to be a music distribution service, but they don't explain why it's better than cheaper alternatives (DistroKid etc) There is nothing more irritating than writing a message to someone before you send a request, then the app then decides to close the message mid-type. You to then have to pay to rewind to a previous match. As others have said, it's buggy and slow but probably worth the free sign up","753":"App is good, but i have some troubles with the messages. They don't appear fully. Some parts are missing. I think it's cuz of big resolution on my phone","754":"Vary fast reply. Easy to use app.","755":"Very helpful for meeting new musician","756":"Good","757":"Such an amazing app to find musicians to collab with.I got a lot of musician friends from vampr.Best app for people who love music.","758":"Don't care for the design that requires me to decide on a single artist before I can look at another. This is like QVC. Show me a store full of options... not a single kumquat at t time.","759":"Ho sakta hai aabhi ky laga pata nahi","760":"Great app for networking!","761":"Great app! No bugs so far \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd","762":"It's lagging. But I met musicians through it and this is great.","763":"Really really bad","764":"Creo que es un error limitar la vista de los perfiles, pierden usuarios de esa forma","765":"Brilliant app! Super easy to make connections and it actually quite entertaining and informative seeing all the different types of musicians that ate out there. Would very much recommend it!","766":"Extremely buggy. Messages don't load and sometimes if you back out of it and go back it disappears completely. I'd be worried about who I might have lost contact with because of this. Profiles also don't load sometimes.","767":"Takes forever to load, despite location being turned on freezes at the start asking you to turn it on. The app starting successfully is a game of chance. Too frustrating","768":"I installed it...press Open app...it never opens ....I have an Android OS system on a smartphone ....bizarre..cannot use at all....sorry","769":"Good app. It's just every last word of the message is invisible. So it's hard to know what people are trying to say. And the app could be more responsive.","770":"amazing app","771":"Really fun app!","772":"Loved it !!","773":"Best App","774":"Very good app for contacting with other music lovers","775":"Very convenient app!! Liked it!","776":"Great app fo real music lovers.","777":"Perfect app for music lovers!","778":"Great app to find musicians!!!","779":"This is honestly the best platform for any musician. Loved it\ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udfb8","780":"Very user friendly","781":"It's fun, and a very entertaining app, loved it!!","782":"One of the best platforms I came across to discover new musicians and promote yourself too!","783":"It is a user friendly app. A very helpful app.","784":"Clunky, slow and not very helpful for musicians. The feed makes no sense, mines just full of people I've never followed. The fact you have to pay to upload photos, videos and music after a certain point is a poor design choice - Itjust stifles the purpose for downloading the app. As for the community, unfortunately you'll only get people from abroad \"looking to colab\" rather than actual musicians and an ability to work to any level of decency remotely, though I can't blame Vampyr for that.","785":"Nice app\u2764","786":"Nice medium to reach with other artists","787":"It is pretty good.","788":"It works like tinder, you should swipe to find people to play with. Not useful for a musician. Plus the new function don't work for me, a lot of bugs.","789":"This app has an underwhelming amount of Eric Estrada content. It's pretty much non-existence. If you're trying to buy cheap Florida real estate from Eric Estrada, this is far from the correct application to use. Not impressed.","790":"Great way to meet let artists and producers. We love this app.","791":"I like this apps","792":"I cant open the app","793":"What the hell is this? No networking on it, no communication with others.
